"April 14, 2018",The Dolphin,2.0,513,"Delightful coffee maker if you’re only looking to use it for one year. The design of this is so flawed, you’ll find the flow of the pour decreasing... and decreasing... and decreasing, all the while cleaning it as it instructs you to do. It never gets clean, but that does not stop it from wanting more cleaning. It will take you 68 minutes to fill one cup of coffee, as it trickles out at the speed of an icicle melting in 33 degree weather. Then, one day you’ll notice more coffee on your countertop than your cup. You’ll assume that you’re just tired and mistakingly spilling your coffee in your non caffeinated state. You take the blame. It’s not you. Hamilton Beach is against you. They designed this machine to slowly test your patience and convince you that you’re insane. It torments you with request to clean, fully knowing... it can never be cleaned. It will toy with your emotions until one day you crack and throw it out the front door. Or so I’ve heard. I “would never do such a thing.”"
"February 7, 2019",Karen Kaffenberger,1.0,122,"UPDATE: Bought this 10-21-18 and I finally retired this POS to the trash Sept 2019. I've added two new photos to show how the leakage has gotten worse throughout the year. This model was poorly engineered. I have NEVER had a coffee pot leak like this. I replaced it with a Bonavita (through Amazon) and am quite pleased. I've owned 2 other previous incarnations of this model, and bought this one because I really like this design and had worn out the old one. I have now had this new one for 3 months so I think it's had a good trial. PROS: No glass carafe to break. Digital programming for coffee strength & for iced, different settings for ""keep warm"", and timer are easy to use and great to have. Beeps loudly when the coffee is ready.  Makes coffee reasonably fast. Coffee tastes good even after being on ""keep warm"" for 2 hrs. Fits under kitchen cabinet on sink. Love the press-to-pour lever--comes out well. Light colored interior numbers on inside of the chamber makes it easy to see when you have poured in the correct amount of water. CONS: The water/coffee chamber has been redesigned, & I can't say I'm a fan. It's harder to clean than the old model, and if you get too zealous pouring the water (like I do) it will splash out when it hits the crossbar. The water/coffee chamber no longer fits together snugly with the base--not sure why, but there is a small gap along the back vertical part. Mug rest under the coffee lever is incredibly small. A normal sized mug cannot sit comfortably on there. The biggest CON-- IT LEAKS. (see photo) The amount of coffee leakage is proportional to the number of cups made, i.e., when I make 10 cups it leaks way more than if I make 4. Also not exactly sure where the leak is coming from--it does not appear to leak when the lever is pushed to get the coffee. OTHER THINGS TO NOTE: On the old model, the lid was removable. On this model, the lid flips up. Since I have to move the coffeemaker  back & forth (due to lack of counter space) I sometimes accidentally hit the clock/timer buttons because of their placement. The mug rest detaches easily for cleaning, but tends to be loose (a minor thing). FINAL TAKE: Not worth the money, leaks, and requires a lot of effort to keep it from staining the counter top."
"December 23, 2017",C1C3C11,4.0,185,"The big reason I ordered this was because I was tired of dealing with coffee carafes. I liked the idea that it was a combination of 12-cup coffee maker with the convenience of a Keurig. And on that level it didn't disappoint. However there are few things I find annoying about it. Like most people who use a coffeemaker, it sits on my countertop underneath my cabinets. And of course in order to fill it, clean it, or whatever, I have to pull it out from the wall. I run into a problem with the little silicon rubber feet on the base. If I slide it across the countertop, the feet pop out of the base and I have to re-insert them. So to avoid that I have to lift the device. However the drip tray in the front is detachable, so it comes off each time I lift it. I know that is minor stuff, but like I said, it's annoying. Keeping it clean is just a little easier than the carafe dripmakers I have owned. That is because it is much easier to clean the water reservoir than in most conventional dripmakers. Technically the urn and filter basket are stacked on top of the reservoir in the base. Since the coffee urn is removable, the reservoir is completely accessible for cleaning. As with all dripmakers you still need to perform the vinegar ritual to remove scale from the elements, but at least you can keep the reservoir quite clean from accumulating residue. All in all, it makes a pretty good cup of coffee. I set it up at night and program it to brew before I get up in the morning. Since it can keep the coffee warm for up to 4 hours, I normally brew about 6 to 8 cups and hit on it throughout the day. I know that's a mortal sin for coffee aficionados and snobs, but then I doubt they would even look at coffeemakers like these."
"November 26, 2016",Paul Roberts,5.0,224,"I've owned several of their older brewstation models over the last 7yrs. Those after 2.5 yrs have always stopped dispensing as the prong begins to flex due to the heat and wont push the coffee release valve as much eventually leading to no coffee coming out. The big pain was the old design allowed condensation from the lid to drip into the wells under the coffee carafe and it would overflow into the drip tray, thenmix with dripped coffee inside, and then run all over the counter on the 3rd pot. You'd have to remember to tip the entire machine into the sink to empty those wells. BUT- this model is much improved! Those two issues are gone. As far as others here saying it won't dispense with thick cups....not sure what they heck they are filling...maybe a stone chiseled mug with 2 inch rim thickness...I don't know. I have no issues with normal ""thick rim mugs"" with my unit.  See my picture of it pouring into my thick mug. The spout output is at least 1 inch from the button. If your mug does not clear, you need another mug. No condensation at all on my unit either. They have put in two fixes with a much improved catch ramp built into the coffee filter holder and the area at the top back at the lid hinge now allows the condensation to drip directly into the water well where you pour the water. Problems solved! I think competitors write bogus reviews to scare people into not buying the product. Don't listen to it. This is the new and improved version! It's narrower, more compact, has a bold setting and does not drip lid condensation into the drip tray like the old one did. This one rocks! The only thing that's nit picky is filling it with water. Using the coffee carafe you need to rinse it well first. Or, you need another container marked at 12 cups to use to fill it with each time. Other than that, perfection with this version."
"November 28, 2017",JennyD,3.0,116,"I agonized over which coffee maker to purchase for months. What I think makes the perfect coffee is a pour-over and I have 2 of those.  The problem with them is that the heat doesn't stay for long.  Winter time is my extra coffee time and so I wanted a new drip to do the job for me and so that I could have coffee during the day without having to re-perk.  I do not like the warming trays as they continue to cook coffee and ugh, that's not good.  THIS coffee maker is sublime.  It arrived today, I cleaned it thoroughly and made the first small pot on the 1-4 setting. YUM.  Even an hour later it tasted fresh perked.  Now I have it set for 8 cups with the timer on for tomorrow morning and I can hardly wait. I'll be honest and say that pour overs are still the best but time consuming, but this Hamilton Beach (with no carafe) is the best drip coffee maker I've ever used.  People talk about leaking, and I say read the instructions, and that goes for any leak or any taste.  This one is fabulous! ______________________________ Well, here's an update, and I've removed 2 stars.  It's still a great coffeeMAKER (I stress the maker part), BUT, you know that hour later where it was still great tasting? Now it's not.  I can't say it's a burned taste, but it IS an overcooked taste even though there is no burner that a carafe would sit on.  I think the heater that keeps the coffee hot (and it does stay hot) actually continues to cook.  Even the color of the coffee is much darker.  This is my only gripe, but it's an important one.  Bottom line is, make the amount of coffee you'll drink fairly quickly and you'll be very happy, but don't leave the tank for hours with the idea it's going to taste 'just perked'."
"January 23, 2019",Pauline Matthews,1.0,76,"I loved the convenience of having a coffee brewer that kept the coffee hot for a few hours. I was satisfied with the product until I woke up one morning with  the remaining coffee left in the pot overnight all over my countertop. I read the instruction booklet, cleaned the pot as instructed and made more coffee only to have the same thing happen again. This happened several times in a row over several days of use. I finally got frustrated and bought another coffee pot. I am not writing to complain or ask for a refund, but simply to inform you that the pot I got from you was defective so that you can check it out for yourselves. The problem I had happened from the site where you pushed the cup against the pot to fill it with coffee. It never shut completely and continued to drip until the pot was empty of any remaining coffee. Easy to replace a pot, but not so easy to replace a counter top or a cabinet."
"April 19, 2018",Kris K.,5.0,85,"This is my second Brewstation - the first one lasted 11 years but it experienced an accident :( , and we liked it so we replaced it with pretty much the same thing.  It's funny to see people telling others what they will or will not experience; I guess such folks must be psychic :p  Sorry, I'm not, so I can't predict what others will experience - I can only describe what I experienced. That being said, since we replaced our dropped one with the same thing, I guess it's obvious that *we* like it, LOL!  Now, the one I ordered *was* described as ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"", and yes, that *is* something I do look for because, over the past 12+ years, I have never had any problems with items whenever Amazon has been the vendor.  So, my Brewstation arrived quickly and in perfect condition, and this Ultra model was apparently on sale <?> as well, so it actually cost a bit less than the first one had cost nearly 12 years ago. We washed it as per the directions, set it up, and so far, it's running perfectly. Neither our previous one, nor this one, seems to me to be ""slow"", even though I always use the ""Bold"" option.  I like strong coffee (and buy good quality coffee to begin with), and the Brewstation seems to do a good job there:  neither too fast, nor too slow, at least, in my personal opinion.  I do like that this coffee maker has no ""carafe"" for the coffee to splash off of as it drips into the pot, OR that can break into a thousand shards if dropped, knocked, or otherwise meets an end now that my balance and coordination are not what they used to be.  I also like that the lid controls the steam better, since there is more than enough humidity in Houston, especially in the summer! The stainless-steel plate in the front is brighter than the plain black, but for me personally, that's not something I'd pay extra for - though it's nice that it's there."
"September 12, 2019",Shannon,1.0,49,"I want to say right up front that this is the THIRD Hamilton Beach Brew Station I've purchased.  The first one I purchased lasted about 5-6 years.  I bought one for my Dad because he raved about it when he came to visit.  So when that one finally died, I had no problem searching for another one.  I loved the changes they made from the original BrewStation.  Having the fill reservoir on the side was an absolute win for me.  No dumping and dripping.  Just fill and pop it back on.  It had the same brew settings I loved from the original and the ""Keep Warm"" time options.  It performed just as I expected it to.  Until it hit about the 8 month mark.  Just so we're clear, I cleaned it monthly using the vinegar cycle just as directed.  Holding the vinegar in place for 30 minutes after allowing it to briefly start a brewing cycle.  I never used harsh cleaning products because, ewwwww.....gross.  That's one sure way to eff up your coffee for awhile.  So, yeah.  It was cleaned often and as it was supposed to be.  First problem:  the reservoir that holds the warm coffee started to drip/leak from the dispenser.  I cleaned it thoroughly and that's about all you can do.  If there was coffee in the dispenser it dripped......and you come home to a LAKE on your counter.  So you either had to leave a cup under the dispenser to catch the drip or put all of the coffee into a carafe (which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the BrewStation).  So that's what we were doing and I fired off an e-mail to Hamilton Beach.  Literally, the very next day, we encountered the second problem.  The coffee maker started only running through part of the brew cycle and then it would shut down.  At first, I thought the setting must have been changed to 1-4 cups.  It wasn't.  It was set to run a full 12-cup brew......but it's like the coffee pot was randomly deciding how much effort it wanted to put in on any given day.  Sometimes we ended up with 2 cups of coffee and 10 cups of water remaining in the reservoir.  Sometimes half and half.  Most of the time.....like 95%......it would run 8 cups of coffee and leave 4 cups of water sitting in the reservoir.  That's not even an option on the damn coffee maker.  There is no ""make 2/3 pot"" option.  So, when HB answered me back about the drip problem, which was to pay for another coffee reservoir and pay for shipping, I fired back an e-mail telling them about the new problem.  Silence.  CRICKETS.  Still nothing.  This all happened inside of the 1-Year Limited Warranty.  I hadn't registered the coffee pot with HB when purchased and it was obviously outside the 30 day return window from Amazon.  I don't know what I'll end up buying.  For now I drug an old Mr. Coffee out of the pantry and it's still chugging away.  I see a few other reviews on here where people have had similar problems.  Just wanted to let others know that while Hamilton Beach BrewStation was awesome out of the gate, there is the potential for problems shortly after purchase.  Fair warning."
"September 7, 2015",bluzdogs,3.0,169,"UPDATE: May 17, 2016 After ~8 months of daily use, we've discovered that somewhere along the design chain something was either overlooked or ignored. As I said in my first review, there's a lot to love about the redesign of this unit. But something's not right. About 6 months in, the reservoir that holds the brewed coffee began to leak. I contacted HB and was told I had to pay $5.99 shipping and they would send a replacement. Fine. The new reservoir works fine. No leaks since. At least no brewed coffee leaks. (BTW, turns out, bleach is the culprit for that. Simply put, DON'T use bleach at all, to remove coffee residue inside the filter rack or the hot beverage reservoir. Not even just a tiny amount. But for the next issue, almost from the start, we started noticing a large amount of condensation on the lid that covers the coffee filter assembly. Since there's nowhere for the water to really go, it just pools into the two channels on either side of the hotplate underneath the coffee reservoir (Photos A & C). There are only two ways to remove that water. 1) Take the BrewStation apart, flip it over & dump out the water, or 2) much more simply, use a turkey baster to suction out the water. Repeat at least every other day because there's up to 1/2 cup of condensation created every day (B). If you don't get rid of the excess water, one fine morning, you'll be greeted by a thin layer of water all over your counter. This problem was completely absent in the first unit we purchased. Other than this nuisance, the Brewstation is a great alternative for keeping coffee hot without burning it as do traditional coffee makers. As I mentioned in my original post, this design is convenient for those confined to wheelchairs to be able to get their own coffee themselves. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Our first Brewstation lasted about 6 years, so buying another didn't require much thought. Consumer Reports pooh-poohed this line because its brewing temperature is about 10° higher than the ""optimal"" 185°, but I don't really care. We live & care for my wife's invalid mother, who is confined to a wheelchair. Since there's no decanter, she can get her own coffee easily by herself. Plus, because of the machine's unique design, the coffee will hold for the full four hours without tasting like the gear oil from a poorly maintained, 1967 model dump truck. Versus the old model, I love the removable water reservoir and the light on the display is much brighter. While we seldom make iced coffee on purpose, it's nice that the feature is built in. Also, this  one is about$15 cheaper than the original we bought in 2009. My only negative is that the front panel of the coffee reservoir gets *extremely* ' HOT!  Ordinarily, it's not a problem. But if, for example, you're cleaning the machine and run consecutive brew cycles, the ""chrome"" plate on the front, even though it's plastic, will scorch your bare skin. You've been warned! Otherwise, this coffee maker is a winner! Hamilton Beach knocked this one out of the park."
"February 26, 2017",Ivan Veraja,1.0,92,"Bought this coffee maker in September 2016 - less than 6 months ago. It was great at first, really liked the design. But now the paint/plastic inside the coffee reservoir is corroding off INTO THE COFFEE. Every time I rinse it out flecks of black paint/plastic come washing out as well - lots of flecks. It's coming off from the little windows that let you know how much coffee is left, and also along the bottom of the reservoir. I can't imagine having paint & plastic steeping in our coffee is good for us. Time to go back to a regular coffee maker with glass carafe."
"October 15, 2016",Brian Colon,5.0,171,"Let me start by saying that I have owned the previous model of Brew Station (Model 48464) for about four years with multiple pots of coffee brewed a day, loved every minute of having it. We decided to upgrade only because the coffee maker started to show its age. It started to leak behind the dispensing lever despite regular cleaning, and the flow of the coffee dramatically decreased over time. We liked the unit so much we decided to try the newer model of the Brew Station. New model (Model 48465): We have had this new model for a few days now, it functions exactly the same as when we purchased the older model. It has great flow to the dispensing area, brew time for a full pot takes about 5 minutes. there are only a few cosmetic differences between the two models that are shown in the attached images: The buttons on the new unit are rectangular instead of circular on the old The Blue display is brighter on the new display is brighter than the old (makes it look better) Back-splash of the newer unit has a stainless steel finish rather than the black plastic of the old unit. I do like the look of the stainless on the back-splash but I am unsure of how clean it will stay with regular use. As far as the $5 price difference, whether you should choose the older model over the new is strictly cosmetic. If you like the look of the stainless back-splash, the buy the newer model. If you can live with the black plastic back-splash buy the older model and save yourself the $5."
"June 8, 2018",CaffinatedWolf,1.0,50,"To start with, the unit came with only 2 rubber feet, both on the backside of the bottom, so it didn't sit level on the counter, AND when you push your cup onto the button to get coffee, the entire unit slides on the counter unless you hold it in place because it doesn't have all 4 rubber feet.  Second, I love dark roast coffee, but the coffee tastes burned, regardless which brew setting you use. Third, and last but not least, Hamilton Beach customer service is either unknowledgable or unwilling to even send me a set of rubber feet to rectify the sliding across the counter situation.  In fact, I was told by Hamilton Beach customer support that this unit only comes with 2 rubber feet, and they do not offer the rubber feet as a replacement or warranty part.  I have had several products from Hamilton Beach in the past, and they were decent quality, but after this I will no longer buy anything producted by them."
"July 25, 2018",L. L.,4.0,41,"I've purchased every brand out there over 30 years, I like this one better, so far. It makes great ""Hot"" coffee, is easy to use, also makes a fast cup of coffee or a full pot, (((quietly)), which I love!!  I'd give it a ""5"" stars but after it's done..it's really wet when you open the lid..even hours later...to take out the grounds, or make another pot, it just stays wet and makes for a mess any time you open that lid. Otherwise it's a good value for the money..I've paid a lot more, for other coffee makers brands, and not had coffee be as hot as this one ( I like it that way) or be so quiet. Arrived fast and securely.Over all a good value for me.I never tried this brand before, it's a pleasant surprise.."
"April 24, 2019",Rebecca,1.0,27,"I purchased this coffee maker just 6 months ago because it seemed like a fun design. Unfortunately, I instantly came to regret my decision and immediately began to experience problems with the design and usability of the machine. My first observation about this machine was how difficult it is to pour the water into the back of it. We had this coffee maker for 6 months and every morning for 6 months I flooded my kitchen counter with brownish water and cursed the coffee gods for what they had done to me. But the pouring problems were really the least of my troubles. In order to pour water, you have to open the machine. If I was able to manage pulling it out from beneath the cabinets without the top popping off in my hands, I was doing pretty good. But, I was literally never able to pull it out to fill it without the rubber feet popping off. The first time I used the machine, one rubber foot popped off, bounced across the floor and rolled under the refrigerator. Within a few more days, the other two rubber feet had also popped out. I would pop them back in every morning after sliding the machine back under the cabinets. I tried desperately to hang on to them... I really did, but, eventually all three feet disappeared into the dark crevices of my kitchen never to be found again, which led to an even bigger problem... Without the rubber feet, dispensing a cup of coffee will send the entire machine accelerating across the countertop at warp speed like a bar of wet soap. The only solution I could find for this problem was to move the coffee maker to a corner so it would have two solid walls keeping it in place. We consume a lot of coffee in our house and we usually end up having to make a second pot. This presents a real problem with this machine because the bucket that holds the coffee and keeps it hot is also the bucket you have to remove to refill the water in the machine. Basically, if you want a second pot, you have to reach your hand into a scalding hot, steaming, wet container and say a prayer. Since the hot plate that warms the coffee is literally IN the coffee it gets caked with burnt coffee really quickly, which then makes all of your coffee taste burned and makes for a lot of extra cleaning and scrubbing. Despite all of these problems, I wanted to get my money's worth out of this coffee maker, so we made it work. But now, we're 6 months into this ordeal and the coffee maker has begun to leak. I finally put this machine out to trash today, and I have to say, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted."
"April 12, 2018",Michael Strausbaugh,1.0,46,"At first I had given this coffee maker a five star, thought it was great. I was completely wrong. It leaks all the time. I had to stop using because inside where the coffee goes is coming off. When I rinse it out little black chunk's of the paint is coming off. Very unsafe. Was even getting head aches. Major health issue. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
"May 20, 2017",Warnali,5.0,52,"We have had this coffee maker for two days now and it is by far the best one we have purchased. I read the reviews before buying and I have to say, some aren't fair. The coffee maker basically comes ready to use when you buy it. To put the water in it, is not hard and it doesn't make a mess if you pour it correctly. It's very easy to use, we did not read any instructions. The temperature of the coffee is perfect. When and if this does break, we will be purchasing again. It does in fact beep, very low (once), it will not wake anyone up."
"June 16, 2017",Danielle,5.0,33,"After hours of deciding which coffee maker to get I bought this one, and I haven't been dissapointed. The stainless steel looks awesome and matches my fridge and stove. The small plate under the dispenser comes out for easy cleaning, and it's actual metal. (I had a kuerig and it was plastic).  It's easy to fill with water and easy to see how many cups are in it. It brews delicious perfect drinking temperature coffee. The added functions (bold, 1-4 cups) really do make a difference. There is a side measurement on the coffee maker so you can see how much coffee is left. I noticed if there is less than 2 cups to just turn it off so it starts to burn. The dispenser is tall enough to fit a travel mug under. Also I want to note that when the coffee maker says 1 cup does NOT mean 1 mug/cup of coffee. To fill an average sized mug/cup you need 2-3 cups of brewed coffee."
"November 9, 2017",Mary B,1.0,36,"So this was my third Hamilton Beach coffee maker in 7 years and each one has been worse then the first. Simply put, its leaks. I biought this one in March of 2017. It didnt even make it a year. Its leaking and make a mess all over my kitchen counter. Don't waste your money."
"July 11, 2017",Nevis Rik,3.0,58,"I owned another BrewStation model before, and loved the way it made coffee. When a small part broke inside, it wouldn't dispense coffee anymore. The company doesn't offer that part (?!), so I had to buy a new BrewStation. The new one looked fine, but I discovered a manufacturing crack inside. Amazon sent a replacement right away. The replacement looked like it had been used before. The outside was ""scuffed & scratched."" The inside also looked used. I couldn't smell coffee, and the box was obviously brand new, so I washed everything and polished it as best I could. It makes great coffee. I actually think the ""used"" appearance is simply from poor quality control in the manufacturing process. Strange. Also, the little drip grill underneath the dispenser is so flimsy and cheap, it makes the whole coffee maker seem cheap. Plus, when you hold your cup under the dispenser to get coffee, the BrewStation actually slides away from you. The feet not only don't hold the coffee maker, they make skid marks on the counter."
"October 26, 2017",DBeem191,3.0,28,"I love the concept of this pot (no carafe) but I didn't realize until I got it, that due to the height of the unit, it must be pulled away from the wall before you can remove the internal pieces to clean and fill with water. I also didn't realize that the internal pieces would be wet and drippy when refilling or that pouring the water into the pot would be so awkward due to the design of the container. It makes good coffee though! Regarding at least one other review that stated the coffee wasn't hot enough, my first cup is just the right temperature to drink right away without cooling, which I actually prefer. The rest of the coffee is hotter when given time to warm on the heating element."
"January 30, 2020",Smokiechick,2.0,9,"I have owned several versions of the Hamilton Beach BrewStation over the years. I have never been disappointed with them before. First time for everything. I have a large family and brew 12 cups every morning. It takes 4 to fill my travel mug. It's been just over a month since the new one arrived and it's disappointing. Halfway through brewing, it stops. Just stops like it thinks it's done. I've figured out that if I turn it off and back on again it will finish the pot. That just seems like an unnecessary step, to me. ADDENDUM: It's not broken. It's just overly dramatic. Took the time to do a good clean of the system and it works like a champ again. You would think it could turn on the ""Clean"" on the display; but, it would rather just stop working and give you the silent treatment. Because you know what you did and it shouldn't have to tell you."
"April 22, 2018",Aaron Johnson,2.0,19,This is my second Hamilton Beach dispenser style coffee maker. I had the older version for 7-8 years and loved it. When it came time to replace it- I of course wanted the same type. This model was updated with the water reservoir on the side- which is an improvement. Unfortunately- they have downgraded to very cheap plastic for the body and components. I dropped the water reservoir in my sink when filling it one morning and the hinge for the lid broke off on one side because it is thin plastic. The dispenser button sticks inside the frame of the body continuously which pours coffee all over my counter. It happens about 50% of the time when dispensing. I have to use the end of a spoon or fork to pull the dispensing button out of the frame which stops the coffee from flowing. I never had this issue with the old design in 7-8 years. Hamilton Beach needs to fix this- it is a major issue.
"March 10, 2018",ButchJ,1.0,19,"This is the worst  coffee maker that I have ever used in my 55 years of making coffee.. It does not heat the water enough to actually cook the coffee. The coffee is luke warm at best when pouring into the cup. It is difficult pouring the coffee into the cup.You have to hold the back of the coffee maker in order to push the button so the coffee will pour into the cup. Sadly I disposed of the original box so I cannot return it. This coffee maker is so bad, I won't give it to Goodwill or to a friend. It will go in the trash where it belongs.Don't buy this junk!"
"January 4, 2019",Chinon,5.0,8,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my mom. She is very peculiar about how she drinks her coffee. I have never been able to convert her to a pour over or french press method. It's drip coffee or die. Her Mr. Coffee maker was CRIPPLED after continuously being used to brew burnt tasting coffee, yet she persisted in using that pathetic little thing. When she finally confessed that she needed a new coffee maker, I knew I had to introduce her to something new -- but not TOO new. Having said that, she LOVES this coffee maker. She understood how to use it the first time I explained it to her (a serious perk for someone who can't figure out how to use Google Maps!) and, I kid you not, text messages me every morning to say how delicious her coffee tastes now. Her favorite feature is the keep warm function, which has in all likelihood increased her coffee consumption. I personally prefer other methods of brewing, but I do admit this maker can brew a tasty cup that I appreciate having when I go to visit my mama. Highly recommend as an upgrade for the drip coffee lover."
"April 20, 2018",Missy,5.0,20,"I read the questions section and the review section of this brewer. It took me a couple days. I decided to order it. I waited a couple weeks to review it. First, to the people concerned with water under the machine: I figured this out. There is a hole in the back of the machine where the bottom meets the top. If you pour the water in too fast, or move it after filling it, the water will come out of this hole. See my pictures. Also,  much like with any brewer I've had, when you lift the lid, the water will run down the back side of the machine. The coffee is super hot after it's brewed. Whether I wait for it to finish brewing or not. It's MUCH hotter than my Keurig ever made. Steaming hot! I do find that well into the 3rd hour of 4 hour keep warm function, it's not as hot, but still good. I tried to reset the warm function after the time ran out and it did not really heat the coffee back up. So try to drink it all before the initial time runs out and the pot shuts off. I do still notice a little bubbling noise after the brew cycle is complete. It's from the warning plate but it's not loud and my coffee never has that bitter, burnt taste. Mine also beeps when it's done brewing. That is also not super loud. I can hear it, my husband can't. It also brews much faster than my old pot. The 1-4 cup brew option, as well as the bold brew option, do cause it to brew slower. There may not be a typical carafe, but the coffee still goes somewhere and you do still need to wash it. However, there's no worrying about breaking glass and with it being a big open container, there's no trying to squeeze your hand in it to wash it. And I have small hands. None of the parts are dishwasher safe. But it's super easy to wash so I don't care. I do have a reusable filter but I find that the lid did not fully close when I used it. It still brewed just fine. The lid wasn't open enough to hinder the brewing process in any way. I need to find one that fits better. All in all, I'm supper happy with my decision. I had a pot that just didn't make good coffee anymore and my poor Keurig needed a rest. I also included pictures of the directions and troubleshooting."
"October 30, 2019",Anne,1.0,6,"I first purchased this Hamilton Beach coffee maker about ten years ago, and it was wonderful--kept the coffee hot inside and dispensed without issues. But the last two we've owned haven't lasted very long (two years, then one year) before the coffee stopped being hot enough. Also, the coffee grounds splash all over the inside of the maker (which the first one didn't do). I was reticent to purchase this model again but couldn't find an alternative in my search on Amazon (we love the dispenser ""on demand"" style maker). This time, the dispenser leaked coffee all over each time we tried to use it. I do thank Amazon for allowing us to return it for a full refund. I did find an ""on demand"" dispenser style maker from Cuisinart that works great and is everything we want--without all the flaws. I have to knock Amazon down some points for not showing the Cuisinart in my original search, though they do sell it. I ended up buying it elsewhere online, THEN Amazon started highlighting it in their email advertisements."
"January 15, 2018",Dorothy G.,1.0,18,Bought this a little over 3 months ago. It leaked for the first few days and then stopped. About a month ago it started leaking again and the leaking just got worse and worse. Hamilton Beach just has not mastered this type of technology. We are going back to the old brewmaster which we’ve had for the last five plus years and we’re happy with😞.
"September 29, 2019",DstnD,1.0,4,"The actuator lever in the base (that pushes the lever on the tank to dispense coffee) broke, and now it no longer dispenses when you press your cup against it. This cannot be solved with a replacement tank, and there are no relevant replacement parts to be found. However, before this happened, the coffee maker was problematic from the start. The water reservoir likes to leak all over the counter after being set up the night before, so we wake up to a puddle of water instead of a pot of coffee. The strangest part: I don't have this issue if I place the water reservoir on *twice* AND put the water reservoir on before placing the coffee tank. That's right. No matter how carefully I seat the reservoir and tank, it will leak water if I don't fill the reservoir, put it in place, lift it off, put it back, and -then- put the coffee tank on. This also suffers from the same problem as the HB 48465 series; where the little mesh dome filter in the coffee tank gets clogged, the washer inside gets caked in coffee residue, and it will develop both slow-dispense issues, and leaky washer issues. No, the vinegar washes are not enough - the water mineral filters are not enough. We're not supposed to be able to remove that filter or maintenance the washer - just throw the coffee maker away and buy a new one. However, if you're gentle enough, you can pop that little dome filter out with a butter knife soak the mesh part in some orange-clean or something to get it flowing again (wash it VERY WELL afterward if you use something that harsh, but it's been necessary - just don't wash the tank itself with orange clean). The main weak point is the rubber washer. It can be cleaned, but it will eventually begin to degrade and leak. I was unable to find any kind of rubber washer that would fit and work for this machine, I've resorted to flipping the washer over periodically, turning it a few degrees, etc. I'm down to 1 washer position left that doesn't cause a persistent coffee drip. I love the BrewStations, we've purchased several because despite these issues; it's programmable, stays hot for 4 hours and no carafe - for less money than the similar Cuisinart products that have potentially more-annoying issues. However, I would stay away from this specific BrewStation model, and stick to the HB 48465 series. It has fewer points of failure, and the coffee tank filter and washer issues can be... worked with."
"January 22, 2019",J. Crumley,5.0,8,"I have had numerous coffee makers... including two different kinds of Keurigs.  This is the absolute most favorite out of all coffee makers I have ever had.  It is so easy to use, and clean.  It keeps coffee hot up to four hours.  Or you can even make cold coffee too.  It comes out as like a soda machine.  No more heavy coffee pots for hurting hands.  Kcups are too expensive if you like to realllly drink coffee.  You just add water to the (detachable) reservoir  - how ever much you want  - put the coffee in on top and press a button!  That is it!  It can even be programmed to make coffee at whatever time your heart desires.  This is the BEST ever!!"
"February 2, 2018",G. Roth,4.0,10,"I got this one as an upgrade to another HB Brewstation without the removable reservoir. I don't know if anything has changed over the years of this coffee maker. Mine had a minor design flaw. The warmer plate has 4 W1 security screws. The heads are too tall for the reservoir to sit properly. This leaves a very tiny gap between the two metal plates. The gap causes a constant bubbling/brewing sound and prevents the coffee from maintaining a high enough warmer temperature. I looked to see if I could find a thinner head screw with the same threads in my hardware stash. I was unable so I sanded down the heads of each screw about 10 thousandths. The coffee maker is now completely silent when it is done brewing. You could temp fix the problem with a sheet or two of aluminum foil going over the top and edges. Just make sure it isn't going onto the surface with the screws or you will recreate the same gap. Other than that 1 issue, I love the coffeemaker. It brews quickly. It does a great job with maintaining hot coffee (now)"
"December 27, 2018",Paul G,2.0,9,"What I liked: Dispensing one cup at a time and no carafe. What I disliked: As mentioned by many others, when setting for a delayed brew, often water would leak out from the water reservoir. At first we didn't notice it until the next morning when water was on the floor. Hardwood flooring in the kitchen and now it's ruined after all that water soaked in it. Tried calling Hamilton Beach support, recording said my hold time was about 20 minutes.  35 minutes later I finally hung up. Second time I called support, it said hold time was 30 minutes. Decided not to wait for what would likely be another 45 minutes or so. So I finally decided my time was worth more than waiting for support and getting frustrated.  Chalked up the $40 I paid for it to experience and got rid of it.  Bought a Mr. Coffee with a glass carafe this time for $30.  So far, great!  Coffee even tastes better. I would not recommend this product."
"August 21, 2016",kissesofhope26,5.0,18,"There are few things more depressing than loosing a beloved coffee maker, but that's what happened to us. Our old work horse started failing and we needed a new one. In comes this coffee maker to completely resurrect us from the dulldrums left by our former, caffeine-wielding friend. The setup was super quick and easy and off we were. The lack of coffee urn is a HUGE plus and the fact that water reservoir is removable makes the clean freak in me jump for joy. How was the first pot of coffee, you ask? Fan-freaking-tastic!! The coffee was hotter than our previous maker that supposedly had a setting to make it hotter."
"August 30, 2019",Mariam,1.0,6,"Very disappointed in the coffee maker. The first month it was great, then I noticed a small leak from the bottom. The leak worsened and now I have to keep a dish towel under it to avoid staining my countertop. Rather than the leak, the features are wonderful. It was exactly the style I wanted. I had this style before just a different brand and it lasted over 5 years. I expected this brand to be just as good. Would not recommend buying this one. Too late or I would return it as ineffective product."
"November 22, 2019",DoItYourSelfer,2.0,2,"Really wanted to like this coffee maker.  My Cuisinart Brew Central (owned two over 10 years) bit the dust after 5 years and I wanted to try something new.  I really liked the idea of the internal storage with the above cup dispenser but in reality, it just doesn't work on so many levels. I'm not really sure Hamilton Beach even really tested this design out in real-life scenarios. For example, placing it on a kitchen countertop with overhead cabinets. Lifting the lid to remove the internal storage requires lots of headroom. This lid is the full depth of the maker. Add that to the height means pulling it out from under the cabinets every time you need to fill it. Which in and of itself isn't that big a deal but the shape of the lid and it's length accrue a lot of condensate so that when you lift it all that water drips down the lid and most of the time all over the counter.  Cuisinart's lid, by comparison, was designed to catch that condensate upon lifting and direct it back into the fill tank. This does not. My second gripe with this is filling the tank. Due to the design you've got about 1.5"" x 3"" area to pour into on either the left or right side. The heater element takes up the middle and if you pour on that it splashes. Not a lot of room for error. Especially if you use the removable fill tank to do so. It lacks accuracy. Next on my list is the pour. Two things wrong here. As others have stated, it's finicky. Some days coffee comes right out and into your cup. Others, it's half in the cup, half down the front of the maker. There's no reason for this. Just poor design. Had they moved the spout an inch forward the coffee would flow into your cup. But since the fill valve is less than half an inch from the back of the brewer, surface tension allows it to stick to the underside and flow backwards and down the wall instead of your cup. This same poor design also the cause of other complaints, filling travel mugs. Because the fill valve is so far back you can't see it fill your travel mug. It's your best guess as to when your cup will overflow. Had the valve been more forward, you'd be able to see it fill the cup. Instead, your entire cup is covered by the brewer and you can't see in. Next fault is the tank where your brewed coffee is stored waiting for you to pour into your cup or down the coffee maker, whatever it feels like doing that day.  The tank itself is impossible to clean. While brew basket is dishwasher safe, the tank has to be hand-washed which is impossible to do. It's full of protrusions, sharp corners and crevices that can not be reached. The second thing wrong with it is that it leaves about half a cup of coffee in it once you dispense it. The bottom is flat and covers about 30sq inches of surface area. That leaves a lot of coffee to pool up that can't reach the pour valve.  All the designers had to do is angle the bottom about half degree forward and the final 3 ounces would flow right into the valve. Instead, you have to pick up and lean the entire coffee maker forward to get the last of the coffee out. Coffee shouldn't be this complicated. The good thing I can say is, it makes good coffee. Provided it get's into my cup."
"March 1, 2020",J,4.0,2,"I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I wanted a coffee maker just for fun. Something that wasn't too expensive, too complex, or defective. This was exactly what I was looking for. This coffee maker was fairly easy to use. After everything else is set up, most of the time, I just press one button. There's a legend on the side that tells you how many cups of liquid are in the reservoir (but note that these are teacups, not 8-fl-oz-cups). The one time I poured water into the coffee compartment (as opposed to the plain water compartment), the machine told me that it needed water. No surprises or glitches. After over 4 years of light use, this machine still works. Easy enough to clean. I make sure to use cold water to cool down the really hot components before wiping with a sponge. Those are a couple of metal rectangular pieces that are obviously used to heat water--the handles never get hot. Other than that, it's pretty straightforward. This coffee maker feels like a cheap Fisher Price coffee maker, but for the price, and for occasional use, it wasn't bad."
"November 25, 2020",Bear,2.0,One,"Bought on Sept 17th and thought, this is great, no more carafe to worry about breaking, easy to clean, simple set up, easy to use. And it was, until Nov 23rd when I went about my normal routine of brewing a pot and got my first cup, finishing it and going to refill it when I find coffee all over the floor and the cart I have the brewer on. I immediately believe it must be the little lever action piece you press on to fill the cup, since it's already emptied all but one of the twelve cups onto my floor, I bring it to the sink and investigate what could have gone wrong. Wasn't the fill lever, turns out it's the seal of the heating element inside the reservoir that gave out. I don't know about you, but I'm not going to spend another 20$ on a food-safe, heat resistant epoxy to fix something that's 3 months old (2 months out of return window) when I can spend a little more on the same coffee maker I replaced that lasted 9 years and was actually still working, but this one just seemed like a nice upgrade. I got a Mr. Coffee from Walmart to replace this, was 15$ less and will, if it'll be like the last one I replaced, last me at least a decade. Save the extra money and put it towards good coffee."
"October 11, 2019",W. JENSEN,5.0,2,"This is our second Hamilton Beach coffee maker, Our first was an older version of this design that worked for a year or so. Over time the dispenser got slower and slower, so human nature forces you to push harder on the dispensing lever that allows the coffee to come out. Well eventually it broke so we needed a new coffee maker. I am an all the time coffee drinker, my wife not so much these days. So this style with no pot to lug around and mess with works good for me, just go to the coffee station and get your coffee cup or travel mug filled and go. The level sight window is readable on this version so you know how much coffee is left and programing for morning brew is easy along with the auto cut off time setting and brew strength settings. (not that we use it) If you don't like messing with a coffee pot this works good, 12 cups is nice if you drink alot of coffee. We've had this one now for a few months, no issues. Just keep it clean with a vinegar and water solution or some other coffee maker cleaner and it should be fine. For how long? That would depend on your usage. With my experience with coffee makers, and we have gone through a bunch over the years. For the price on Amazon and free delivery this is not a bad deal for this model, Hamilton Beach really improved this style coffee maker from there last one. Good Job! There is not to many making this design with this capacity. And as a bonus, you can get a 4 year replacement warranty for just a few bucks more. We like it!"
"December 7, 2015",JoeRass,4.0,14,"We haven't had the machine for very long, but so far we really like it. We haven't had any problems with it except I did have the same issue as several others with 'pour water'; I have discovered how to eliminate that warning, at least for me. Turns out it's a user issue, not a machine issue. This machine has two heating functions, brewing and keeping the reservoir hot. These two functions are operated by the same button; the on-off button. The machine starts by heating the water to brew the coffee, which goes into the coffee tank, which has its own heater. When brewing is finished, the water heating part shuts down and the coffee tank heater remains on until it times out or the machine is shut off. So, when the machine times out and there's still coffee in the tank, we want to keep it warm and/or reheat it. So we push the on-off button and walk away, like we have with all our previous coffeemakers.  Then we hear the 'pour water' alarm and begin searching for a solution for this 'defect' as I did. However, on this coffeemaker, we just told it to make more coffee and it tells us not unless we give it some water to heat so the heating coil isn't damaged. We want the coffee to reheat or keep warm and where's the button for that?  I kick myself for not reading the instructions thoroughly, I mean how hard is it to operate a coffeemaker? The instructions say ""To reheat coffee, PRESS AND HOLD the on-off button for 3 SECONDS...""  (all caps are mine) this bypasses brewing and turns the tank heater on with the time reset. I haven't heard from 'pour water' since doing that. The four stars are because with all the internet questions about this, Hamilton Beach or Amazon should have pointed this out. AND I think they should incorporate a water filter like our old machine had. It was just a plastic ring that set on the brew basket which held a replaceable filter. We kept ours and are using it on this coffeemaker. Done for now"
"March 24, 2017",Patti F.,5.0,10,After going through several traditional coffee makers having the heating element die after a short time we decided to try this model.  I liked the idea of not having a carafe sitting on a heating element for several hours and instead being able to dispense coffee by pushing the mug against the lever.  So far I'm very happy with this purchase! I like that there are multiple options for how long to keep the coffee warm.  Most pots default to 1-2 hours which isn't long enough for me.  The coffee tastes great and the dispenser is convenient. My only knock might be that you have to take the filter basket out and put it somewhere in order to pull out the water tank to empty or fill it. I'd prefer to be able to pull out the whole thing and bring it to the sink as one unit before separating to empty and clean. Also a big improvement would be to be able to see how much time has elapsed or is left on the keep warm cycle so that you know if it's close or not. Preferable to going to get another cup only to find out it has turned off while you were doing something else.  I'd also like it if there was a light for the dispenser so that you could see how full the cup is getting.
"July 3, 2020",Justin D Holcomb,5.0,One,"First-Nearly 6- years Ago I purchased the less expensive model of this coffee maker--- I really Liked it except for the water that kept dripping on the counter from the steam and condensation trapped by the lid and getting returned to the inside missing the dispensing reservoir. because the cheaper model has the side reservoir there was now way to capture the stuff that dripped at the hinge from the condensation especially if the coffee was ""kept warm""----1-1.5 years on the Less Expensive model before I replaced it with something else. Now 3.5 Years on this model and it finally has to be replaced.. But i Still Love it and am replacing it with the same model. ---here is the details .... Average of 2 pots of coffee a day  made with this coffee maker, With the Keep Warm set at the 4 Hours. Often used the Brew timer for the first batch. I Love This Coffee maker and am ordering my second one as the first one finally started leaking out of the bottom of the reservoir. unlike it's cheaper brother all of the steam and residue from brewing and keep warm are returned back into the reservoir and not on the counter. My favorite feature is the dispensing but I also really like the cold brew option."
"July 14, 2021",Bon Vivant,2.0,,"Our last Hamilton Beach BrewStation worked beautifully for about five years, and then suddenly died.  Fine - that's not TOO bad in today's built-in-obsolescence consumer goods market. I really love the dispensing feature rather than having a carafe or glass pot, which is why I bought our first model.  When it died, I wanted to replace it with the exact HB model, which we did (despite my wife's opposition!)  The new one arrived, looked identical but: It leaks.  It leaks coffee from the dispenser.  It leaks with EVERY cup/mug filling - BEHIND the mug, and down the coffee dispenser bar.  Just a dribble, but - it LEAKS.  We've tried everything, but - it's clear that the newer version's coffee tank lever is NOT the same - and as others here have noted: it LEAKS. As a test, we put our old coffee tank on the new machine and: NO leaks.  We returned the new tank to the unit and: COFFEE LEAKS WITH EVERY MUG DISPENSED. Could we just continue to use our old tank with the new machine?  Yes, but why should we HAVE to?  We bought a new BrewStation, and I expect a properly-functioning unit, as I've paid for. This one is being RETURNED - and it's clear not only from our experience but from reading the comments of others here - that Hamilton Beach blew it - and if you DON'T (as we do) have an older model's tank, you'll have a leaking dispenser.  Unfortunately, we'll have to continue shopping for a different coffee maker, and after this experience, Hamilton Beach is OFF our shopping list.  Not only for coffee makers, but for any OTHER appliances."
"November 8, 2015",Jeff,1.0,16,"This thing was delivered in Sept. It is now November, and it is useless! I have kept it clean per instructions using a vinegar, and water solution. After about a month, a ""clean"" prompt will appear. I always rinsed it out with soapy water after each use. The problem happened after i set it to brew the next morning, but the coffee wasn't ready when I got up. I checked to make sure everything was right, and turned the machine on. It started making noise, like it was brewing, but then it just beeps and says ""pour water"" even though the reservoir had plenty of water in it. Then I noticed that it will not pump water from the bottom up to the tank where the coffee is. That is what causes the ""pour water"" prompt. Coffee grounds were barely wet. I've used the coffee maker every day since it was delivered, and have read all the instructions so no tutorials, please! I know how to use it, and I was very happy with it up until it wouldn't brew coffee anymore. Less than 2 months for $40.00? Very disappointed with this product! Will never buy another Hamilton Beach coffee maker, or anything else. I guess I'll just go back to a regular coffee maker that will at least last a couple years."
"July 6, 2020",Carol Jo,1.0,2,"I’ve bought cheaper coffee makers that are better. The dispenser leaks down the back when I press the button to get my coffee. And the only trouble shoot suggestion says that this happens when it’s got a clog from grounds. So, even though it’s brand new, we followed the instructions to clean it, but it just keeps doing it. I’m not sure if this is faulty or just what happens when you buy a coffee-dispensing maker rather than one with a carafe. I’m pretty disappointed because I’d been so excited about getting this coffee maker! Otherwise, the coffee stays piping hot the whole amount of time I set it to (4 hours) and it is easy to use and program. I just wish it didn’t make a giant mess."
"February 21, 2021",Paul Chadwick,1.0,,"Update: It became completely unusable about four months after purchase. Shuts down and goes dark with only a cup or two brewed from 12-cup setup. Won't start again until several hours later when it lights up and pretends to be normal until the next time you try to brew. I had to resurrect my old Black & Decker machine from the garage. It still works after over three years and the one thing that irritated me, extended time and steaming before shutting off at end of brew cycle, doesn't seem so important to me any more. ********* I like this coffeemaker. It's not the easiest to use because the brewed coffee reservoir is a bit awkward in shape, especially when being used to measure fresh water into the lower reservoir. But the heating feature is nice, and also the fact that you can start dispensing coffee into cups easily before the complete brew cycle is completed. There is one irritating design defect, however. It has taken me a while to figure out why it happens, but in every cycle the machine always leaks a bit of brewed coffee onto the surface on which it sits, making a mess and staining the grout lines in my tile countertop. After a few tests, it appears to me that the activating mechanism for the dispensing valve allows small amounts of coffee to run back along the activating lever and then down into the interior space of the machine and out the bottom of the case. I think I know a way to fix this by gluing a flexible plastic or silicone membrane in the path of the activating lever in order to prevent coffee from flowing down into the case. I haven't had time to try this yet, but plan to do so in the next few days and will update this review if it works. Update, April 21,2021: OK. So I pasted in the little piece of adhesive-backed 1/16"" thick silicone membrane, and that stopped the leaking of coffee down inside the case of the machine, but it still tends to dribble a few drops over the back edge of the cup almost every time when dispensing. So, need to wipe the cup to keep it from staining counter, my desktop, etc. But today when I tried to brew coffee the machine refused to brew. Display when dark, and the time display reset to midnight. After a while the display came back on. I reset the time and tried to brew, but it went dark again and wouldn't heat. Suspiciously, the time setting has reset itself to midnight a couple times in the past two weeks, as if there had been a power outage, but there wasn't. Those times, I reset the time and coffee brewed normally. Today I couldn't get it to brew at all. The machine has never displayed the ""CLEAN"" message as the manual indicted it should, but I suspect that may be the problem. The display turned on again, so I'm cleaning it now with vinegar as instructed. Hoping for the best."
"March 15, 2021",Quackstar,2.0,,"I wanted to love this coffee maker, but after almost two years and numerous annoyances I am finally calling it quits and in the market for a new one.  I was really excited about the prospect of not having a carafe to clean/break, and about the coffee reservoir to keep it warm rather than sizzling on the burner.  I love that I can put my travel mug right on the dispenser button and fill it that way rather than pouring it in. But the reality of this machine is far from perfect.  I recognize that I'm a bit clumsy, but I dump or drip water trying to fill the reservoir every day. I had several issues with leaks, and Hamilton Beach did replace a portion of the machine for me which helped the issue... for awhile.  Their customer service also kindly helped me troubleshoot when the machine was leaking again (differently) and clogging and dripping all over, and I learned how to clean it in a way that helped... for awhile.  But then I couldn't even blame the machine anymore because I gave up on the regular cleaning (fill with vinegar, let sit, rinse, run cycles with just water, repeat, repeat...) because it was such a chore.  All in all I just dealt with it like a somewhat faulty but still functional appliance for a long time and now I'm ready to have something that is less work.  It makes decent coffee.  But I'm sure there are other things out there that do that with less hassle!"
"February 24, 2021",Robert M.,3.0,,"My carafe-less Cuisinart ""on-demand"" 12 cup died & has been discontinued <tears>.  I had three over the last decade.  I took a chance on this Hamilton Beach 48465 because too many glass carafes had been broken on previous coffeemakers (at a replacement cost of around $25 each, which is unconscionable).  Water goes in the base on this unit & the ""tank"" has a spout on it for filling the base. The good:  Makes good coffee in about 12 minutes (for 10 cups).  Has a setting for 1-4 cups, bold setting, 1-4 hours hold time, brew timer & clock. The bad:  It has only 2 silicone feet (attached at the rear) and if you push the unit around on a counter, they can come loose.  The dispenser valve is spring loaded, so you push your cup against an activator bar and coffee flows into your cup.  Sadly, it also can flow down the stainless front trim and into the ""Drip tray,"" which is way undersized and can easily overflow onto your counter--and under the unit.  A little more thought should have been put into the dispenser valve.  The other niggle is a lack of an LED ""headlight"", so you can see the level in your mug. This is less of a problem if you have a light colored mug.  Mine are dark, so I've used a flashlight to see the level. For the price, I can live with the design flaws."
"December 30, 2019",M. Daguerre,1.0,One,"Made good coffee for a while, then suddenly began making significantly less coffee than the added water and would never stop steaming and sputtering. It appears that the part that is a valve that shuts off the flow of water when the coffee chamber lid is lifted (and which also nestles into a socket in that lid) has developed a leak, such that water and steam burst out onto the surrounding plastic, where it dribbles down between the interior wall of the unit and the exterior wall of the coffee chamber back into the water reservoir. This creates an endless loop where brewing never stops as there is a constant replenishment of water into the reservoir. I tested this by exhaustively cleaning the unit with 3 gallons of water (which removed all stains) and looking into the reservoir at 15 minute intervals to make sure that a small puddle of water was always there. I examined the rubber part from which the steam and water burst every few seconds. It's very soft, and I don't know what it was like before the leaks started. All plastic surfaces are free of any mineral deposits from water. Judging from the high number of reviews with the ""constantly-brewing why-don't-I-have-all-my-cups"" issue, this is a common problem, perhaps not by percentage but certainly by absolute number of cases. You can observe the leaking and how it spreads water and condensation and sends it down the spout/chute into the reservoir."
"December 7, 2018",Tanman,3.0,3,"I looked up our orders for HB Brewstations from Amazon.

Purchased this item(model 47950) on 9/11/2016.It developed the worn out spring issue that many people have to the point where it was hard to get coffee into the cup.Never did have the leak problem other people had although perhaps the other model did. Purchased this item again on 12/02/2018 this time with an extended warranty-I'm pretty sure it wasn't offered on the 2016 purchase.It's funny how the square trade warranties appear and disappear and change price all within 15 minutes.Anyways if they are offering a 3-4-5 year warranty in the buck 1.25 to 1.50 range per year I would get it. So you may wonder why would we buy a coffee maker that only lasts 2 years? We like the removable water reservoir-much easier to fill in the sink without having to use the hose. We are not coffee fanatics-regular Maxwell House(horrors) works fine for us and the brew tastes good.Holds a good temperature for hours with no burnt taste. Easy to clean-just dump the grounds and any left over coffee,a little soap and water and you are done.We usually give the metal heating plate in the coffee reservoir a little scrub if it's brown. 2 minor design flaws that it would be nice to see fixed(beyond the non repairable spring wearing out) are 1)It would be nice if somehow the remaining coffee level indicator was more in the front-it can be difficult to see on the side and 2)wish the water reservoir stood straight instead of there being a gap.Minor quibbles. 2 things we have noticed about the new machine.  The old one made some typical brewing noise when brewing but the noises stopped once the water was out of the reservoir.This one keeps burbling away for a while.Not sure if this is related but it appears to make about 2/3 rds of a cup less coffee.We pretty much follow the same routine so I immediately noticed when my usual 3rd cup filled only 1/3rd of the way.Many times there was coffee left over.Will definitely keep an eye on that issue."
"January 24, 2021",Richard Jacobs,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker. I am not a fan of the K cup coffee, (it is little more than instant coffee as far as I'm concerned), but I do like that this coffee maker dispenses coffee directly into the cup. I have had four coffee dispensers but this one and the one I had prior are the best because they have a detachable cistern for the water, avoiding having to pour the water into the maker, thus avoiding spilled water. Now, the only thing I do not like about this coffee maker is the small filter over the dispenser port is not removable which makes the filter itself  and the dispenser port difficult to clean, (hence, four stars instead of five for ease of cleaning). It is a minor thing but the inability to remove the filter was why I had to replace the old coffee maker. It developed a leak, a small one but still a nuisance. I suspected that either there was something blocking the port for closing completely or the gasket needed replacing. However, because of the permanent filter, I could not get into the port to check. The old one did last me over five years, and I have to admit, I often left coffee in the cistern overnight, which means I did not clean it as often as I should have, so I bear some of the blame for the dispenser port leaking. Anyway, if you like to be able to dispense coffee directly into the cup but find K cups tasteless like I do, I highly recommend this coffee maker. A great cup of coffee every time, just clean it every week or so and it should last for a long time."
"March 1, 2020",Andrew Tomasin,5.0,One,"I bought this to replace my 10 year old Hamilton Beach brewstation, which was incredibly good and reliable for years until the seal around the drain started to leak slowly. So I was eager to purchase the latest generation of that product. So far, the machine has lived up to its promises. The side-mounted water tank is a great improvement over the old style, which used the same tank for both holding coffee and filling the reservoir. It also saves having to pour water into the reservoir. The dispenser fits my travel mug, unlike the old brewstation I had. The dispenser button is a very stiff, and I sometimes have to hold the back of the machine to get it to dispense. This may be due to it being brand new, we will see if this gets better with time. The machine makes noise as it keeps the coffee warm. This is a minor annoyance, but still weird, since my old brewstation was able to keep coffee warm without noise. I do like the settable ""keep warm hours"", while the old one was locked at 4 hours. Some people have complained about water pooling around the hot-plate, so far I have NOT seen this at all. Perhaps people don't have their machine on a level surface? I'm not sure how it even gets down there, since there is a drain port that drains condensation into the coffee reservoir. So far, I am very pleased with this machine, and will update if any issues arise."
"December 8, 2019",Cougsfan,1.0,One,"All in all, this is a appreciable improvement over my 10 year old Mr. Coffee.  It is easy to use , makes good coffee and I'd buy it again.  But it has a couple of features that could use improvement: 1) I had to go buy a white coffee cup because all mine were dark.  You cannot see when the cup is full with a dark cup.  A little light in the fill area would have been nice.  2) The gauge that shows how much coffee is left works fine when it is full, but is next to useless when there is less than 2 or so cups left.  3) condensate forms on the lid.  It then runs down the lid along the inside wall into a collection area below the finished coffee container.  If you don't clean it out that condensate can get pretty rank after a while, and it is a little harder than it should be to clean it  (I use a sponge to soak it out, takes a couple minutes to do) Update:  The unit has gotten progressively worse as I use it more.  The coffee is only lukewarm now when first brewed, and I dislike cool coffee. But the secondary heater soon over-heats the coffee, burns it and ruins the taste as it sets brewed for more than an hour or so.  In addition, the condensate problem has gotten much worse.  Even with serious cleaning after each use, the calcium build-up in the parts exterior of the coffee container are getting out of hand.  My old Mr. coffee lasted 10 years and still worked fine. This guy is going in the garbage after about a year."
"December 29, 2016",Mykah,5.0,7,"Our coffee pot went out and we were going store to store looking for one that fit what we had in a decent price range. We had our other coffee pot for so many years and I was surprised how difficult it was to locate a 12 cup reserved without a carafe that made more than a few cups. This coffee pot, especially for this price, exceeded my expectations! All the features that it can do and perform, it unbelievable and amazing!!! I am excited to play with it more! I love the 're-warm' feature, the extra reservoir, the ability to make iced coffee!! o.O I just can't believe all of these features for this price! I am a very happy consumer! My husband sets it to brew Bold and we love it, it's convenient and works very well. It does not get as 'hot' as my husband was like but he feels it's a great trade off. Oh, it is SUPER quiet! PAY ATTENTION when you're making a cup especially if you're using a dark coffee cup early in the morning, as you may spill!! I didn't know how much was in my cup as I didn't hear a thing. Oh so ultra quiet! Love it :D I definitely rather pay more attention over the noise of previous coffee pots. I can't say enough about this coffee pot, may seen a bit overboard, but if like coffee and tea like we do, you'll understand. We are not coffee connoisseurs, but we do like a good cup of joe."
"October 25, 2018",Big 'G',4.0,3,"I purchased this item on June 8, 2016. UPDATE: AS OF TODAY 3/5/2019... it works! I contacted Hamilton Beach via email and received a prompt response with an option to purchase a replacement tank. They don't sell just the plunger part. Anyhow, I'm back up and running with my daily coffee. I'll upgrade my stars to four. I do highly recommend taking apart your coffee tank and remove the plunger then place a few drops of super glue at each of the three joints. Before it breaks that is. I'll post pics of the plunger. UPDATE: AS OF TODAY 11/5/18... ITS BROKEN. The little plunger I talked about below... well, I tried cleaning it and just pressed up on to drain the water to make sure it was working properly and now it won't hold water/coffee. Lucky for me it did this while cleaning and not a with a whole tank full of coffee which would have emptied out on the counter and my hardwood floor. Worse yet... Hamilton Beach doesn't supply this part on their website. Also, their website is ancient. Sad for such a large company. Get with the program, please! Still, I liked their older version better. Hamilton pretty much took the old one and went backwards with it as far as design. Probably to cut cost. I use RO water in it only and clean it with RO water as well. This prolongs the life of the unit and it still works great. I like the idea of being able to pour my own cup right out of the dispenser. I like the timer feature as well. What I don't like is not being able to tell if there is one cup left or not. I have to tilt the whole unit sideways to see if any coffee is left or open the lid and lift up the strainer. A good tip in keeping the unit functioning properly is to use RO or distilled water and when finished brewing and emptying the container... dispose of your coffee grounds and fill the brew basin where the coffee is kept warm with hot water and sometimes sprinkle some baking soda in it. The will reduce the number of times of having to take the plunger apart to clean out the screen. If your coffee stops coming out in a steady stream that means your screen is clogged. Taking off the plunger and using an air compressor is easiest way to clean it. Oh, be sure and empty the baking soda water before making your next brew. Happy brewing!"
"May 14, 2020",Envy224,4.0,,"There are many things nice about this coffeemaker. I like that there is no glass coffee pot to break, it has a very small footprint. You can select regular or bold-flavored coffee (adding time to the brewing process). It can be programmed to start in the morning and to stay on for up to 4 hours keeping the coffee warm.  BUT you have to practically take it apart to make a pot (removing the basket and the coffee reservoir to add water). My biggest problem with this is the design of the dispenser.  I haven't yet figured out what is wrong with it, I think it is the 2 little ""wells"" on either side of the push pin.  Right out of the box, the first pot of coffee I made, coffee leaked out from behind the release button.  Not from the dispenser - it's clearly coming from under/behind the push bar.  There is a place to catch this overfill under the coffee cup, but it really shouldn't happen. It is a tad annoying and when this coffeemaker stops working (as they all do eventually) I won't replace it with the same model.  I will go back to the Cuisinart I'd had that lasted 15 years with no problems."
"July 1, 2021",Nicholas Rajotte,2.0,,"While the coffee tastes fine, like others have reviewed, this product simply isn't built to last.  I bought this in December 2019 and just got my new machine to replace this one in today so about a year and a half we got out of it. Some pros of the machine are the internal coffee storage that helps keep it fresh for longer and no glass carafe to worry about, but the coffee at the bottom always tastes burnt if its in the machine longer than an hour, ours would randomly leak from the bottom somewhere, leaving water all over the counter even with regular vinegar cleanings and only using filtered water in it. The tank is not dishwasher safe and the cup measure on the sides pretty much stay stained with coffee since its not really built with cleaning in mind so you got to kind of shake the machine a little or take a real close look to see how much coffee you have.  The last cup or two you have to tilt the machine to get the coffee out or it doesn't flow well and gets all over the place because its just going down the side of the cup and machine. If you want a simple coffee machine for a vacation home or 2nd home that looks like nice, this could work, but if you want an everyday workhorse I would stay away from this unit and go with something else."
"June 22, 2020",RailBirdJay,2.0,One,"I should have given more attention to the negative reviews. I received compliments on its look and it was cool with the dispenser (touch-less). However, unless you use a very small travel mug or standard coffee mug you will have to tilt your travel mug at an angle just right so that the button depresses. I could live with that but what I cannot live with is the leaking every day. It stores the coffee and keeps it warm in a resovoir which underneat is a dry compartment housing the heating element. It is in this ‘dry’ compartment that the coffee somehow leaks into it forcing you to spread all the removable compartments on the counter and turn the whole coffee maker upside down over the sink to pour out. Then you have to dry off the element etc. What a complete piece of junk. Good idea horrible engineering Hamilton Beach! After a months use I am buying a simple programmable coffee maker. I REALLY wanted to like this but I didn’t pay enough attention to other user’s experiences, I guess. Ugh 50$ down the drain."
"May 24, 2019",kmcintyre1,5.0,2,"Coffee maker came on time and as advertised, after the Mr. Coffee we had for seven years finally bought the farm. I wanted one similar to the Cuisinart 3000 coffee maker we have at work, but at a better price. So far, after close to a week, there’s much to love. Pros? It’s easy to program, unlike the Mr. Coffee, so there’s always fresh brewed coffee waiting in the morning. The directions were easy to follow, and after cleaning the coffee maker before the initial brew, the coffee has a great flavor, and each cup is hot. Not having a carafe is a plus. It shows how much coffee is brewed. It’s easy to disassemble to clean. Lots to love. Cons? It does slide when dispensing coffee, a simple fix with a nonskid rubber mat underneath. I haven’t had the problem with condensation, but I wipe my coffee maker out after each brew, and while the keep warm feature is great, two hours is sufficient to keep the coffee warm. We don’t drink coffee all day, just in the morning before work. Overall I’m pretty happy with this purchase, will let you know how durable later on"
"June 30, 2021",Steve G,1.0,,"First of all, please know that I'm a handyman who enjoys fixing things by nature. I fix small engines, vehicles, kitchen appliances, refrigerators, washer/dryers... etc. This coffee maker leaks from the rear of the machine, but why? The picture below is of the product with the bottom panel removed. While the water reservoir is full, it depresses a spring and allows water to flow through the orange tube to the heating coil. However, there is a silicone washer that is fitted between the basin and the fresh water manifold. With only two small screws holding this manifold in place, there isn't enough tension to create a water tight seal. Either larger screws or a larger silicone fitting is needed to prevent this leaking. But what makes it dangerous? The location from which the water was leaking (Circled in red) is directly above the power line (Circled in blue). I observed the water drip directly onto the power cord. What's worse, is the water was making contact at the wire nut, which has exposed wire in the center, where the water would seep. Dripping water onto a live electrical wire is dangerous. I would avoid this product at all costs."
"February 4, 2020",ck4him,3.0,2,"I was very excited about this coffee maker at first. It was the first time I had a programmable coffee maker and I loved the resorvoir. But I didn't think that through very well. Some reviewers reported that their coffee tasted like plastic. I, too, have noticed this. I wish I had thought it through before purchasing. I avoid plastic as much as possible. I use glass storage dishes and glass everything. Why would I put hot coffee in a plastic reservoir and then put that in my body? Also, as others have stated, the coffee isn't very hot unless it sits in there for a while. Several months ago, the coffee maker began to leak everywhere. Lesson learned. Listen to other reviewers before making a purchase. This coffee maker is a good idea but it needs some tweaking."
"May 6, 2019",Penny Newton,4.0,4,"This is our second Hamilton Beach coffee maker of this design. The first one was great to use, not easy to clean and extremely irritating to move around the kitchen counter. So why did we buy a second one? Because we loved the feature of no carafe (to drop and break or to have to wash separately) and dispensing is easy. We felt that Hamilton Beach would have improved on the design by clearing up the irritations, but there are no design improvements at all, apart from a slick new stainless steel type finish. The previous one had a black finish with a stainless steel type upper panel. To dispense coffee you press your cup against the dispensing bar and voila! out comes the coffee to fill your cup. The brew strength is adjustable, so with a bit of practice, you should get your perfect cup. But when you get to the end of the pot, the last 1/3 cup pours out down the fascia. Hence the drip tray. Cleaning is not as simple as it seems, as the filter basket quickly grows a layer of limescale around the top, from the wet paper coffee filter resting against the inner rim. Ideally you should remove the paper filter and rinse the filter basket once it has finished brewing, but who has time for that in the morning rush? So scrubbing with a descaler is the only option, as the dishwasher gets the whole basket clean except for the top rim. When you push your cup against the dispenser bar, you will find your unit moves back a little. Yes there are glide feet underneath, but the unit should stay where you put it on the counter. Those feet came off after the first use, so we replaced them with non slip feet, which makes the unit ""judder"" when you push it. Having the unit at the back of the counter will solve the pushing issue, but you still have to pull it forward to fill it and wash out the tank. Such tiny details make all the difference.  Come on Hamilton Beach, we're sold on this coffee maker, but the irritations persist."
"August 8, 2019",W.N.,3.0,,"After I woke up the other morning, I found my one cup coffee maker had died unexpectedly. Of course, I immediately hopped onto amazon to remedy my problem. I blame what came next on my caffeine-less state. On an impulse, I bought this coffee maker. First, it was shipped in its manufacturer box. There was no bubble wrap to protect it in transit. The box had a hole and beat up a bit. I was afraid the coffee maker wouldn’t work. However it did. I didn’t notice any plastic smell or taste, so that was great! But the coffee is a bit weak. I’m sure I need an adjustment period to figure out how much coffee to use. Really, my issue is my own fault. I read the dimensions and measured. I knew I would need to move my coffee mugs. I just didn’t realize how big it was. I’m short, very short barely five foot. I have to pull it out to fill it with water and load the coffee, but it’s so tall it’s just awkward when you’re almost eye level with the top. Also, this unit is really impractical for a two person household. We drink a lot of coffee, but at different times. I work from home and drink coffee until mid afternoon, so having it waiting seemed like a dream. It’s really a lot of effort to make a new pot. The drip tray is a cruel joke. If there’s ever a leak, it won’t catch a thing. It’s basically flimsy decor. The rest of the unit feels flimsy as well. I worry with daily movement and jarring, it’ll break. Maybe that’s why so many reviews mention leaks. It’s also loud. You won’t forget you have coffee. All in all, I love the idea of this coffee maker. It works like it’s supposed to so far. I already have buyers remorse, though. The bulk will be too much for me in the long run. I’ll keep it and save it for when I have company, but I think I’ll keep looking to solve my coffee issues. However if you have a large family,  over 5’4, and have a lot of space between your cabinets and counter, I would recommend this model. It’s just too much for me."
"July 5, 2021",Vtmom,5.0,One,"I got 2 of these, one to leave at our summer cottage and one to replace my brothers Cuisenart which is what we had been using at the cottage. We have been spending a lot of time there the last few months renovating the kitchen among other things to redo it for summer rentals. The month of June is for our family and we had 10-11 adults here at any given time so lots of coffee was being consumed. I set up both pots and always had one programmed to brew at 6:30am p, the other at various times but I always readied them both so the brew button could just be pushed and it worked like a charm. The 4 hr warm feature was perfect and brewing 3 or 4 rounds a day was a piece of cake! Relatives who came to visit went home and ordered one for themselves and one for their mom, my family from CA is talking about ordering one as well. We decided to leave both pots at the cottage for our renters as well as us next year and I will be ordering a third to replace my brothers. I can’t say enough about how great these have been so far."
"October 30, 2016",Kilo,3.0,12,"This coffee machine seems to work fine, most of my issues are with The design. If I'd been able to see how it worked I probably would not have purchased it.  The way it works you have to open the lid and remove a small plastic bucket that holds the coffee filter, then take the large bucket on the top off, fill it with water, then pour that into the base of the machine. This isn't very easy to do. The heating element is then inside of the top bucket, which is made of plastic. Heating plastic that your coffee is sitting in all day doesn't strike me as a great idea. I had also picked this one because the description said it was BPA free, however I don't see anything on the box indicating that, so in skeptical of that claim. Cool idea to dispense coffee, but awkward execution of the design."
"May 19, 2021",Leo Lowenthal,5.0,,"My cleaning person recently broke my Mr. Coffee carafe, so I suddenly got into the market for a new one. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to replace it with one that met my needs, I decided to pay a little more than I had planned, and so bought this Hamilton Beach. One of the reasons I decided on it was that it didn't have a carafe to break... that and the fact that I would often forget to put the carafe back when making coffee, making many messes. Now you have to understand that I am a very critical consumer, hence the two previous attempts to replace my old maker, and that because I expect products to work and to be easy to use, I don't frequently write reviews, unless the product is horrible or is beyond expectation. The Hamilton Beach certainly ended up being the latter. It is very easy to understand to use, and because it doesn't have a carafe, the overflowing issue is a thing of the past. I would HIGHLY recommend it! In fact, I am so pleased that if I could I would give it six stars!"
"June 11, 2021",Blackbird,2.0,,"First, understand that neither my husband nor myself feel we can lift a carafe without risking it falling, otherwise we'd never have bought it. However, since we had to choose this type this is now the 4th of this specific coffee maker and I'm done wasting money. Because we both drink coffee and we prefer different strengths, we each have our own. So this is my second review in a few years. Of the first two we purchased, 1 lasted less than a year (mine) until it just quit. His lasted a couple years but eventually took nearly half an hour to fix a 12 cup pot. So we bought this ""new and improved"" chrome looking thing. It leaks from a broken seal if you try to put more than 6 cups of water in the tank. The first time he tried to make a full pot of coffee there was water everywhere. Fortunately he still had the tank from the old one. Now my old (3rd) one keeps telling me it needs cleaned and the coffee has become bitter. I'm done. Absolutely, positively done. Take it from the idiot. Save your money and buy something else."
"April 14, 2016",Susie,1.0,13,"It has been a long time since I have been so disappointed in a product.  I""ll cut to the chase:  1)  The plastic is flimsy, and the coffeemaker is so lightweight that when you push the button to dispense the coffee, the whole thing slides on the counter (even with the rubber stoppers inserted on the bottom--maybe because my counter is granite, idk).  2)  It is so difficult to see the coffee when it is dispensing, so you have to bend down to make sure you don't overflow the cup (maybe because I'm 5'9"" idk).  3)  MY TOP COMPLAINT--if you set the ""keep warm"" setting, you will hear your coffee BOILING, for hours.  Not only does this make the coffee taste bitter, but it is way too hot to drink once you dispense it.  Anyway, I wanted to return it, but missed the window.  I spent the money and purchased a Cuisinart Coffee on Demand ($100) and it is worth every penny!"
"February 28, 2019",Lady of the Lake,3.0,2,"I love the idea of this coffee pot.  I used to buy an earlier version regularly....love the on demand feature...but they always leaked.  I went back to standard glass carafe models but really prefer this style, so I tried it again.  Good news....no water leaking all over the counter!!  However, within days of first use, the steam possibly, or just the water dripping during rinsing, caused the lettering to all but disappear ( I see someone had the same problem and posted a picture of the disappearing letters) I cleaned off the remaining letters and had a nice, shiny looking coffee maker!!  I like the carafe for water, easy to fill, but if you have to set it down and walk away it is very tippy.  One of those times it spilled, no problem, it was in the sink, but it broke the hooks that kept the lid on.  Alright, I am dealing with that.  But now the coffee maker uses differing amounts of water each time we make coffee.  There may be a dribble left in the carafe, or an inch or more, this morning it was all used.  My first coffee maker arrived broken inside the box, the replacement came quickly but I have only been using this coffee maker for 4 months.  I guess we will be switching to Cuisinart.  I am sorry about that because this makes good coffee. I hope you folks at Hamilton Beach are reading these reviews, most of us, it seems, really like the product in theory, please, take it to the next level, I want to be able to brag about how my amazing coffee maker not only makes great coffee but is still with me, years....not just months, later!!"
"September 6, 2020",Barbara Wojtanoski,5.0,One,"l bought this coffee  pot in Nov.2019. In less than a week I found water on my counter !! thought I spilled water while filling it. ok so I wiped it up later went to get another cup of coffee it filled my cup but the coffee was all gone!!!! I made 12 cups  and was only my 2nd cup,What the heck!!!! I noticed coffee around the edge of the coffee maker I pulled it out AND THERE IS coffee ALL over the counter. I unplugged it took the basket & the part the holds the coffee and under it all was filled with coffee  well that same day it shorted  out. Many other people reported this same thing,I WILL READ ALL the reviews of products before I buy it. Hamilton Beach I so ashamed of you knowing that this product was defective and DIDN'T put out a recalls . It could have caught my house on fire. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS NOT SAFE."
"January 22, 2020",JohnG,1.0,One,"We've had several of this model coffee maker for over 13 years, and we' like the design and functionality.  We like it so well that we ordered another one to have one in our new motor home.  When the new one came, we thought we'd use it in the house and rotate the older one to the motor home.  But the first few times we used it, it would leak coffee down the front below the outlet, running down the side of the cup being filled, eventually filling the drip tray and finally running onto the counter.  Okay, maybe a defective unit, so we returned it to Amazon and got a replacement. But the latest replacement had the same dripping problem!  So we reruned it and will try a different style coffee maker.  Can no longer recommend this one!"
"December 22, 2019",Ayla Harrison,1.0,One,"Ok... So the whole reason this thing is only getting a 1 star review over all for me is because the coffee isn’t hot!!! The reservoir was very hot to the touch which makes you think the coffee would be too, but it’s not at all. A freshly brewed cup of coffee was so Luke warm I could stick a finger in it no problem. Then factor in if you use liquid creamer and you definitely have to stick it in the microwave to heat it up. No thank you, my coffee should be so hot when it comes out that I have to let it cool for a minute OR that it’s perfect by the time I put my liquid creamer in. (And yes I tried it without the liquid creamer too) to make sure that wasn’t the problem. We thought about just keeping it anyway but had also read reviews about it leaking if you have it preset to turn on at a certain time and we didn’t want to risk that. It also slides backwards when you try to dispense coffee. Like it needs better grips on the bottom or something. The dispensary button was stiff and didn’t work very well... We sent it back defective and bought a kureig. I was super sad this didn’t work well because we have friends who have one very similar and love it and we love it when we go visits them. I was so excited to have one like it. But this was a huge let down. Sent back after only a couple of days."
"December 10, 2019",Emilie Thomas,2.0,,"Update 6/3: Our coffee maker, while amazing when working properly, sprung a leak after 4 months of ownership. When making coffee it would leak through the base and covered our cabinets and floors. I contacted Hamilton Beach customer service since our product was still under the 1 year warranty. On May 7th I received notification they were shipping a replacement free of charge. On 6/2 I reached back out asking for a status update since we had still not received our replacement unit and was told that it was on back order. Instead, I was given the option to find a replacement on their websites that was under $29.99 despite this model retailing for $46.99 on their site. I originally was impressed with their prompt customer service, but this “option” is laughable. Instead I have been out of a coffee maker for over a month and given no help to replace it. Very disappointed in Hamilton Beach and will unlikely purchase their products again in the future. I absolutely love this machine. The reason I chose this one over others was the cold brew option. I love the fact that I can brew the coffee and make myself a cup while getting ready and the remainder stays fresh and hot for when my SO wakes up. My only complaint is that it is quite tall so if you store it on a countertop with overhead cabinets you may not be able to open the lid. We instead created a dedicated “coffee bar” and it’s been perfect!"
"March 2, 2021",Bookbabe,1.0,,"I’ve had four or five of these brew stations over the years. I really like the concept of not having to deal with a glass carafe, since I have dexterity problems and have shattered many a carafe first thing in the morning. However, I’m sorry to say that the quality has gone downhill steadily, and I will not buy another after this one expires. I have three issues: 1. The bottom of the machine has two little silicone feet that are inserted into holes in the bottom of the tank. They are there to ensure that the machine does not slide backwards as you depress your coffee mug into the dispenser on the front. They really serve a necessary function; otherwise your brew station will run away from you as you attempt to dispense your precious coffee.  However, in the most recent versions of the brew station, they are just stuck into these holes at the bottom of the tank, and they come loose and inevitably lost within the first week of usage. I’ve even tried super gluing them in place, all to no avail. Surely the manufacture could’ve designed this differently. 2.  Inside the tank is a little dome shape filter that used to be removable in earlier Brewmaster versions.  It really needs to be cleaned when you clean the pot, as it collects a black residue that gives your coffee a nasty taste. The manufacture has now designed it so that this filter is not removable. When I deconstructed my previous brewmaster, I found that the inaccessible underneath part of the filter was completely black, even though the accessible, outward facing part of the filter was nice and shiny and clean. No wonder my coffee was tasting nasty! The manufacturer really missed an opportunity here. Instead of permanently afixing that filter, if they just would’ve sold the filter as a replacement part, I would’ve definitely been a customer. 3.  Worst of all, coffee dribbles and leaks when you press the dispenser. Every morning my counter is stained. I’m going to have to find another way to get my magic morning elixir. A great product was reengineered and ruined!"
"July 24, 2019",Stephanie Hudson,5.0,,"I usually go through a coffee pot every 2 years, and like clock work, I found myself in need of a coffee pot. This time I decided I wanted something that is easy to clean. With other coffee pots, the water reservoir gets downright disgusting. This one has removable everything making for easy cleaning. The removable water reservoir makes it really nice and easy to add water. I have problems with balance and tremors, so pouring a carafe full of water and then emptying has been a constant mess. I have learned  to adjust for it, but this makes it perfect. I like all of the buttons and options, but the one thing I truly appreciate is the bright lights. I didn't realize this was a feature I would like, but I will never be without it again. The coffee tasted fresh from the first cup to the last. Downsides? Only a couple but not enough to make me lower the rating. It is more a wait a see type thing. 1. It makes noise. Almost the entire time the coffee pot is on, there is some sort of noise coming from it. Like water on the element - a constant sizzle. 2. It is a bit difficult to see how full the coffee cup is if you aren't above the level of the cup. I will purchase some clear cups. That is about it. I will add to the review if anything changes. Great product with a lot of nice bells and whistles without a steep price tag."
"January 9, 2021",L. Boyter,5.0,,"We love this coffee maker! We purchased it after my husband broke the glass carafe on our Mr. Coffee for the second time. I looked into ones with a thermal, stainless steel coffee pot thinking he couldn't possibly break it but they were too expensive. I found this one and loved the idea of no carafe at all and being able to press your mug against a button and have coffee come out.  I was very surprised at how inexpensive it was so I bought it. I do have to say it leaked like crazy. We loved the functionality of it but not the leaking which we figured was not the norm. I emailed Hamilton Beach and they sent us a second one and they paid for shipping. Plus, they said we could keep the first one. This one leaks a tiny bit but nothing like the first and because we love how this coffee maker operates and their great customer service I am giving this 5 starts. For the price, you can't beat this coffee maker and the coffee reservoir is so much easier to clean then a glass carafe that gets stained. It keeps the coffee hot for hours too!  I highly recommend this!"
"April 3, 2021",Tony Z,5.0,,I had Hamilton Beach Flex brew for a couple years. It worked well till one morning I noticed there was a message where the clock is that said that it needed cleaned. I cleaned it well and reset the clock. A week later the message came up again. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. The message disappeared till the next week. I made coffee that morning and noticed it was leaking really bad. I learned the hard way and always keep a serving tray underneath. I threw it right in the trash. I decided to order the brew station because I thought it would be easier not lifting the pot. The flex brew had a steel carafe which was heavy when it was full. So far it is working great. I really like how it comes apart to clean. I also like that the heat timer can be adjusted from 0 to 4 hours. So far no leaks. I’m buying a little Keurig so we can also use k- cups. So far I’m happy.
"April 5, 2020",CFrieberg,2.0,,"We purchased this type because the concept of a brew station without a carafe and a dispenser button was intriguing.  However, as with all coffeemakers that we have ever purchased, this one is loaded with disappointment. ""12 cups"" is not actually 12 cups.  The actual capacity of the reservoir is only 64 oz. (8 true cups). So beware if you are looking to brew an actual 12 cup pot. The more disconcerting issue though, is that the unit leaks. When we woke up, more than half the reservoir was missing water, and it was all over the counter.  We cannot find where the leak is coming from, but after every brew cycle, we find a puddle of water beneath the unit.  I put a towel under it for now, but I will be on the lookout for yet another model.  Why is it so difficult for consumers to purchase a product that is not falsely advertised and actually WORKS?!"
"June 1, 2021",T. V.,3.0,,"Had a previous model for 15 years that finally passed away.  Got this as a replacement. Why, oh why, do good things get changed? Ok, when filling with water, the carafe you carry to your sink, you must place your palm and finger over the holes in the bottom as you carry it to the coffee maker, then you must pour the water into the machine reservoir VERY slowly!  Any thought to pour it at a reasonable speed will be thwarted by water spilling out.  Keep in mind you had better have those two little holes STILL covered or...water all over.  After you believe you have emptied all water from the carafe, you are mistaken as you have to position the carafe above the machine BEFORE uncovering those holes as when you quickly move your hand water will pour from those holes, so hopefully you’ve aligned yourself over the machine so that the water goes into the machine reservoir.  Now, you take your old reusable coffee filter and find it sure doesn’t fit therefore you have to trim down the plastic so it fits (one time problem fixed).  NOW, coffee is made and you’re ready to enjoy when you find your cup doesn’t fit...ok so you put your cup at an angle push in the button with your thumb then scream in pain because even though all the coffee IS making it into your cup somehow it’s also coming out of the push button RIGHT on your thumb.  But you REALLY want that flipping cup of coffee so you scream through the pain because you’re tough dang it!  Now, you have your coffee, the machine will keep the other half warm for the next 4 hours and you sit to enjoy the coffee as you administer burn treatment to your thumb.  Now, your husband may have drank the other half, maybe you got to it first, doesn’t matter, NOW it’s time to clean a strange explosion of coffee grounds that somehow exploded on the flip lid.  You grab a paper towel, wipe it off and watch it fall into the machine reservoir.  It’s ok because next time you’ll be prepared and leave the carafe on to catch it to later clean that out. Annoying, but fine.  Why is it fine? BECAUSE I WANT MY COFFEE! Now the machine has a new residence on a cookie pan to catch as much water as I can while filling it or filling a cup.  The husband bought a different machine for himself as he finds this one stupid and will not give up his other thumb.  I however will not be beaten! I have a small cup next to the machine to fill up to then pour into my cup.  Filling my thermos with this will never work.  This machine, with its annoying bright blue display that I have to cover because nothing needs to be that bright when I’m trying to get my coffee first thing in the morning, will not beat me!  Btw, if you can get your hands on the old machine from 15 years ago, it’s so worth...RIP old coffee carafe, I miss you!"
"October 29, 2020",Tara M.,2.0,,"My husband and I have been looking at this style of fully contained coffee pot for quite some time... We finally decided to order this one after looking at many variations!  We were not impressed with the internal heated holding compartment!  It did not seem to keep the coffee even as warm as a regular, glass carafe does!  It also made cleaning quite difficult!  It truly made us not even want to make any coffee in the morning as it would NOT be hot and then was such a pain to clean up what was left!  There was usually most of the coffee left as we do not like cold or lukewarm coffee!  After putting just a splash of French Vanilla Coffee mate into the cup of coffee, it was barely lukewarm!  I was not interested in microwaving every cup of coffee to drink it... Microwaving the coffee seems to make it taste a little funny!  We did return this coffee maker quite quickly after trying it only a handful of times to much disappointment!"
"November 28, 2017",Retired Guy,4.0,One,"I bought this to replace a much older version of the same model because the lid hinge broke after many years of use.  It's been redesigned and works very well.  It's much quieter than the older version and the lid hinge is much better.  This one should last for many years.  However, there is one small, but frustrating feature. I make a full pot each time and pour it into a large glass (saved from the days when they were still made of glass) orange juice container with an air tight lid that I put into my refrigertor.  I'm finding it difficult to pour into the small opening on the juice container due to the materials and design of the bucket which holds the brewed coffee.  It always seems to spill all over.  The spout is a very slick plastic and can't be rested on the opening without sliding.  Plus, the spout is very shallow and on a square, flat side, so the coffee wants to pour out of the corners.  I have to pour it very, very slowly."
"July 15, 2021",Bob McLeran,3.0,,"Just purchased our third Brewmaster. This is the world's greatest coffee maker for those who drink a lot of coffee and don't want to taste the ""boiled and scorched"" flavor of coffee which stays in those glass containers on a burner. My wife and I drink 12 cups (coffee cups, that is) a day, easily, so it gets a lot of use. That being said: you'll eventually have to replace the ""coffee tank"" portion of the Brewmaster because the little valve that releases brewed coffee becomes unseated due to coffee residue which forms around the base of the sealing ring and is impossible to clean (believe me, I've tried more than once, even removing the valve). Also, the little filter in the bottom of the ""coffee tank"" is permanent, and doesn't get clean enough to allow a like-new flow even following the directions for cleaning which comes with the Brewmaster (cycling the brewing stages using vinegar/water combinations). This is a great example of poor design! Filter needs to be replaceable (the earlier version had a replaceable, screw-on filter) and something needs to be done about redesigning the release valve (perhaps make it replaceable, also). Only option currently is to buy a new ""coffee tank"" if you can find one."
"December 22, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Well, we just tossed out our third BrewStation. The first one we purchased, over six years ago, lasted about three years. We liked the taste of the coffee from it so much that we replaced it with a second BrewStation. That one lasted about two years. Figuring that we get quite a bit of use from these as we're several-cups-per-day java drinkers, and it's us, not the machine...we went for our third (and last) BrewStation earlier this year. That one lasted under a year. It started to leak everywhere, wouldn't keep coffee warm, and didn't process all the water. After contacting Hamilton-Beach for a warranty replacement and receiving no reply back (yes, our latest BrewStation was still under warranty), we're done with Hamilton-Beach products and will be graduating to a Keurig very soon. Sorry, HB - you lost loyal customers; but then again...maybe your products should be built to last for a couple of years, not a couple of months. Update: actually, we did hear back from HB (took over two weeks) informing us that an new BrewStation will be sent to us. We already decided - since tomorrow is Christmas Day - that one family gift will be a new Keurig coffeemaker. So, we'll probably donate the replacement BrewStation to a charity. At least HB contacted us and is issuing a replacement, so gotta give credit where it's due."
"June 20, 2018",Gadgets_Are_Great,3.0,4,"Hamilton Beach had a very good idea with the concept but unfortunately the plastic material that they used to make product is very flimsy.  The dispenser which sprays the coffee into the holding tank is attached to the machines inside top - but on mine it slips out when the top is opened - so I find myself having to force the two pieces to clip back together. Not only that; at the end of the day when it's time to clean the machine and open the top, the water that was steam spells out through the back of the coffee maker and onto my countertop - this is definitely a design defect or flaw. It will fit on a countertop with kitchen cabinets above but expect to have to pull the coffee maker out in order to add water, grounds and to clean it. It makes a great cup of coffee but the machine itself is quite flimsy."
"February 23, 2020",Sheri Ramirez,1.0,,"This coffeemaker seems rather chintzy compared to past Hamilton Beach appliances I have owned over the years. First, it is so light we have to position it against the wall otherwise it will slide back when pressing the cup against the dispenser. The reservoir plastic seems very thin compared to past models. The whole thing seems flimsy.  It makes coffee, but had I seen a display model in a store I would have not purchased this. I purchased based on brand reputation, but I suppose Hamilton Beach is now planning to rest on its laurels as far as that takes them.  I do not recommend this product. UPDATE: November 3, 2020, the coffee pot stopped working. Nov. 1, I noticed a weird, electrical buzzing sound, so I unplugged it. Nov. 2, we plugged it in, it was quiet, clock and some other features didn’t work, but it made coffee.  Today, Nov. 3, it won’t work at all. We bought this in March. May 10, 2020, we went to our summer home and returned October 11, 2020. So, this new Hamilton Beach coffee maker was only used about 3 months, but is now junk."
"June 22, 2020",Shonda C.,2.0,,UPDATE : SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW IN DRIP TRAY!  For days I have been trying to figure out why after I make a pot of coffee  there is coffee ALL OVER my counter underneath the pot.  The drip tray is NOT firmly attached.  Ir was held on by tape so I thought it was all one unit molded FROM the pot.  After I took the tape off the tray comes out at the slightest movement or touch to it.  Save your money and cleaning a big MESS!  RETURNING THIS ASAP!!! Always something so nice about a pot of coffee from a new pot!  I love that it brewed nice and hot and the option to increase the strength is lovely!  This pot is taller than average because of the two removable parts.  Your brew basket and the water measures comes out of the heating tank.  I have an eye impairment so the ease of seeing the bold numbers for measuring and the blue led lighting on the face helps tremendously!  Hamilton Beach has always maintained -at least for me- quality at a great price ans simplicity cause at the end of the day all I want is a great cuppa!!!
"August 4, 2018",Kristy,3.0,2,"This drips and leaks some, so I keep a cup under the spout.  I feel like it tries to brew all of the time instead of keeping warm. It never stops sounding like it's brewing. I don't think I can exchange it at this point for a working model, so I'll probably just wait until this one dies and then try a different type of coffee pot. This is my second Brewstation, my last one didn't have any of the weird issues I have with this one, I would have rated it 5 stars. Buy this at your own risk, I suppose."
"June 8, 2020",Jeff L,1.0,,"UPDATE 2:  I received the new water tank, but the dripping/leak problem still occurs just ever so slightly less, but still makes a mess and runs down the side of the coffee cup and the coffee maker and eventually everywhere.  Who wants that?? At least in June of 2020 from whatever stock I'm getting the product FAILS.  I am returning through Amazon.  And now we are stuck for a while using our old model that just 2 nights ago decided to empty it's water tank overnight which then ran down the cabinets and behind our fridge onto our wood floor.  Hamilton Beach has some work to do.  They have lost me as a customer. ----- UPDATE:  So I submitted a customer service request online since phones are not being manned due to COVID-19, and got a response within the time frame given .  They are sending me a new part and covering shipping costs.  This is the best response expected and I will update again if this corrects the problem described below. ----- Just replaced my old Brewmaster with a faulty one.  Love this one overall and hope to get this issue resolved.  Coffee dispenses out through the normal opening HOWEVER it also runs along the mechanism (see arrows in images) and then down the face of the coffeemaker, over the dispenser bar and overflowing the drip tray.  I have a customer service request into Hamilton Beach, and I will update this post.  Kind of disappointed because we replaced our older one (different style) due to the water tank randomly leaking (and I tried a lot of fixes to no avail).  I have not seen any other similar complaints, so hoping this is a fluke.  Hamilton Beach, please don't make me an ex-customer."
"January 19, 2016",Kelley,2.0,2,"At first, I liked it.  As I use it more, I'm liking it less.  It looks nice on the counter, but here are my issues... - its almost impossible to clean well.  Even after I'm done cleaning the area where the hot coffee is stored, once it dries, I find a ton of area's my sponge didn't get to.  There are just lots of ""bumps"" and ""lines"" and other things that make it impossible to clean well.  Even the clear gauge on the side that tells you how much coffee is in there (which you have to turn the pot to the side to even see anyway) is hard to get a finger and sponge into, or else you leave that dark coffee scuzz. - Its not heavy enough.  If its not full of coffee, the unit is light enough so it just slides back on the counter until it hits the wall before you can put enough pressure on the lever to release the coffee.  I have to put my hand on top of the pot to hold it in place while I get travel mug filled. - most of my travel mugs don't fit under it.  I have to hold them on an angle to fill, so even if there was a light under there (a competing model does have this feature) you wouldn't be able to see if your travel mug is full because you need to tip it away from you to catch the coffee, or it runs down the side and off the bottom towards your arm. - sometimes it doesn't beep when its done.  I guess I don't really care about this, but some people might. - this might be nitpicking, but it seems to use a LOT of coffee.  To get the coffee to my desired strength, I have to put 8 scoops of delicious chock full o' nuts in there to make 10 cups of coffee.  My old drip pot used to take 5 for 10 cups of coffee.  Again, this isn't a big deal, but the pot has already soured me, so I'm going to pile it on...."
"March 17, 2016",Megal,3.0,7,"This machine makes great coffee. I use it to make 10 cups every day. Works good. However it is ridiculous to clean and keep clean. There are so many places for residue to accumulate throughout the brewing areas especially around the outside of the dispenser gasket which is recessed and nearly impossible to clean and the dispenser screen above it. After brewing when opening the lid water will drip down the back side onto the power cord unless you hold a towel behind the hinge. Very poor design in this respect.  The drip tray sits upon a collection reservoir which is also difficult to clean. You have to really get in there with an edge to clean the corners. There is no memory for the controls so it has to be plugged in all the time. There is no way to dim the extremely bright blue light on the control panel. I love the dispenser idea without the carafe but the trade off with the difficulty of cleaning the machine is not worth it. You cannot just wipe out the water reservoir and dispenser with a paper towel or dish rag. You have to use a brush. I use a large, artist bristle brush for this. Also the heating pad which the coffee dispenser sits upon accumulates a stain very quickIy which makes me wonder if it continues to build up. I could not clean it without a stainless steel cleaner. I would not recommend this coffee maker. I will probably take this machine to the second hand store and try another brand or style. Too many things to clean."
"April 24, 2021",rac rach,2.0,,Up Until 5 years ago I was never a coffee drinker (thanks to my first kid). I had no idea what features to look for in a coffee maker. I bought this exact model back in 2016. I've retired it as of today because (1) coffee comes out warm (2) leaks at the bottom (3) despite the bold button coffee still tastes weak unless you use a lot more coffee (4) even though I clean it by running it through with vinegar it still looks dirty. Unless you have small hands to fit inside the reservoir there will still be a film of coffee. I'm only sad to part with it only because it's been with me for many moves and it was my saving grace for all those sleepless nights because of my kids. But this mama of 3 needs her coffee to stay hot and needs less cleaning to do.
"May 23, 2020",Steve Denny,1.0,,"You know, when you see a pretty decent rating after 10K reviews you think, ""Maybe those bad reviews were corrected by the manufacture"" or ""Maybe the CEO for Hamilton Beach products might have seen the bad reviews and made sure someone was held accountable.  Maybe it was one of those 5 o'clock Friday products where whomever was assembling the product had one foot out the door for the weekend, who knows? The bottom line is the coffee maker worked great for about 3 months, and then it began leaking from underneath the container that holds the made coffee. So...Hamilton Beach, you got me on this one. But now, how many good people out there will read this review and decide NOT to buy this coffee maker. It's really a crying shame, I liked the looks and design of this coffee maker, but if it leaves a puddle of made coffee on your kitchen counter under the maker, what's the point? If Hamilton Beach was really serious about taking care of a problem like that and sent me another coffee maker, I'd give them a big thumbs up. But that's corporate America sometimes, ""Production...not performance"""
"March 29, 2021",timothy kullmann,3.0,,"The device is really good, it brews relatively quickly and the ""Bold"" setting is nice since I like my coffee strong but when you push the dispense button, it leaks from around the button.  I now know why it has a decent sized catch pan under the nozzle...never once has it leaked or dripped from the nozzle, always from the dispense button.  The catch pan is a little hard to clean after you take out the grate, you have to repeatedly dip a sponge into it to suck up the coffee it catches from the leaky dispense button.  Oh, and did I mention the dispense button leaks?  The coffee that leaks from the dispense button rapidly stains the ""stainless"" steel front and it takes a bit of elbow grease to get that all off too.  Otherwise, the inside areas are very easy to clean.  Not only that, but the dispense button leaks too! Also, the coffee maker only runs for 4 hours and if you can't drink 12 cups of coffee in 4 hours time, it's microwave city for you baby!  And did I mention...The dispense button leaks! If you can get past all those things, then it's a pretty good machine, if not, look for something else."
"September 7, 2020",victorywine,2.0,,"I bought this to replace a carafe-free H-B I bought in 2006 that finally gave up the ghost after 13 years of dutiful service. I wanted to stay with H-B due to that proven reliability. I was really happy with this unit until about the last 2 weeks, my only complaint being that the coffee wasn't as hot as I like it until it sat in the tank for a few minutes.  But lately it doesn't properly transfer all the water from the reservoir to the tank, so I end up with less coffee that's way to strong.  The only way to make it finish the job is to restart the unit once or twice per brew, which completely renders the scheduling feature useless. I make about 6-8 cup pots every morning.  I've filled this with DI water since I bought it, and running liquid line cleaner through it hasn't helped.  So I think this is just a bad unit.  I am now looking for a replacement, and I cannot recommend anyone buy this coffee maker."
"September 23, 2020",Happy Amazon Customer,1.0,,"This ""was"" my 3rd Brewstation purchased in the last 10 years.  The 2 previous models (48464) did not have a removeable water tank  and each lasted 4-5 years with daily use.  I love the non-carafe design and Hamilton Beach coffee makers brew and hold warm a great tasting cup of coffee.  I, again, went to the Brewstation when I needed to replace my coffee maker earlier this year  When searching, I found this model (47950) which included a removeable water tank.  What a great update!  No more dribbled water on the counter when filling (a skill that you CAN master but...why not try this?).  Today, after 4 months of daily use, my new and improved Brewstation is dead.  The problem started with a leak from the bottom of the brewer discovered when an almost entire pot of brewed coffee leaked out over the counter.  The next time I brewed, I put the machine on a baking sheet to catch the leak and emptied the coffee as it brewed.  Workable, although it was only delaying the inevitable (and who wants to do this much work at 5am?).  This morning, after a few days of the manual process, a loud POP occurred when I turned the machine on...it sounded electrical and dangerous.  Bottom-line, this is an unreliable, potentially dangerous machine.  4 months of service is not good.  I am faithful to this brand, but I will return to the original model of the Brewstation.  This is one of those cases where I should have paid attention to the negative reviews."
"October 2, 2018",mary williams,3.0,2,"This is our 4th Hamilton Beach Brewstation and we love having no carafe and the 4 hour keep warm feature. We have found they don't last more than a couple of years before something goes wrong but we like the coffeemaker well enough that we keep buying new ones. We just got this newest one and are having a problem that I don't see anyone else having. We make 12 cups and the instructions say to add no more than 12 tablespoons of coffee. We only add 8 but the coffee grounds always overflow the basket and are all over the lid of the coffeemaker. The instructions say this could be caused by a cheap filter (we switched to a more expensive paper filter), adding too much coffee (we are adding less than instructed) or coffee ground too fine (I switched to coffee beans which I ground at the store using the drip setting). I don't know what else to try. If this wasn't happening I would have given this 5 stars."
"February 17, 2021",Michael A. Katz,4.0,,"This Coffee Maker was very well thought out with only a few exceptions. Using the tank to fill the water limits you to exactly 12 cups where the older Brew Station, you were actually able to get 14 cups out of. Emptying the water is a bit more difficult until you get the hang of it but I recommend keeping a towel under it while filling. I still would recommend this product if you don't like decanters. Pros, great coffee, fairly easy to clean, Tank shows coffee lever on both sides. Cons, more difficult to fill compared to old Brew Station until you get the hang of it, can't make more than 12 cups at a time as compared to the older Brew Station and the rubber feet are undersized and come out when you slide the Brew Station into place."
"July 17, 2021",Amy H,5.0,,"I was skeptical because of a few negative reviews.. But we've had this for a few weeks now and so far it's great! We switched from a 6 year old Keurig 2.0 that was starting to act up. I love the programmable settings for both brewing and how long to keep the coffee hot. (I know this is not a new concept but a regular coffee maker tends to 'burn' the coffee as it keeps it warm) He leaves for work at 4:30 a.m. and I leave 3 hours later. We set it up the night before to be ready when he wakes up and the coffee is still hot when I get up, but doesn't taste like it's been sitting for hours. It's easy to clean and easy to use! I love that all you have to do in the morning is put your cup under the spout and push!"
"March 15, 2018",Shopper X,1.0,2,"UPDATE: The spout started leaking coffee all over the place less than a year and a half after we bought it. Just threw it away today. Disappointing. Bad design.  I wouldn’t recommend anyone buy this. We had a previous model of this coffee maker in the office for probably 15 years until the spout finally clogged up. It was so great for so long it convinced us to buy the same make and a similar model again. The old model we had, where the basket was picked up and water was poured in below was a much better design than this move to the unnecessary water reservoir on the side. I assume this is in response to the Kurig design but people are choosing not to buy a Kurig for a reason. Because of this change the basket now is constantly wet and changing the filters is a very wet process always necessitating several paper towels even if we last made coffee on Friday and it is now Monday morning, the water has no way to evaporate. Someone in the office said the coffee doesn't seem as hot as the previous coffeemaker made it, which may be good in that it is not burning the coffee. This still has the program feature which is a nice perk although I can't say I've noticed much of a difference in the brew strength options which was on par with our previous coffeemaker as well so nothing was lost there. I'm glad to have a coffeemaker without a glass carafe that isn't a Kurig with those associated costs which don't make sense in our office environment but I wish they would have left the original design alone."
"June 24, 2019",McGap,3.0,,"We must really like these little coffee makers as we have had 4 of them now! The first one of this particular model (48465) with the stainless face we had for nearly 4 hears before it began to leak underneath. We replaced it with the same model and it lasted 2 years. Recently we bought yet another identical one, but this time we were disappointed. It leaked right off the bat. As you pressed in to pour your coffee, it would dribble down the back. Sometimes this happened while you were pouring it; sometimes it just dribbled a bit more after you let the lever go. There's a little catch basin at the bottom, but there is also (for some odd reason) and opening that leads under the coffee maker. What runs down tends to run under it making a mess. We cleaned the pot, examined it six ways and side ways and just couldn't see what could be causing the issue. In the end we returned it, BUT we reordered it yet again! We really like the coffeemaker, you see. Sadly, the one that came had the same issue right out of the box. In the end, we returned that one too and are now trying a different HB model (47900) that is configured a little differently. So far it has not leaked. At some future time I will likely review it also. It's too bad that the reviews are all lumped together for all the models as you can't tell which model they are for. That's why I've added those numbers. I've given it 3 stars because we have had good use out of previous ones, but if they are poorly manufactured, it's no good."
"January 16, 2018",Karen Xavier,5.0,5,"Me and my husband are coffee junkies and I bought this for him since his other coffee maker broke. Once we plugged it in and set it up it did take a minute to figure out how to use it since we dumped the water in the wrong place...but once we figured that out and turned it on it was quick to heat and doesn’t drip like other coffee makers do. The brewing time is a nice feature which keeps the coffee warm for a certain amount of time and up to 4 hours, and also the programmable time is a plus since he wakes up early and doesn’t have to worry about making coffee as it turns on and starts to brew on the set time. We haven’t had any leaks, and find this to be wayyy nicer than other coffee makers like this we had in the past."
"December 12, 2019",Soulfoxx,4.0,,"I like the convenience of this coffee maker. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The flavor of the coffee is always delicious with no residue or tinny taste. It brews pretty quick, and you can dispense while brewing—but if you like hot, hot coffee, wait. The keep warm feature is great. It’s super easy to clean! Only concerns are the display for more than 1-4 cups never shows up. Even if you program 1-4 cups it will brew all the water—if it were a truly programmable maker it should be able to calculate water usage. The actual coffee dispenser does not work as easily as stated. If the cup isn’t heavy enough, you have to use your hand to press the dispenser bar to release the coffee, thereby losing the one hand capability claim. I do recommend this as a economical and still great coffee maker in spite of those minor issues."
"December 13, 2020",Grateful,1.0,,"Such a shame! I had this product for 2 years and loved it before it leaked all over my counter and floor! Cleaning it did nothing. Well, decided to get another one and this one is leaking after 10 days!!! I'm reading the same from many reviewers. What's up Hamilton Beach??  Why are you continuing to sell this? I tried another one of your models before getting this one. Pure junk! Sorry HB, you've lost my respect and business! I won't be getting any more products from you!! I really loved so many features on this coffee maker too. It's just a shame you refused to fix a simple leak!! I was using a turkey baster to remove all the accumulated coffee by the Keep Warm Plate under the coffee tank.  It's such a shame! The concept was great, the execution was pure trash!!"
"February 26, 2021",DHayes,1.0,,"So, I bought this machine to replace a machine I had had for a few years but had started to leak.  I couldn't wait to get it so I could stop having to wipe up coffee every time I made a pot.  Only, I got a product that made me wipe up every time I got a cup.  When you try to use the machine, coffee goes in the cup but also goes behind the cup and gets all over the place, including under the machine itself.  So, once again, or should say I never stopped, having to wipe up coffee from the counters and move the machine to wipe under it and to get the bottom of the machine itself or it would just leave more coffee. I tried everything, smaller, thinner cup; pushing harder/lighter; tilting cup back/forward; moving cup around; held the cup higher/lower; and then had quite a few friends see if they could figure it out (to make sure it wasn't just me) but more than 10 people had the same issue. Sadly, I wanted this machine to work so very badly, and tried too long and the window of returns was already gone, so it looks like I am simply out the money.  Awesome.  Love throwing money away!"
"October 10, 2019",lpb,5.0,,"I bought a Hamilton Beach Brew Master almost 20 years ago that lasted me till yesterday morning.  The seal finally gave up after daily use.  I have never been disappointed with my old Brew Master and went right on line to find this upgrade. Next day shipping is very handy when it comes to having to have a morning coffee.  When it came in, I immediately noticed the condition of the bottom of the box and sighed hoping it was not damaged on the inside.  Low and behold it’s was not as the inside packaging kept the outside damage clear away from the unit.  Washed all the usable parts of the brewer to brew my first cup of coffee from it.  So easy to set up, programming much easier than the old one.  I especially like the idea of having a 4 hour choice of keeping coffee hot.  The older one only had a 2 hour limit.  I am very happy with this new upgrade.  ☕️ Happy Brewing!!"
"June 6, 2018",HappyInNebrasky,1.0,3,"This thing is TERRIBLE! I ordered it because I like the idea of not having to deal with a carafe and the length that it is supposed to keep your coffee hot. What's not mentioned is how LOUD this thing is. It gurgles and steams constantly. I thought I could deal with that, but then the buttons started to wear off. NOW it has started leaking all over my counter and floor. Complete waste if money. None of these things (except for the noise) started happening within the return period. I'm completely bummed with the quality of this product, and expected something much better from this company. Save your money, folks. Unless you want to be randomly mopping up leaking coffee every day."
"November 13, 2020",rob,1.0,One,"I cannot believe that this product ever made it past the testing stage to ever get produced. The design of the water reservoir is such that there is an overflow hole barely above the fill line.  Any movement of the coffee maker once filled and ready to brew will cause water to slosh out the hole, drip down the back and then pool on the counter under the coffee maker. Even if you are careful pre-brew, once brewed the design of the spigot is such that while filling a cup, there is no clear drip edge.  Therefore the surface tension of the coffee causes it to creep back along the underside of the coffee revivor and run down the front of the coffee maker.  While not ideal, this should be caught by the drip tray, but again due to poor design, capillary action causes it to leak past and again pool up under the coffee maker. I kept it thinking that I would just repair it as it made good coffee, and I like the style of maker washout the carafe.  However, then the cleaning light came on, and after cleaning it according to the instructions, the light just stayed on.  Even so, it did continue to make good coffee, as long as you don't mind a good percentage of it on your counter. For me however, that was the last straw.  Previously I had a carafe-less Cuisinart and I found a newer model of that one, and I ordered it.  I love it.  The Hamilton Beach is going into the trash."
"October 1, 2016",Mono,5.0,One,"I use to be a coffee maker snob and would only buy a Krups or Braun coffee maker (do they still make those????)  Anyway, about four years ago, we switched to this Brew Station because our top line brand went dead and I needed a quick fix for the next morning.  I went to Walmart thinking I could get a temporary fix with a cheap coffee maker.  What I stumbled across was this Brew Station.  I liked the idea of not having a coffee pot, typically made of glass, breakable and always getting burned coffee if it sat for an hour plus.  I am absolutely in love with this coffee maker.  I love the dispenser that my wife and I can just push and receive a stream of hot and delicious coffee in our cup.  We must have our morning dose and this does the trick. At under $40 with a high level of coffee flavor without the thermos or glass carafe, it is the absolute best.  We've been through two of them in 4 years but have gotten more than our money's worth.  I don't understand why there aren't other copy cat version out there from other manufacturers?  Oh, well, I hope Hamilton Beach keeps this in their line up because I'm a fan or life!  I don't know how anything this good could be under $40......you will not be disappointed!"
"January 3, 2021",Ann,2.0,,"I've owned at least 5-6 of this exact coffee maker over the years.  I purchased this one, because it looked a little different.  Other then being mostly black plastic, it had the ss full front.  Unfortunately, the coffee dribbles down the front of the machine when you fill your coffee cup, which makes me have to wipe off the ss area every time I fill my cup.  This machine is obviously defective, but if I had purchased the older/cheaper model of this machine(that doesn't have the ss front) I probably wouldn't have noticed the dribbling because this area is all black plastic.  Needless to say, I'm returning it.  I've decided to purchase the Cuisinart brand, carafe-less coffee maker....well see how that one works out."
"March 12, 2021",vince Lombardi,1.0,,"I clean the coffee tank every night to make sure their is no debria inside, when I move to coffee pot from under the counter I have coffee on the counter top under the pot, when you get the coffee out, it doesn't seem to be leaking but later I have more coffee all over the counter. I am told because the window on returning it has closed I will not get a complete refund. This coffee pot is junk, save your money Amazon was no help, the support rep must be working from home, the noise in the background was so bad you could not understand him he spoke broken English as well. Tried calling Hamilton Beach what a joke closed due to the covid virus, never again will I purchase their product."
"February 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"We purchased this coffee maker a few years back. Admittedly, we didn't really go the extra mile on cleaning it thoroughly. Over time, the dispenser, just wasn't quite right and no matter how much we cleaned and tried to correct the problem the leaking along the back side when you filled your cup just kept getting worse. We decided we really did like this maker so much that we'd buy another one and this time take better care of it.  SOOOOO, after getting the 3rd one in a row. Each of the units had the same problem right out of the gate. When you go to dispense the coffee in your cup, no matter what you do, some of the coffee runs along the backside of the unit, misses the cup and you can't capture the liquid--a mess each time. Ugg, who wants that! We are convinced that there is a bad batch going out and as much as we loved this coffee maker, the defect is a problem and needs to get resolved. We have moved on and want the company to know that they need to go back to the drawing board on their design and figure it out before shipping out more of them.  When you hit round 3, sadly, you're done.  For now, buyer beware."
"September 21, 2019",junebug624,5.0,,"This is our third Hamilton Beach that dispenses the coffee. We love it! We use our coffee maker every single day and sometime more than one pot is brewed. So this is our third one over 13 years since we purchased our first. We love setting up the coffee the night before so it’s brewed when we come downstairs. It’s very easy to change the timer for weekend wake up times vs weekday. It only has a timer to keep the coffee pot hot up to 4 hours. If you need it to stay hot longer it’s easy enough to turn that function on and off after a couple of hours so it stays on for four more. It can also turn off after 1,2 or 3 hours. We grind our own beans so I can only give a flavor review based on grinding beans but I’m sure it would work just as great with ground coffee."
"November 12, 2020",James,1.0,,"I had the last one for a long time, it was tough to throw out but a poor design caused the dispenser to fail like many others noted in their reviews.  I ordered another and it came and instantly leaked so I returned it.  Ordered one more and now after 6 months the gasket on the resevoir failed and caused coffee to leak all over inside it and on the counter, the unit is now failed as a whole and I am left with a coffee pot that cost 10 per month to use until it failed.  I contacted customer support and got an email back stating that the request was received but I never heard back.  If their quality and customer service wasn't embarassingly bad, this would be a five star review."
"August 16, 2020",Michael D. Bishop,1.0,,"When I first got this it was great. Don't get me wrong it still makes great coffee, but if you don't empty the reservoir right away most of the coffee will end up on the countertop and the floor and make a mess of your drawers and doors. Do not buy this unless you plan to move the coffee to carafe right away, even doing that I still get a little coffee on the counter. I thought this would be a great machine but I am very disappointed and need to buy a new coffee maker 3 months later. thinking its time to back to old school percolator. TODAY THE THING MADE A POPING NOISE AND LET OUT SMOKE - NOW IT DOES NOT HEAT - IN MY EXPERIENCE THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK. ABOUT 3 MONTHS AND I HAVE TO BUY YET ANOTHER COFFEEMAKER."
"May 17, 2021",Skyqueen,2.0,,"Nice looking and just cool to use, but I  would not buy again. It leaked 2 times soon after I  got it from the bottom then was fine. I have had it one year!!!  Three days ago it just stopped. It leaked badly from where the coffee comes out even when not in use. It leaked all over my counter and onto the floor  a little. I had to put a towel  beneath it for the last 3 days to keep my counter from being covered with coffee. The 4th morning it would not make coffee!!! It turned on and that was it. I tried turning off and on again  and unplugged numerous times to see if it might reset. NOPE!!! SO it goes out in tomorrow's garbage. One year old and looks brand new. Not happy!!!!! I went to a local store and bought cheapest  coffee maker I could find. From now on I  will not pay much for coffee makers. Things are being made cheap to not last long leaving us customers paying the price. Please improve your designs and make them to last  many years!!!"
"June 17, 2019",TT,3.0,,"This coffee maker brews fine but it has two big issues (at least for me) with design. First is that the tray on the bottom is WAY too small. My cup doesn't even fit halfway on so it's completely useless.I thought I could deal with it but it proved to be a bigger issue than I thought. Now you need two hands to pour your coffee. One to hold the machine because it slides back if you don't. Two.....We save any left over coffee and pour it into a pitcher for ice coffee. Wait till you try to pour it into something lol. Seriously.......worst spout ever! Unless you literally pour a very slow, tiny trickle, your counter will be drinking way more than you!  On a good note, I'm glad you can remove the water tank to clean. Coffee tastes decent. Seems to brew a little faster than my previous coffee maker. If you can get past the two issues I mentioned, Enjoy!"
"August 8, 2019",Joseph B.,2.0,One,"This is the 2nd one of these that I have purchased, this one in Dec 2017, because for some reason I had thought that they had fixed the flaw of the first one. Like the first one from 2014, the coffee flow is SLOWING DOWN because the plastic lever that is behind where you push to dispense the coffee, that is next to a HEAT source, is bending when it is pressed. It will eventually break, to the point that the coffee flow is a trickle, to where it doesn't even work at all. I had tried putting a penny behind the lever, which helped for a while, but again, it will eventually break because some engineer at Hamilton Beach thought it would be a good idea to put a cheap plastic lever that gets pressed on everyday next to a heat source. They should have made that part out of metal or at least a material that is not affected by a heat source. I won't ever buy this model 47950 again, and may not buy Hamilton Beach again."
"June 10, 2021",Edward Hauser,4.0,,The design of this particular model that holds the coffee above and has the push button to release coffee into a cup is flawed. As an engineer I can see that the plastic dispenser needs a lip to prevent water tension similar to what happens when rain runs off a roof into a gutter. If done improperly the water attaches to the underside of the surface and runs back. When this happens on this model the coffee runs down the area where the button is toward the overflow. Another issue is a gap that allows that coffee to bypass the overflow and it runs onto the counter. All of these will leak unless they are redesigned. Read all the reviews pertaining to leaks. They are experiencing the same thing I am without understanding why.
"September 8, 2016",Donald R. Whittington,5.0,3,"Our coffee maker gave up the ghost a while back, and I was forced to look for an alternative. I intended to use Amazon for research to see what was out there but the combination of price and same day delivery for Prime members made this too hard to resist.  I love this machine. It brews great coffee, it is easy to set up, and delivers a cup on demand with no carafe and no expensive, planet-contaminating pods. Despite the claims that there is ""no burned coffee taste"" it is obvious that flavor deteriorates and grows more harsh after the first hour or so, but not nearly so quickly as it did with my old carafe system. A nice surprise is that the design is such there is no wet coffee ground build-up in hard to reach creases around the basket, ensuring that everything stays fresh and clean over time. Well done, Hamilton Beach. I am a fan."
"March 13, 2021",CW,2.0,,"I've had 2 of these units over the course of 10 years.  The first one was *mostly* amazing.  It lasted several years, but then would constantly say it needed to be cleaned (even though I did so regularly and only used filtered water in it) and stopped brewing a whole pot. I chalked it up to its age, and bought a new one last year, since I had liked the first one so much. Huge mistake I guess. After about a month, it was only brewing about half a full pot. (Again, I was regularly cleaning it and using filtered water). Then about 3 months after purchasing, it wouldn't even brew a full cup without having to shut the machine off, wait about 30 seconds, then turn it on again. But still would only brew about half a cup. I've been babying it since, which has just been a major pain in the a*s. (The newer one has never indicated that it needs to be cleaned but I do clean it regularly) I don't know if Hamilton Beach made changes to this model in between the two I had, but this last one really changed my mind about this product. I will never buy this brand again. I'm now on the lookout for another, similar style, coffee maker. But definitely from a different company."
"November 19, 2020",Victoria Kitz,2.0,,"Aside from it being a flimsy design, I honestly liked this coffee maker. My coffee was always hot, and I prefer brewed coffee over the keurigs I had used the last 10 years. I feel like the problem lies in the design of this machine. I only had it for 7 months, I cleaned it every time I used it and I ran white vinegar through it every 4-6 weeks. The last few days I had noticed a little bit of coffee on my counter but I couldn't figure out where it was coming from. This morning I came into my kitchen to the entire tank leaked out on my counter. When I took it apart and tried to figure out where it was leaking from, I noticed it was leaking quite steadily from the metal heating plate in the middle of the tank. I filled it with water and watched it stream out. After only 7 months of well cared for use this shouldn't happen. So I don't think it's a very well designed machine, especially after cleaning 10 cups of coffee off my counter and floor this morning, without my morning cup of coffee."
"February 24, 2016",Walter,3.0,3,"ALMOST everything in the product description is true. It IS convenient to dispense coffee without a separate pot.  It DOES make coffee that taste just fine.  But it DOES NOT keep your coffee ""warm for hours without that scorched taste"".  That's a bunch of baloney.  If you let it keep your coffee warm for even ONE hour, it tastes like cr*p.  Simple - if you keep heat on the coffee for too long, it burns.  It's not rocket science.  Now, if they had put a thermostat in there with the heating element, I can see that it might work, but then it'd cost more than $30, right? So, if you only make the amount of coffee you can drink in under an hour - much less than the 12 cups it will hold, unless you have a crowd, you'll be fine.  But, don't expect it to keep your coffee warm for hours and expect it to taste like anything but burned coffee, because that's what you'll have. So, I'm happy with the coffee maker function, but I just don't make more than a few cups at a time and it's OK."
"October 26, 2019",Callie Betz,5.0,One,"Just received today, already brewed and LOVE the easy of the design!! Can do a cup, 4 or a whole pot. I purchased because of the specified design attention to the water reservoir and lack of glass carafe. My mother and I have medical issues and being able to remove a plastic water container to carry to the sink and back, is worth the price alone, but so many added benefits come with the one handed dispensary and ability to auto shut of the heating element. Only thing I can think of to improve this product is adding lighting to the dispenser due to the black background it is difficult to see the pour into a dark cup. So happy I chose this coffee maker and I am only on my first cup!! I am sure This will be in my family for many years to come"
"February 7, 2019",David C,5.0,,"Love, love, love it!  I got this as a gift for my future mother-in-law who had accidentally bought a smaller standard coffee pot and often hosts guests at home. I helped her set it up and immediately fell in love with it!  The other reviews are true, and it’s really as simple as it looks in their video clip! The entire top part lifts right off, and beneath is the water reservoir.  It even had lines for how many cups of coffee you want to brew! The top has two parts: 1.  The coffee filter piece, where you load your ground coffee. 2.  A reservoir for the brewed coffee, which features a heating element that can keep coffee hot for up to 1-4 hours, with an adjustable setting.  It also has clouded plastic windows on the sides so you can see how much coffee is left! You just push your cup against the dispenser button and coffee pours right in! I’ll be ordering another one of these for myself soon!!"
"June 11, 2021",Ronald C. Seitz,1.0,,"This would have been our 3rd Hamilton Beach Brew Staton coffee maker.  We love the design and the absence of a glass carafe.  Unfortunately, after making one pot of coffee and having the entire contents drain out on my counter and down my (white) cabinets, we were in shock.  After cleaning everything up, we regained our composure, checked to see if we had done everything correctly the first time and decided to try again, this time with water only.  Exactly the same thing happened again.  That was it...repacked unit and returned the next day.  So disappointed.  Would love to have this  style again but this model is apparently flawed.; wish I could rate it ZERO stars."
"December 27, 2019",Amanda Lamers,1.0,One,"We purchased 2 of these Coffee Makers, one for us and one for my Mom. Ours is Awesome, everything works great super convenient when I am the only one that drinks coffee at our house but still great when there is company. The one we purchase for my mom however has been problems since she first filled it up. There was a leak. Every time she uses it there is a puddle of water on the counter. Well she finally took it apart and found a hole in the reservoir where water is leaking out. We checked ours, no hole. Contact the manufacture, and they want us to pay to have a part shipped to us which will take 3-4 weeks and we don't even know if it will for sure fix the issue. Just seems weird that they will not replace the maker or at least ship the part out to make this right. We have come to expect better customer service from Amazon Sellers, too bad this is not the case."
"April 13, 2021",Grandma,5.0,,I really love this coffee maker no cafe to clean or worry about breaking that thing it’s really simple to use no water spillage just two simple steps to use add coffee to brew cup and filled up the water holder and hit the on button and you will have a hot and steamy cup of coffee within 3 minutes but it not to be strong arm because the push button to dispense the coffee can’t handle that it is the reason I had to buy another one I had some family members here for extended stay and they kept trying to get the last drop of coffee by pushing the button so hard it broke and started leaking so I had to buy another brewer but this time I got the extended warranty for it plus I have been using this type of coffee brewer for 15 years
"January 13, 2019",Michael Eisler,1.0,One,"The instructions talk about a tank and a reservoir. It is clear what the tank is. It is not clear what the reservoir is. The instructions say to pour the water from the tank into the reservoir. What is the point of filling the tank if the water is going to end up in the reservoir? The on/off and brew strength buttons are lose on the panel. Wiggle one and the other others. Same bad craftsmanship with the start time and keep warm hrs buttons. I am not a fan of coffee, and I am starting off hating this product."
"August 8, 2016",Ron M.,5.0,6,I bought the 48464 in 2009 and it is still going strong in 2016 so I could never ask for anything more. I bought another one last winter so I have a backup but it is still sitting in it's box awaiting use. I think I got my monies worth. Update July 2017: Still going strong so it might outlive me Still going strong Oct. 2017. Still working Jan 2019 (on/off light doesn't light anymore but still brews coffee)
"February 3, 2020",Mimi,1.0,,I LOVE THE PRODUCT AS A WHOLE UUT THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE PURCHASED AND THIS IS TWICE IT STOPPED WORKING ON ME .  THE FIRST ONE LAST OVER A YEAR BUT THIS ONE LASTED ONLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS .  IT MAKES A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE AND IS EASY TO USE BUT JUST DONT HOLD UP AND OF COURSE THE POLICY IS UP NOW ALWAYS MY LUCK.  I will never buy a Hamilton beech product again. Horrible customer service  amazon you guys rock gave refunding my money after two rounds of trying to get Hamilton beech to honor warranty.  Twice they have sent me a new maker without asking for the old one back but amazon refunded my money I sent original back before the two warranty ones came both product s from manufacturer have been broken.
"September 12, 2016",datsundriver,5.0,4," I have been using this machine for a month and I like it VERY MUCH. January 2018:  A year and a half later - still liking it. I had never used a brewstation before and it did take me a few days to get acquainted... it's different. Easy to clean, has programmable features, no carafe, doesn't drip, coffee tastes great, keeps warm on a programmable timer - this eliminates  ""burned"" coffee.  Makes Iced Coffee too but I have not tried this yet. Be aware that this unit is 15"" high - taller than the typical coffee maker - this could be a space consideration for some folks."
"May 3, 2019",Sheila,5.0,,"I bought this for our church.  It is mostly used by our janitors, kitchen staff and small groups who meet there.  The coffee tastes absolutely delicious (we used Folgers regular Columbian.)  I hope that the staff will clean it when needed, as I am not in that section of the parish that often.  I don't think it has been cleaned yet, and I cannot find the coffee cleaner in our local grocery store.  I have been wondering about getting a jug of white vinegar to leave near the pot, but I don't know if anyone will use it. (This is why I am ""neutral on ""easy to clean.""  I need to read the directions more thoroughly to learn if there is a  quick way to empty leftover coffee from the pot.  Right now, I simply drain it into cups.  All in all  this is a great machine so far and I would recommend it!"
"June 17, 2020",Bargain Shopper,3.0,,"This is my third time purchasing the same coffee maker. Here's what I like about it: - Compact size. - Sleek design. - Easy dispensing. - Keeps coffee warm for hours. - Good coffee flavor. - Affordable price. Here's what I don't like: - It only works for a year or so before it malfunctions and I need to replace it. This is with regular cleaning and daily use to full capacity. - It leaks like crazy from day one. I have to keep a super absorbent pad underneath it to save my counter from stains. - The spill tray is too small and flimsy. - Plastic parts become brittle over time and wear out quickly. Tip: For easy slide in and out from under cabinets, buy a small appliance caddy with wheels."
"April 8, 2021",funincolorado,5.0,,I absolutely love this coffee maker! I had this exact one for several years and I used it daily. It eventually just quit working but it lasted way longer than I ever thought it would! I did a Google image search and found this on Amazon and I was so excited! What I really like about this coffee maker is that you don’t have to worry about a dingy looking carafe that you need to wash all the time and it also keeps the coffee tasting really fresh. I just am one of those people that cannot drink coffee if it tastes old!! I love this coffee maker and when this one quits working I hope that I can buy another one just like it!
"October 25, 2018",lgee,3.0,2,"I like the 'no carafe' design.  I bought one of these about 2 years ago and the valve mechanism clogged, and is definitely  not easy to clean.  I took it apart and in normal handling one screw de-threaded i.e. it stripped the plastic threads it screwed into.  The replacement parts were reasonable but shipping was not (from the manufacturer).  So I decided it was economical to just replace it.  As I said the design is nice but there are durability issues.  Also if Hamilton Beach were to outfit it with a small LED light that comes on when you press the dispenser, that would go a long way toward better function i.e. you could see your coffee level in the cup in a 'morning' lighted room."
"February 21, 2021",S E,1.0,,"I have purchased several Hamilton Beach products over the years and have been impressed with them until after several months of owning this brew station. I purchased it after getting fed up replacing cracked carafes, and so I thought this was a perfect solution. I did not experience the slow flow problems that some described and when it worked OK the coffee tasted good and was hot, but I soon found some annoying issues and then had a major failure: 1. When the power goes off you have to reset the clock and programmed time, and the hour and minute buttons will change the clock any time they are pressed (i.e. there is no special protected mode to enter to set the clock, so when cleaning or moving the unit the buttons get accidently pressed and the time changes without you always noticing until your coffee does not brew at the desired time. 2. Water accumulates under the tank (as others described) due to condensation dripping down from the lid at the back of the unit. 3. The biggest issue just occurred last week - the brew station tank started leaking and it appeared to be coming from around the metal heat transfer plate. I read other posts about cleaning the valve and tightening the screws. I cleaned the valve and checked the screws but they were already tight, but it continued to leak all over my countertop. I decided to remove the heat transfer plate to check the seal beneath it which I found to be OK, but what I noticed was a tiny hairline crack in the base of the tank running from the edge of the cutout for the plate to the center screw hole at the back of the tank (see photos). Obviously there is no fix as I was not going to try glue or sealant in this area, and knowing it has one month left on the warranty I thought no problem I will contact Hamilton Beach and ask for a new tank. I checked their website and it says their customer support phone lines are closed due to COVID, so I submitted my request via the online form on the website. That was Tuesday Feb 16th, and today is Monday 22nd and they have not contacted me. It is concerning the product failed after 11 months and frustrating that Hamilton Beach doesn't seem bothered to provide customer support. I am currently looking for a better quality replacement from another manufacturer. UPDATE 12 March: After I posted my review on here HB contacted me later that day (on 22 February) and asked me to email them a copy of my receipt which I did and included some photos of the unit. On 24 February they notified me that they were sending me a new coffee maker and had waived the requirement to return the old unit to them and they waived the shipping charges.  I received the new coffee maker on 03 or 04 March and it has been working perfectly since. HB say their Customer Service is slower than normal due to the pandemic, which I can accept, but I cannot understand why they are not able to establish a telephone support line even with people working remotely. Many companies (mine included) have transition to working from home this past year. Anyway, despite the delay I am satisfied with the way they resolved it. The machine is working perfectly but the points I mentioned above could be redesigned to make this product better and more durable."
"December 24, 2020",David LHeureux,1.0,One,"The changes to this brew station are NOT improvements. I loved our old one, but the lever spring eventually gives out. SO, we bought the new one. FIRST flaw...you have to remove the entire assembly to add water. I don't like having the water reservoir coming up to the level of the heating element. I did see the picture that showed this, but didn't realize what was actually entailed. Next, when you push the lever, coffee comes coursing down the front of the machine...in addition to a stream into your cup. You have to have a towel on the counter every morning...or caarrreeefully puuusshhh ever so incrementally to get a dribble into your cup but avoid the waterfall feature behind and around the lever. COMPLETELY disgusted."
"February 2, 2016",Hensmama,3.0,3,"Love this coffeemaker! I had an older Brewstation that quit working after 8 years and bought this as a replacement. This one works well and makes really hot coffee and I like the keep warm feature that allows you to keep the coffee hot for up to 4 hours. Even if you let it keep warming a long time, the coffee never tastes scorched. Filter basket and reservoir are easy to remove to clean. Update 11/24/17..While I still love home fast this coffemaker brews coffee and the strength selector feature as well as the fact of having no carafe, it has developed an irritating problem with the push and serve button which leaks coffee into the reservoir which in turn causes coffee to pool underneath the coffeemaker to clean up besides wasting coffee. Because of this development I am changing my rating to 3 stars. The older version of this coffeemaker that I used for several years did not have this dripping problem."
"May 18, 2020",nate fischbach,2.0,,I bought this item a few weeks ago and it worked fine at first.  My family drinks a lot of coffee throughout the day so I was very happy that I can keep the coffee hot for 4 hours and also brew additional coffee when I’m running low without emptying the reservoir.  But just yesterday I noticed that there was coffee all over my counter.  I found that there was coffee collecting underneath the reservoir and it overflowed onto the counter.  I cleaned it up and just assumed it was do to condensation building up over weeks of use. Later that day I brewed another cup and noticed that there was more coffee again underneath the reservoir.  I investigated a found that the heating plate that is in the reservoir isn’t sealed properly and that is where the coffee is leaking from. I now see other people are having this same issue and probably needs to be addressed by the manufacturer. I contacted them today and hopefully there is a positive resolution.
"March 15, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,7,"Good Coffee Maker.  Worked well for a month or two. Within three months though, I thought I dedected that the ""keep warm"" function was not working as well as it did when the product first arrived. Now,the coffee is cold within an hour even when the warm function is indicating as on.  Brews hot, but then within half an hour you have to put the coffee in the microwave for a few to ""warm it up"".  At the four month mark, I am looking for a new coffee pot."
"January 16, 2020",Jeannie and Donn,3.0,,"We are on our fourth Brewstation.  I throw them away after 1-2 years as they get dirty like all coffee makers, but worse is they stop keeping the water hot.  I think the one I bought Dec 2019 is the hottest - in fact it keeps bubbling after the coffee is done.  My last one did that however that stopped after a couple months.  I believe the heating elements are either inferior or purposely designed to fade away.  Thankfully never had a leak, which seems to be the biggest complaint.  Be sure you do not get a REFURB/Return when you buy ANYTHING  from amazon.  You can tell, cut tape on box, tape over tape, plastic bag inside not right, electrical cord was retied unperfectly - send products like that immediately. I emailed  Jeff Bezos a few yeas back on this issue that Amazon and affiliates are selling things as new that are not NEW, and even spoke to his assistant.  Bottom line, it will never change, everything on sale is from countries producing crap quality. I do know these companies have issues getting things produced overseas, as I spoke to someone from HB on a different product issue, and he admitted it boldly.  But for 34 bucks for a new pot even every year, I'm still OK with buying them as long as this latest one does explode or something.  If that happens, surely there will be an update."
"July 16, 2021",Wayne Bernard,2.0,,"The function of the coffee maker is good, however the design is not so.  Difficult to pour water into and cleaning is also difficult without somewhat of a mess, two components are separate, grind and coffee reservoirs and have to be removed separately.  The coffee grind reservoir can not be removed at the same time as the coffee reservoir.  The issue it presents is when you remove the grind reservoir to empty, you end up with coffee that is still in the grinds dripping as you bring it to the sink. The handle for the coffee reservoir is under the grind reservoir so it can not be used to empty the pot of both reservoirs at the same time.  You also have some water that remains at the bottom of the base of the pot itself.  Think it may be from condensation that comes off the lid when open.  Have to turn the unit on it side to drain it. If I would have a do over I would consider the Hamilton Beach Model # 47950 which has the water reservoir on the side, instead of built into the unit."
"December 19, 2019",Goofy Gadget Guy,4.0,One,"The coffee maker is decent quality and dispensing concept is perfect since it eliminates the breakable carafe. But after a few months of use a loud buzzing noise started when the unit was turned on to brew. Apparently, this symptom is/was experienced by many people in their negative reviews but no solution was offered by either the manufacturer or the users. Well, I did my own investigation: the buzzing is due to condensed water being vaporized around the edges of the hot heating element. The condensed water accumulates from steam produced at the top, where the hot water is directed over the coffee basket, and dribbles down the back to end up in the bottom recesses. It's a design problem that the manufacturer didn't consider or didn't know how to fix. In lieu of a redesign solution, you will need to dump or sop up the water in the bottom chamber as part of the routine cleaning and maintenance."
"October 22, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I love the slender design of this. It fits well on my countertop in my small kitchen. It is the smallest of the non- K cup dispensers. The coffee is wonderful. It is never burnt and stays warm and fresh. Unfortunately, it started leaking after a year. It is such a mess. It also dispenses very slowly even after a cleaning. I can't find another suitable replacement. I ordered (and returned) the Cuisinart brew station as it is way too big for my space.  If only it didn't leak.....UPDATE I have reached out to Hamilton Beach customer service twice and no response. I am frustrated by both the leaking product and the lack of customer service. I will not be purchasing another coffee maker from Hamilton Beach."
"February 11, 2020",M. Fleming,4.0,,"This didn’t get all the stars for these reasons. This replaced the same type in Cuisinart. If the unit is moved at all after filling with water and before brewing it leaks on to the counter. (No it’s not overfilled). It also leaks just a drop or two after removing the filled cup. This is irritating, but I have to live with it if I am to keep this machine. Next, when the brewed coffee gets down to about four cups it is so hot you cannot drink it for ten minutes. Some folks may like that just short of boiling, I don’t. It is one more item to deal with. The brewed coffee is awesome! The machine is extremely easy to clean. With the timer set it is always ready to go in the morning."
"August 21, 2019",Aa. in NorCal,4.0,,"I replaced my 5 year old maker (same model) with the new one, I love the separated reservoir! and the iced coffee feature is nice too! This coffee maker is simple to use and very reliable in my experience. I use it every single day and my old one lasted 5 years. that's literally less than $0.03 a day! Add average cost for high quality coffee beans/bags bought in 5 years ... $0.40 a day for a grand total of $0.43 a day for a FULL carafe (or in this case reservoir) of coffee!!  Take that Starcrooks!! my ONLY beef with this model is it would be really great to have skid resistant feet on it! if its not against a wall it slides away from you while filling your cup... But, for the value I'll live with this inconvenience."
"December 14, 2020",Timothy J. Hartley,5.0,,We had to replace our old Mr. Coffee with something that was just as good and this has worked perfect.  No bulky odd shaped pitcher to clean.  Easy to see bright display.  We haven't done ice coffee yet but I'm sure we will this summer.  The only downside is somedays require a BIG coffee mug and the height is an issue but not a deal breaker.  We have used mostly bottled spring water to help keep it clean inside.  The water pitcher looks really good still.  The only downside I see is that there is a burned coffee stain on the metal plate that transfers heat from the maker base to the 'coffee pot'  It doesn't seem to be getting any worse so I think it is just the hottest point of the plate.  We leave it on from 2 to 4 hours almost every day (now going on 2 months) and usually less than 4 cups for most of that time.  Overall very pleased and very deserving of 5 stars.
"August 6, 2019",Mysti,4.0,,"I’ve had my brew station for 3 weeks now and I’m really loving it! The removable water reservoir is easy to reattach (I returned a different coffee maker cuz the reservoir was hard to put on)... it’s really easy to program and the coffee comes out super hot. Some reviewers said it’s loud but I haven’t noticed that... it does sound faintly as if the coffee might be bubbling slightly but it’s not loud at all and doesn’t affect the taste. The top lid does collect a lot of condensation, but it all goes into the coffee reservoir so it’s not an issue. All in all, I’m quite pleased with this brew station. I really love the look and not having a carafe"
"June 3, 2017",ZanyMomofFour,5.0,5,"Bought this on the amazon warehouse deals, and it is just awesome. I had a much older model which started to leak after many years of trustworthy service. I was glad to have found a newer model and for a great price. It is fantastic to be able to fill up larger mugs and tall to go mugs. My coffee stays hot for as long as I set it for without scorching or burning. I especially like the detachable part which you fill with water, instead of having to stretch the faucet over. I took a chance on the amazon warehouse part, but only the box was slightly squashed, and the coffee maker was perfect inside. Can't wait to try the iced coffee feature when it gets hot this summer."
"July 9, 2021",Mielchica,4.0,,"I am delighted with my Hamilton Beach BrewStation! The other colors were twice the price but at $30something bucks I wasn’t going to worry abt color. I love that it can be programmed to brew and stay hot for up to 4 hrs. It’s a tad bothersome that the base where you add fresh water doesn’t have the cup amount markings on the side.  I add my water directly to that reservoir instead of where the brewed coffee sit as the directions instruct you to do first to measure , then pour into reservoir. It’s an added step I rather not do to avoid any spilling. I actually fill and pour from my 20oz water bottle so I know I’m making abt 4 servings of coffee… but yeah that’s the only thing that caught my attention with this design. But I am a happy customer (~¿~)"
"November 30, 2018",Milonius K. Entwhistle,1.0,,"I originally wrote a mildly positive review about this coffeemaker after a month or so of use. I came back here to change it because the coffeemaker has become worthless to me after 3 months or so of use. I thought it would be a cool idea to switch from a glass carafe to a dispenser type model, but that just didn't turn out to be true. One day after I got home from work there was a bit of coffee puddled around the coffee maker, which I assumed to be a spill from either my wife and I, so I didn't think much of it. The next day, however, I came home to a flood of coffee all over the countertop. Turns out it had been leaking from the dispenser section. It seeped into the seam of my laminate countertops and caused the particle board underneath to become ruined. After looking in the owners manual, which I probably should have done from day one, I determined that leaking is a symptom of the coffeemaker needing to be cleaned and that the manufacturer recommends cleaning every month or so. My bad, I hadn't cleaned it in 3 months. I promptly cleaned it with vinegar as the directions stated, and guess what? It had a major leak the next morning. We have really hard water where I live, seeing as that we are in the desert, but I don't think that should preclude us from using this coffeemaker. I think that this is simply a poor design choice on the part of the manufacturer, and it's caused us a great deal of annoyance and cost. I rent the house I live in, and the damaged countertop is going to have to be reckoned with at some point. I'll have to pay the cost to have it replaced. This purchase was a bad idea. We are now back to using our junky old carafe model."
"January 11, 2020",Ashley,5.0,,"Best coffee maker I've owned,  if course  not expert though. I've owned a few regular drip machines with the carafe  and one keurig,  the basic model that you can get at Walmart for $59. I loved that the keurig made my. Coffee right then and there when I wanted,  AFTER  it healed up and I refilled the water if it needed it.  And I couldn't really. Choose the strength of the coffee without sacrificing. Size of my cup.  I'm sire other models are different but I don't want to spend over $50 on a coffee maker so that was pushing it plus the pods are Expensive  compared to bying it ground by the pound I absolutely love this machine though.  Yes,  there's a few minor annoyance,  like any machine. Really it's just that I have the thing under my counter  so to lift the lid all the way to clean or fill it up I have to pull it out from under.  That doesn't really bother me at all though.  That's really it for coma on it in my opinion though. It looks stylish.  I love that the water tank comes out to fill,  I love that the coffee reservoir has a basket. Handle to make it easier. To clean,  I love how simple it is to work and program.  I love that my coffee is waiting for me in the morning,  no matter what.  It comes out cooler than the keurig did but it's the perfect tempature in my opinion.  I little hot at first but that's good.  I read some reviews complaining about filling thick or large mugs? I haven't had am issues and I have some ridiculous mugs,  some of which are LARGE..... And thick..  Haha So I don't think you have to worry.  The drip trays a little small,  but it does its job.  It's also really awesome that there's an iced. Coffee feature. I worked at a Dublin donuts in high school so I know it's not made the Dr way and K love that this machine is able to make iced coffee.  It really is so so. Please bjt stylish,  and it does its job perfectly.  Overall its the best machine I've ever owned or have seem put of friends and familys.  I highly recommend!"
"July 10, 2020",S. D. Laughary,1.0,,I liked the concept of this coffeemaker and decided to give it a try. From the very first time it leaked coffee down the front of machine and onto counter. I tried tightening screws and trying to figure out if there was a way to fix it. I believe it is just a design flaw on the lever that opens the valve to dispense coffee. Still I liked the concept and spent too much time trying to make it work. Finally I asked for a replacement But it was 2-3 days beyond the return date and seller did not allow. So I went with the manufacturer warranty and they sent me a new unit that performed the same or even worse. I’ve had enough cleaning of the counter under the appliance. I just asked for a refund and was told they couldn’t unless I had purchased the item directly from them. Now I have 2 leaking machines! I bought a Cuisinart and have to say these people can make a good coffee maker. Don’t even try with this HB model! Nothing but a mess!!
"March 31, 2020",JANICE E SCHULTZ,1.0,,"This is perhaps the worst coffee maker we have ever had.  When we fill the reservoir with enough water to brew 8 cups of coffee it will brew two cups and leave 6 in the reservoir and other times it will brew 6 cups and leave 2 in the reservoir.  It's spastic you never know how many cups of coffee you will end up with.  Maybe twice in the last two months we have actually gotten 8 cups of coffee and emptied the reservoir.  Oh yes, we clean the filter, run vinegar through it, then run the brew cycle once and it comes back with the ""clean"" recommendation once again.  No way would I recommend this to anyone."
"August 18, 2016",JennK,3.0,17,"I love this updated Hamilton Beach coffee maker. My previous model, purchased in 2009 was great, but I love this one even more. PROS: - I love that this is easy to use with both travel cups and regular coffee cups. - A huge and well applauded update from the previous model is where you pour in the water. I love the easy to read water ""cup"" markings and that opening is very large to pour water in. I only use the hose on my faucet (as opposed to filling coffee basin and carefully pouring in that amount of water).  This makes filling up the water so much easier. - I like the ""clean"" reminder, this is very helpful to remind me to do my monthly cleaning. - The four hour ""keep warm"" function is great. I love that we program a 6:00am brew start time and it will still be warm at 7:00am (until 10:00am) if we wake up later. - I haven't used the ""brew strength"" function but it seems like a great option. CONS: - the rubber grips on the bottom of the coffee maker are easily popped off by any slight movement of the coffee pot. - Update: October 2018 We have had this coffee pot less than 3 years and the coffee while brewed and Setting will leak Into the water reservoir- thus requiring and good cleaning of the coffee pot and many dumps before it’s ready to setup for the next pot of coffee. Warranty is only one year, but Hamilton Beach was willing to offer me a discount on a new coffee pot of my choosing. I will be re-ordering this same model as we love it, fingers crossed it doesn’t break in a couple years."
"June 24, 2021",John Martinez,1.0,,"Just walk away from this thing, you get what you pay for, if that.  This thing does not make my morning great.  The filter basket which sits on top of the coffee tank that needs to be lifted off is constantly wet underneath, even when cool and drips everywhere.  Filling the coffee tank with water and then pouring it to the machine is a process, with no real easy way to dump it in without spilling it or taking a methodical slow path.  Should you actually succeed, when filling a cup and not having it in the exact position coffee will pour down the back of the cup and you need to have this against a wall or it will slide when trying to get some,  I burned myself by stupidly putting my hand over the top to hold it in place..  Forbid that you actually drink all the coffee and want to make more while the machine is still warm because pulling stuff out while it's hot is a scalding process and not fun and gets even more drippy coffee everywhere from the filter basket just buy a normal coffee maker with a pot at this price point."
"September 8, 2019",Babe,4.0,One,"I have been using this for 6 months now and overall I’m happy I made the switch from Keurig. However, as other reviews have stated, this is a very tall top loading unit that I need to pull out from under the cabinets each time I use it. It is also not very easy to clean with many crevices inside each chamber. Finally it does actually burn the coffee if you let the coffee level gets to about one cup. As a busy mom I do appreciate that I can re-warm my coffee by topping off my cup with fresh coffee all morning, and I don’t have an unsightly pot sitting around dirty when things get wild and I don’t have time to clean. Also being able to regulate my own coffee to water ratio was much appreciated after going through 3 Keurig pods a morning just to get enough caffeine."
"April 27, 2021",Teri Lee,5.0,,"This is the 3rd coffeemaker I have purchased this year. The first one was a single cup maker and the coffee splashed everywhere when it poured into the cup. Plus you have to go through the whole process as if you were making a pot of coffee in miniature every cup! My second didn't stay on long enough. Then I got this coffeemaker and it is perfect for me. It stays on for 4 hours! There is no external glass pot. It is the easiest coffeemaker I have ever used, and the easiest one to have hot coffee when you want it! I highly recommend this coffeemaker and I would definitely buy it again."
"June 29, 2021",Missus MacLeod,1.0,,"I bought my first Hamilton Beach brew station years and years ago. It was a sturdy unit. It was made of thick plastic and it worked forever. So when I decided to buy another BrewStation I was expecting the same quality and I was greatly disappointed. It is so flimsy!! Thin plastic and cheap parts. And now, after only three months, the coffee pot has stopped working altogether. At first it would brew a little bit and then stop. I’ve cleaned it repeatedly. Now it just won’t brew at all. It’s no longer eligible for return. Amazon has been zero help. Hamilton Beach has been zero help. So now I’ve had to purchase another coffee pot. Buyer beware."
"May 7, 2020",cheryl vandermyde,3.0,,"I needed a decent programmable coffeemaker, something that my birds (yes, you read that right) can't get into. This, though? A bit complicated for a coffeepot. 3 different things to wash/rinse/fill...and all parts beneath coffee reservoir must be dry, or you will hear sizzling of water; Hot/metal piece burns coffee grounds to it, need to be scraped off. then there's the gigantic water reservoir. I mean, it's TOO BIG and cumbersome for an average kitchen counter. Just not what I expected. No one wants to play around with their coffeemakers this much. Other than the fact that it does make a great cup of coffee, it's just too much bother, really."
"November 4, 2017",Jimmie Roan,2.0,,"Actually, we loved this coffee maker. Even bought my daughter one. I just hope hers lasts a lot longer. Coffee made in this maker comes out smoother and less bitter. This was our 2nd Brewstation. The first one lasted over 2 years, until someone dropped the removable reservoir. I'm not sure what the problem with this particular brewstation was. About 8 months after we bought it, the coffee pour slowed way down. As best we could tell, the filter in the removable reservoir was clogged up. So I decided to clean it. Yeah, not much chance of that since the cover is riveted in. We put up with the slow pour for a couple more months, but decided enough was enough. I realize everything is made to be disposable, but seriously? A filter that can't be cleaned? What engineer had that bright idea? Filters get dirty and have to be cleaned or replaced. Or, of course, you can just throw away the whole coffee maker. Doesn't make a lot of sense. By all means, buy this coffee maker if you don't mind buying a new one in less than a year."
"March 19, 2021",robert rule,1.0,,This is the third Hamilton Beach coffee maker I've owned over the last 15-20 years. The first one was like this except it didn't have the removable water tank. That lasted up until 2018. The second was basically the same as the first but lasted a little over a year before it took a dump. I bought this model because I liked the removable water tank feature. I really wanted to love this coffee maker but I've had leaking problems from the get go. The tank that holds the coffee has leaked since I first used it. I've been able to fix it by tightening the screws where the heat element is but it's finally gotten to the point that no longer works. I've woken up 2 days in a row to half of the coffee all over my counter......Not happy and never buying Hamilton Beach products again
"February 5, 2019",Tony in Idaho,1.0,One,"My first unit lasted 18+ months, but would constantly leak water on the counter from the bottom of the unit. It finally fried the electronics. I liked the unit so I thought I would get another. I purchased it in November 2018. When it arrived one of the pins that holds the lid on the reservoir was sheared off so the lid does not hinge. It was this way on the 1st unit I purchased also. I decided to overlook this as too busy to gripe at Amazon. Within a month the unit would stop brewing about half way through the cycle although it would remain on and warm. If you shut off and turn on it finishes. Before the end of the day the brewed coffee will begin to leak out of unit and now the fresh water is leaking from the bottom again. Will attempt to cal Hamilton. Missed Amazon's return window by 5 days"
"September 8, 2015",TRR5,4.0,5,"Pros *Very easy to set up and use *Simple, intuitive controls *Brews a good pot of coffee *Easy cleaning as far as dispenser models go Cons *The fact that you can buy a two-pack from Amazon tells you how durable they are Other Thoughts Let's face it, drip coffee makers are all about convenience. If you want the best cup of coffee out there, you should be using a French press or a stove-top espresso maker. But most people just want a quick cup or three in the morning without all that time and effort. If you're in that category, then this is an excellent coffee maker for you (until it breaks). If you're not familiar with carafe-less coffee makers, there is no pot to lift and pour. You just push your mug up against a lever and the coffee dispenses like those soda machines in fast-food chains. So easy! If you *are* familiar with carafe-less coffee makers, you know they can be a pain to set up and clean. But Hamilton Beach has come a long way with its designs. This one has a detachable reservoir: just take it to the sink, fill it, and then put it back in place. A big improvement over the old ones! The tank where the brewed coffee sits also detaches so it's easy to clean. The coffee brews well as far as drip machines go. Obviously, the quality and the quantity of the beans make a big difference, but if you're moving up from a glass pot, you won't be disappointed. We often use Mystic Monk beans and the coffee is only a bit short of heavenly (you need a French press to get all the way there). The only downside to this machine is that you can tell Hamilton Beach is skimping on durability to keep the price down. I'd much rather pay an extra $20 for quality electronics that last, but so be it. Our first one made it through nine months of 1-2 pots per day before short-circuiting. My wife and I talked it over and decided it's still worth the money to order a second one."
"March 3, 2016",PandaV,5.0,4,"Nice machine, does what it's supposed to and thats feed my coffee addiction! I prep the coffee the night before and have the timer brew it so its ready when we finally crawl out of bed each morning. I like that it has a ding that goes off when the coffee is fully brewed. I also like that if you don't pour water in to the machine but press the on button you see a message that tells you to add water. When I first got the machine it had the nasty plastic smell to it and it did ""leak"" into the taste of the coffee, I solved that by cleaning the machine with lemon juice and then rinsing it with water until no lemon scent was left. I read that the plastic smell and/or taste happens because the machine is so newly made and boxed up that it hasn't had time to dissipate. Once cleaned with the lemon juice we have no plastic smell or taste in the coffee. I read in other reviews that the coffee went warm or cold when left to keep warm for about an hour, I've left coffee for the 4 hour keep warm timer and it was still hot, just had that left on the warmer for too long taste, normally we have drunk the whole pot within 2 hours and 2 hours on the warmer it still tastes fresh. Yes there is minimal ""leaking"" from the machine, it happens if the water is not poured in at the right angle or poured in too fast, and also when the lid is opened some of the condensation will drip down the back. Its something that happens with just about EVERY machine. It does not make puddles like some people say, if they are getting puddles then it's from user mistakes or a faulty machine. You can fit a full sized travel mug or thermos under the spout, all you have to do is remove the drip tray and bring the machine close to the edge of the counter, put the over sized mug or thermos under the spout and let it fill."
"May 20, 2020",Jennifer Watson,4.0,,Updated review... This coffee maker still rocks a year later.. I did lower the review because of how much of a hassle it is to clean properly.  I like how it is coffee on demand.  I wish there was a way to reheat it in this device. After breaking too many Carafets - I absolutely love this coffee maker and wish that I knew about it earlier. It is extremely easy to use however cleaning has not been as easy as I would like. I like that the reservoir to put the water in is extremely large so I do not worry about spilling water getting into a small place. It keeps the coffee warm for several hours. It is really easy to push the button and go I have not tried to pre-program it yet but I can see it being fairly simple. I would recommend it to anyone with how great it is.
"April 17, 2016",Rick Kowalewski,2.0,One,"Good quality.  Bought this to replace an old Cuisinart -- I loved the design, but then it leaked overnight all over our wood counters.  The Hamilton Beach works fine, with a few caveats. 1.  It's complicated to prepare the coffee.  You have to remove the upper chamber with the basket in it, empty to coffee grounds and filter from the basket, pour out any remaining coffee in the upper chamber, then fill the chamber with the amount of water you want to use, then pour that water from the chamber to the reservoir in the machine, set the upper chamber in place, then put the basket back in the chamber, put the filter and coffee in the basket, close it all up and set to timer (or on if you want it right away). 2.  A minor issue ... it's sometimes hard to see how much coffee is filling your cup if you're using a tall cup like a travel mug.  You have to keep checking to make sure you get enough but not too much. 3.  The machine seems to think it needs to be cleaned every few weeks -- another complicated process with vinegar, brewing, then water, then brewing, then finally ready to use. Coffee tastes good, but I expected that.  I wavered between 2-3 stars, because I am OK with this coffee maker, but don't really like it a lot."
"June 29, 2021",cmlvngstn,1.0,,"I have been purchasing Hamilton Beach Brew Stations for my three home for the past 20+ years. If this new model is what they will continue to sell, I will no longer buy them. This is flimsy, measurements of water container and coffee holder are not equal, it is so lightweight I have to hold the device stable to get the coffee. On several occasions this has caused me to bun my hand because it is poorly insulated. The water container does not fully empty out, making the coffee too strong. The machine does not keep the coffee hot. I hate this machine. I want the old model back."
"October 13, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,We have always used Hamilton Beach Brew Station for years. We were always happy with them until a few tears ago. The quality gets worse with every one we buy. They used to last for a long time. Now you are lucky to get maybe two years out of them if you do the maintenance on it and keep them clean. This model came and did not even have rubber feet on the front to keep it from sliding on the cabinet top. I bought self sticking bumpers to put on the bottom to keep it from sliding around. It just feels cheap. I guess the CEO needed more millions so they cut corners lol. Probably have to go with a different brand next time.
"July 18, 2017",Beth Kowal,3.0,One,"I needed a new coffee maker when we moved, and this seemed convenient as I take a travel mug of coffee with me to work everyday. Maybe it's just me, but I've been having some trouble getting the proportions of water and coffee to my liking (was never an issue with my old, standard coffee maker). My boyfriend also takes a travel mug with him... his is one of those hot/cold bottles that narrows at the top. It is a PAIN to get coffee into this thing - it's too tall to maneuver it into the right spot and even when you think you're good, you're off and coffee gets everywhere. I've also overfilled this bottle countless times. If you just go for a regular mug or simple travel mug - you should be fine. He and I both love that tall bottle, though... so I guess we'll just have to deal with it."
"March 4, 2021",Richard D George,5.0,,"Over the years, I've owned just about every type of coffee maker there is, and this is one of the most convenient and easy to clean and use ones that I've had..The filter basket and coffee tank lift right out.  The coffee tank can be used to fill with the correct amount of water and pour that in the water tank..but I prefer a separate water pitcher.  Getting used to just putting my coffee mug under the spout and filing it took about 3 minutes..and I no longer have to deal with the carafe and lid.  Easy to set time, beverage strength, how many hours to keep the coffee warm, etc..and makes a decent cup.  I'd buy another for sure."
"April 15, 2020",Lindo,1.0,,Ok very disappointing from Hamilton beach Brew station. First off this is my second one I like the idea of making so much and filling up my cup! I program it and it turns on but the water in the reservoir doesn’t move thru the coffee just sits there! I clean and do all that work to program and still 1 out of 6 times it works! Then I clean and this time unplug and when I want coffee I pig in and I hear it making so I go do something to find it’s just sitting there still on but not water moves thru the coffee pot do now I turn it off and start it back up and I wait while it’s working and 1 out 5 times it works!! Ugh! Fed up
"March 30, 2017",Jackie C,5.0,2,"We were needing a new coffee pot and I figured I'd wait until the stores are over-saturated at Christmas and use coffeemakers as ""loss leaders"" (who wants to spend money on themselves during the holiday!?)  In the interim, I checked Amazon to see what was on the market and what pricing was running and came across this deal.  What?  No pot for me to break?!  But that's why I bought the previous pot from Starbucks (the metallic pot that after years of use had umpteen dents from my early morning depth perception (if having one's eyes still half shut counts as a depth perception blunder lol).  I have to say, I absolutely LOVE it.  And if I make a pot during the week and not finish it, I can rewarm it in the pot and it doesn't have that crappy burned/rewarmed taste.  And don't tell me to just microwave it because that somehow changes the flavor of coffee.  Not this system.  Husband and I love it.  Another thing I love about it is that it makes right at a half gallon of coffee, so the husband and I don't fight over who gets the second or third cup - we both get it.  Amazon had spectacular pricing on this (their own version of a loss leader as the 12 cup version was less expensive than the smaller quantity version).  After having this pot for a year, I still catch myself reaching for the pot to fill my cup (old dog/new tricks) and stick any one of the dozen different types of cups to fill'er up.  Absolutely no issue there.  We have seen a little issue with overfill leaks but that's my fault for not using the pot's system rather than an old tupperware pitcher.  We love, love this coffee maker.  And it makes an EXCELLENT pot of coffee, consistently.  Sorry so wordy - but those people who complained about their machines?  Nah, no issue here."
"October 28, 2019",Marianne,2.0,,"I really love the way this machine makes coffee.  HOWEVER,  I bought this one to replace my old one with the round buttons when the cord actually melted.  I bought this one on December 13, 2018.  Today is October 28, 2019, not even a year and I've been having trouble with the new style rectangular power button.  I'd hit the button to shut it off and it would come back on after a second or two.  The past couple days, I'd hit the button and the power light would come on, but nothing happened.  I unplugged it and examined the power button only to see that it's actually cracked in half.  This is a 2 adult household so there's no kids hitting things and I usually make the coffee in the morning.  I'm torn because this brewstation makes the best cup of coffee I've ever had at home, but I didn't even get a year out of this model. :("
"October 5, 2016",Peanut1964,4.0,2,"I'm still on the fence about this coffee maker. It's fast, which I like - my last one took about 30 min to brew 12 cups. This one takes about 10. I like not having a carafe. Clumsy hands in this house have broken 3 in the last 2 years lol. However, I think what I'm not completely satisfied with is the basket. This may sound stupid, but it drips (a lot!)  when I take it out of the coffeemaker. My trash bin is at the other end of the counter and I have to cover the bottom with my hand or paper towels to get it there to dump the grounds. My sink is right next to the coffeemaker but I don't have a disposal, plus I'm on a septic system and I don't know if it's ok to dump them down the drain anyway. Will have to google that. Another slightly annoying thing is the cup label on the inside of the coffee maker. Every one I've ever had, I fill it to the top of the cup label. This seems to be opposite. If I fill it to the top of the 12 cup mark, the water comes out the back through the overflow slit. When it's finished brewing I do not have 12 cups...more like 10."
"December 18, 2019",S V,5.0,,"We are self-employed hobby farmers. Coffee is important to get moving in the morning. We aren't fancy. We like to produce as little waste and possible. We don't need bells and whistles and we have no interest or desire to pay a gazillion dollars for a machine to just make coffee. This machine fits the bill perfectly. We bought a former version a few years ago and when that one bit the dust, I was pleased to see it still offered as an affordable option. No carafe means one less thing to have to clean. The removable water reservoir makes filling it super easy in an early morning stupor. I am sure setting it up the night before and using the timer would be lovely, but I am honestly not that organized. This machine is a easy yes. (It even was delivered a day earlier than I thought it would be which made me almost as happy as morning coffee.)"
"March 20, 2021",Ssica,1.0,,"I purchased this is November 2020 to replace one of the exact same that I purchased in October 2019 that stopped working.  We really liked the design of this coffee pot and assumed the old one quit because we weren’t diligent about cleaning it. Right out of the box, it leaks from behind the lever.  I do the right thing and email Hamilton Beach, they send an identical replacement that also leaks the exact same way.  I email them again and they offer to let me choose a different model, but then sent a different model from the one I chose.  One that is a lot cheaper than this one.  So I ended up buying a different brand of coffee maker."
"August 20, 2015",JannyP,4.0,6,"This is my third purchase of this style and brand of coffee maker.  Wore out the first one, the second one with the water pot on the side did not keep the coffee hot and had an odd look. This one works well, but when left on, it makes a lot of noise while keeping the coffee hot.  It gurgles and groans, which is odd.  You certainly get HOT coffee though, which is necessary for a good cup.  I keep purchasing these because I don't like the glass carafe, and the coffee doesn't get that burned, overcooked taste.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the noise level brings it down to a 4."
"December 31, 2015",Elise Esclave,2.0,3,"I am very disappointed in this product.  It worked ok for the first few months, and I was impressed at the programmable feature and the pressing of the cup and pouring the desired amount into it feature as well, but the actual quality of the coffee has become worse and worse, and there are times when it pours the coffee around itself, making spills.  This is a typical American product of the 21 century: built to look pretty and impressive, but actual craftsmanship is crap, the results are unimpressive, and is built to be replaced shortly.  Overall, it was a waste of money.  This was the first time I switched from my Mr. Coffee that cost me $15 or so 10 years ago, which despite being a simple machine, produced coffee faithfully for 10 years, and my lesson has been, if you truly want a good coffee maker, you need to spend the bucks for it.  Otherwise, stick to the $20 dollar Mr. Coffee.  Everything else is a waste of time.  The only reason why I gave it two stars is because, surprisingly, the thing still works.  This is because I take care of my stuff, expecting it to take care of me."
"August 15, 2016",Lisa,5.0,One,"I love this coffee maker and my husband does, too! The internal brewing system is very cool. It doesn't take long to brew the coffee and you can dispense hot coffee until it's gone. What is it about dispensing coffee that makes it so fun to use?! Anyway, I'm getting a kick out of it, but I'm a working mom with not much going on in my life. Coffee is important :) The clock is easy to set and I had no trouble programming this machine so that I have coffee ready in the am. I unplug my coffee maker when not in use, so I don't generally use this feature, but I did do this the first day. It was sooooo nice to wake up to coffee. Why do I not keep this up? I don't know. Fear of burning the house down, I guess. The machine is easy to fill with water and fill with coffee. Filling the machine with coffee is much like all the other coffee makers that I have had, but the water is a bit different. You just take the bucket off of the coffee maker, fill it with water, and then pour into the machine. Once finished, put the bucket back. It's part of the machine. It looks nice on my counter and the warm setting is great because I can gradually finish the whole pot (I know...I know)."
"October 15, 2018",RYAN,2.0,One,I really wanted to love this coffee maker and did for the first 3 months. It was so nice to have the coffee stay warm. (I wake up very early with a baby and it was nice to have the coffee ready when I woke and still hot on the 3rd cup). Since then I have battled with the dispenser. the O ring kept failing and coffee constantly drips out of the dispenser as it sits on the counter. I first found this when I used the morning timer and came downstairs to find coffee all over my counter and floor. I've gotten by for a few months with just sticking a mug under it to catch the dripping (wasting about a cup of coffee per pot). Then the sping on the dispenser came loose because I went to brew a put and coffee just came pouring out. I turned it off but burned myself trying to stop the stream and clean up the mess. I also find it difficult to thoroughly clean the machine and container. I've dealt with the faulty pot for a few months partially because of laziness and partially because I spent good money on this one that I wanted it to work for more than a few months. Frustrating.
"February 1, 2020",Thomas Roach,5.0,,"Slime molds grow on any surface that stays wet. This coffee maker is worth the additional cost just for having a reservoir that can be washed in the sink! The ""Bold"" setting actually works although I use far less than the recommended amount of grounds. The coffee dispenses at a lower temperature than a carafe--cool enough to drink immediately without scalding (at least while using ""Bold""). Note that the ""Program"" button is bright enough to serve as a night-light and the decanter coffee level gauge faces to the right where it can't be seen in a corner."
"October 2, 2015",Amy,5.0,One,"OMG what is with the people complaining about LEAKING?  You have an electronic machine create HOT WATER under a lid, and you lift the lid, of COURSE water will leak!  It's called chemistry.  But it doesn't LEAK, it's just condensation under the lid that, I find, drips back down into the machine, NOT ON MY COUNTER.  I really don't understand the issue here. I bought this because for the third time I cracked my glass Melitta carafe.  I was concerned because I love to make a full 12-cup pot of coffee at night and then pour it all into a pitcher and refrigerate the pitcher and have iced coffee for three days.  Could I do that with this plastic insert filled with coffee that's probably not meant to be poured into a pitcher? YES OMG YES.  I was afraid the plastic insert would be to heavy or to hot or just too difficult to pour into a pitcher, but not at ALL. Five times now I've made a full machine of coffee.  When it went DING I pulled the plug, lifted the lid, and shook the filter compartment and waited for any leftover liquid/coffee to dribble into the plastic holder. Ten minutes later I come back and remove the filter compartment...then remove the whole 12-cup holder of coffee and easily pour it into a pitcher, let it cool, and put the pitcher in the fridge for three days' worth of coffee (my 16-oz travel mug actually holds four cups of brewed coffee, no matter what the machine). How does it taste?  With my Melitta I've always selected BOLD, poured in a full pot of water (same amount as with this machine, what they call 12 cups) and added 12 scoops of coffee.  After my first pot with this machine (also on BOLD) I learned that the scoops should be juuuust over level.  My first pot was bitter because my scoops were TOO much over level.  For me (I HAAAAAAATE weak coffee but hate bitter as much) 12 scoops just over level plus an extra tiny pinch at the end makes for PERFECT.  I mean this coffee is PERFECT.  Just as good as my Melitta. In the end, I ended up ordering a new glass carafe so in about a week I'm going to have this wonderful machine AND my Melitta 12-cup machine back in business.  Now I just need to find 23 people to come over for my 24 cups of coffee I can now make!  :)"
"May 3, 2020",Dmon,4.0,,"We had an older model of this coffee maker and it lasted a log time and worked well.  This is why we purchased a new version of old coffee maker.  The design is nice, coffee tastes good, some nice new features also, like the higher spout that can handle a taller cup.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the noise it makes when you leave the heating element turned on to keep the coffee hot.  The older model did not make any noise.  Also it appears that it does not hold quite as much coffee as the older model.  Besides these two issues, its a nice coffee maker.  You don't have to deal with a coffee pot, since it holds the coffee inside the machine."
"January 17, 2021",MBFS,2.0,,"Purchased this as a replacement for same model that is now 5 years old.  (Noticed sloughing of plastic inside heating chamber and figured it was time for a new unit)  Although I had read some reviews about leaking, I still went ahead with the updated unit based on past personal experience.  Sorry to say that the reviews, warning about leakage, were correct.  They changed the valve/actuator through which coffee is dispensed to increase the flow and thereby reduce the time required to fill your mug.  Unfortunately, the new rate of flow appears to overwhelm the plastic housing and causes ""collateral"" leakage.  The only way around this is to not press the dispenser bar all the way, thereby reducing the flow rate and thus eliminating the ""splash effect"" altogether.  After several weeks of dealing with it, I decided to return the unit and reinstall the older one."
"October 27, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"This is my Third and Last Brew Station.  It was by far the noisiest but when I called the make to be sure it wasn't just overheating was told the one in their lounge was just a loud and wasn't a safety problem.  Should have sent if back then. About a month ago it began to occasionally leak after the first cup was poured. It's never pretty when you come home and the entire counter is covered in coffee. I have hard water and just thought maybe I'm not cleaning enough but that didn't solve the problem. Got worse.  Just bought something different so I thought I'd disassemble it to see what the problem was and see if it could be fixed before going off to Goodwill. (still assuming my very hard water, even though I filtered it was was the problem).  No calcification at all.  I am pretty certain it is in the design.  It's an odd diaphragm and star design and seems bound to fail if anything gets off center.  It's not going to Goodwill, not foisting this off on anyone. But alas the loss of a loyal customer."
"December 29, 2020",Tom,1.0,,"This was our third Hamilton Beech Brew Station. The first one started leaking on the counter after about 6 months. We replaced it and after a few months, it started dribbling coffee down the front and onto the counter. The dispenser didn't’ shut off completely. We replaced  it on Nov 25 and on Nov 26 we made our first pot of coffee. It began leaking immediately onto the counter. Every day we had to clean the counter and the grout lines between the tiles. I guess we are slow learners because we kept buying the same product thinking the manufacturer would correct the problem. They haven’t. The idea is great. You can brew a pot of coffee and then dispense it one cup at a time-no carafe necessary. But it leaks! I repeat-it LEAKS. We even purchased the extended protection. Both coffee maker and protection were returned for a refund. Do not buy unless you enjoy cleaning up coffee leaks all over your counter."
"May 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I was very disappointed in this coffee maker. It looks sleek on the counter but that’s about all the praise I can give it. When filling this up with water it’s almost impossible to do it without getting water everywhere. Also when removing the filter part of the maker it drips and unless you put something under it it will be all over the floor from the counter to the garbage. We use travel mugs for our morning coffee, you can not get one of these under the pot to fill as they are to tall and you end up getting coffee everywhere. Unless you are using just a regular coffee cup you will not be able to fill it easily. Disappointed I spent over $50 on an appliance that just sits on the counter as we will definitely be replacing this one right away!"
"January 2, 2018",Teri B.,2.0,4,"The concept of this coffee maker is nice but it turned out to have several issues.  First and foremost,  the first cup of coffee was lukewarm, not hot at all.  The machine is constantly making noise to keep up trying to get the coffee hot.  The other issue I found was that it doesn't stay in place when trying to dispense the coffee.  You have to literally hold on to the unit.  I also found that the water condensation just makes a mess when you open the lid to make coffee.  I have had my older Hamilton Beach coffee maker for about 3yrs and it has been fine until the warming plate now seems to not be working properly.  Returning it after only 3 days..."
"January 1, 2020",Marti & Eloy,1.0,,"Not a fan. Makes a decent tasting cup relatively fast, but that's about all. Didnt come with the rubber feet so you have to hold the back and risk burning your hand. Hard to see the cup you are filling so you have to stop filling it over and over. Only works for basic cups,  all our travel cups were too tall so you have to slide it to the edge of the counter to fit them. Finally, the setting that is supposed to keep your coffee warm quickly brings it to a rolling boil, so its scorched within 20 minutes or so. If I could send it back I would."
"July 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I bought one of these  coffee makers as my sister had one at a rental cottage and it was easy to use. My only complaint is that it is largely kind of thin plastic so I'm hoping that if I'm very careful I'll let a few years out of it before it falls apart. It's easy to use and easy to clean which is good. Back of it needs to be held when you dispense coffee due to its' lightweight design so I use a dishtowel to hold it in place. No coffee gets left in the brewed part if you dispense it all, in other words , no residue is left which is good."
"July 14, 2020",Rachael S,1.0,One,"I’ve used this same model for the past 8 years. They usually last a year before they start leaking from the bottom. I’ve bought 3 of these in the last couple of weeks and I’ve returned each time because of the SAME PROBLEM!  When getting coffee by pushing in the dispenser, it leaks from the button on the bottom.  So, I’m officially done with this model. I’m so disappointed, but I believe there is a design flaw."
"December 7, 2019",B. wenger,1.0,One,I purchased this on January 1st 2019 from Amazon. It broke on 6/12/2019. By broke I mean the power just stayed on or it would randomly just turn on by itself. I called Hamilton Beach and got a warranty replacement. Awesome!! Today 12/7/19 It started doing the same thing. It was set to keep warm for 2 hours I happened to walk by 4 hours later and it was still on. I pressed the power button and it would not shut off. I unplugged it and threw it away. This is how houses burn down. One faulty product is a problem TWO in a row is dangerous. DO NOT BUY.
"November 1, 2017",Belinda Joyner,5.0,6,The Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 cup programmable coffeemaker is very nice. I haven't had any issues with the water running down the back of it and if you don't over fill it this shouldn't happen. Also I've read the blue screen that shows the clock ect is very bright and blinding but who's standing there just staring at it. It's nice to be able to have your coffee made and ready when you wake up and it makes a great cup of coffee made mild to bold you choose.
"October 25, 2016",Hd Lemng,4.0,2,"Works and tmakes good coffee.  You have to get used to filling a ""bucket"" with water, instead of a carafe, but it keeps the coffee warmer and is easy to serve.  Two design challenges: 1. you serve the coffee by pressing the rim of your cup against a bar that requires a medium amount of pressure and sometimes the whole machine slides or tips backwards from the pressure. 2. The bar is up under the holding tank enough that the lighting angle in our kitchen does not get light into the serving area, so you can't really see how full the cup is while you are serving. A small light source up under the tank would be a great improvement."
"December 6, 2015",C,2.0,11,"I have been through 2 iterations of this line of coffee maker.  The first one you had to remove the reservoir to fill the unit.  That one basically flooded my kitchen counter with water/coffee after 3 months of use.  It was a refurbished model so I just chalked it up to being defective and went back to using a standard Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. This past year I decided to try this line again.  A coffee maker with a dispenser instead of a carafe and a tank that you fill at the sink and hang back onto the unit … My coffee dream machine!  It was great, no mess, no flooded counters after dumping water into the back of the maker, since, well, you didn’t need to. Brewed well, cleaned well.  NO complaints about the operation of the unit from a user standpoint. Until one day I go to brew a pot of coffee and half of the grounds were soaked through with water and the other half were still bone-dry and the coffee, instead of flowing through into the tank that holds it, ended up gushing from where it’s supposed to be dispensed from. Not worth the money.  I’m sticking with my Mr. Coffee coffee pots."
"February 15, 2016",Aly,5.0,5,"Ok I have been thru SO many coffee machines and broken so many coffee pots so I finally decided to really do some research on a new machine.  I found reviews for this machine on a few websites and decided to take a chance.  Best purchase I've ever made!!!!!  So first of all I'm not sure why people were saying that it spills when your getting your coffee because I've used my huge travel mug and its perfectly fine.  I will say it is sometimes hard to see if your not in a well lit area and then you might fill too full but you just have to try to watch or just use a light color mug.  There was a review I read that said you can't turn the heater on again after its turned off because it will just beep at you to put in water but if you push and hold the power button for about 5-10 second, problem solved and your coffee will heat up again with out any problem.  I've only tried making hot coffee in this though and I always new a full pot on bold setting so I having messed around with it too much.  It's seriously the best machine I've ever had and it makes great tasting coffee."
"May 14, 2021",AJOTX,1.0,,"In years past I’ve had a few of this model coffee maker and always loved it. For the past 6 years I’ve had Keurig. I decided to go back to a regular coffeemaker so I went with what I used to love. The quality must have gone down. This thing feels like a kid’s toy. It was so light and cheap feeling and looking. I used it one time. I made my coffee, went to grab a cup and the coffee had leaked all over the counter and the floor. Really, really horrible quality. I’m really bummed too because this was always my favorite coffee maker."
"June 20, 2021",Bethany,1.0,,"I’ve been buying this brand and model since it came out. I love the ease of the dispenser bar. You just push your cup against the bar and fill up. When I needed to replace the worn out one, I of course ordered the same thing. Well, that one leaked all over from the dispenser bar. Okay, just a faulty one. Amazon sent a replacement quickly. Now the replacement is doing the same thing only 3 months in. I’m guessing some genius in product development decided they should fix what wasn’t broken. Now they’ve lost a very loyal customer."
"November 14, 2018",Laurie,1.0,One,"I definitely do not recommend this product. I had another Hamilton Beach coffee maker (similar style) that worked like a charm for years, but eventually needed to be replaced. After researching other options, I decided to order this one from the same brand thru Amazon. I don't know if the issue is due to Hamilton Beach producing these differently in the past, or Amazon selling inferior products, but I've had this less that 9 months and it leaks all over the counter every time I use it (which unfortunately is every morning). This is not a little leak, this is an 'all over the counter, large puddle of coffee' leak. I've had to put a dishtowel under the coffee pot to absorb it until I can get a new one, which means that every morning I have a coffee soaked towel to wash. I checked the warranty (1 yr), however, the consumer has to pay not only the return shipping, but also the shipping for them to send a replacement. Not happy at all"
"January 27, 2021",Brett L,3.0,,"Like others have stated, the one flaw with this brewer is it starts out great but the dispensing of coffee slows down over time, to the point where it’ll trickle down the front of the machine instead of your cup, bypassing the drip tray in the process to leave a big puddle on the counter. I got sick of this happening, so I grabbed a screwdriver and removed the 2 screws on either side of where the coffee dispenses (under the tank) to see what was going on. After taking out the stopper (watch out for the spring), I could see the problem: the mesh dome that covers the outlet was full of coffee grime (attached a pic). This is after doing a cleaning cycle too. Rather than trying to clean it, I stuck my finger up through the hole and pushed the screen out. Then I reassembled the stopper arm/spring, leaving the screen off. And wouldn’t you know, the coffee pours out of the dispenser now, probably better then when it was new! Even more important, it all goes into my cup, without any dribble down the front. I’m guessing the dome screen is there to prevent fine grounds from making their way into the cup, since they probably settle to the bottom of the tank, but I’ll take a little grit over a huge mess. As a note, I did try soaking the screen in white vinegar for a day, but it remained pretty stained even after that and some serious scrubbing, so I’m leaving it out for good. With this flaw removed, I’m back to enjoying this brewer like when I first got it."
"October 12, 2018",Tonya Penelton,1.0,2,"My coffee resivoir leaks brewed coffee all over. It started when I had it only 3 months. I contacted Hamilton Beach via email.  They said I need CALL them (which if I wanted to call I would have called in the first place) between their business hours of like 9-4 eastern time for which I am working and can't take long to be on hold, but then I need to pay them $5.99 for shipping and handling fees to get a new resivoir. Now I know it's only $6. And my pot will be like new for a month or so until the new one leaks. But I feel I shouldn't have to pay 1dime even. I paid for the coffee pot brand new and when I bought it I wouldn't have thought I would have to pay an additional $6 shipping when I got free shipping to begin with! So I'm irritated with this situation all together. And haven't called to pay them to get a replacement. I may go with another brand at this time."
"March 20, 2017",Steve P,4.0,2,"After a few weeks of using this coffee maker on a daily basis, I have a few observations: 1.) The display (clock/timer) is EXTREMELY bright. My entire kitchen has a blue hue to it when the rest of the lights are out. I'm genuinely surprised at how intense the light is coming off of it. If you need a nightlight in your kitchen, just plug this thing in and you're good to go. Unfortunately, there is no dimming function or ability to turn the display light off. 2.) The coffee itself - since I haven't altered the brand or water-to-coffee ratio of my old ""normal"" (i.e., standard drip) coffee maker - tastes a bit stronger (I've always brew on the ""Strong"" settings anyway) than previous... I think this might have to do with the filter/ground-coffee apparatus being submerged/semi-submerged in the reservoir. Your mileage may vary on this, depending on your coffee and flavor preference. 3.) After brewing, the coffee dispensed isn't as hot as my old 'glass carafe sitting on a hot-plate' maker. There is a small warming plate below the reservoir that transfers heat to another metal plate inside the reservoir itself, and while you can hear the element is heating the coffee, it's definitely not 'piping hot,' which may or may not be a good thing, depending on your sensitivity. Personally, I'd prefer if it were a little warmer, but it's a quick 30 seconds in the microwave if needed... no big deal. Also, the metal plate in the reservoir tends to get a little tough to clean, as any grounds that may have slipped through the filter (I brew Bustelo, which is VERY finely ground) tend to stick/burn to the plate... It's really not that big a deal if you clean the reservoir daily, but worth noting IMO. I also like that you have an option to alter the ""keep warm"" time for between 0-4 hours. I have not brewed iced coffee yet (it's still very cold here), nor do I know if I will, but I wonder how the heating elements will affect the process, considering you're told to put ice cubes in the reservoir. One final note, while eliminating the carafe does reduce the width of the device, it makes the device a bit deeper, but it's not really much bigger than a typical coffee maker. All-in-all, I'm satisfied with the purchase."
"January 31, 2021",Michael Fridy,1.0,,I'VE HAD THIS FOR THREE MONTHS NOW. AS IT DISPENSES COFFEE DRIBBLES DOWN FACE AND YOU END UP WITH COFFEE UNDER THE MAKER. I'M TIRED OF FIDDLING AROUND WITH IT.I HAD THE SAME BRAND BEFORE BUT A DIFFERENT DESIGN...THIS ONE IS HEADED FOR THE TRASH AND I WON'T BE BUYING THIS BRAND AGAIN. YOU'D THINK THEY TEST THESE OUT BEFORE THEY SELL THEM...NO PROTOTYPE OR Q/A OBVIOUSLY.IT DOES HEAT AND MAKE COFFEE....THEY GET 1 STAR FOR OVERALL BECAUSE THE CONCEPT OF NO CARAFE IS NOT A TRADE OFF FOR THE MESS.The other Hamilton design is not good either.
"July 9, 2017",Richmond Kid,5.0,7,"Improvement over previous model that required pouring water into integral tank. Filling removable tank makes it much easier to eliminate fill spilling. Also improved is the dispensing ""stream"" that had a tendency to cause problems at low flow. I haven't had the problems others apparently had from vaporized liquid draining from the top of the tank cover. I usually empty the tank within 2 hours and then rinse the tank and wipe the inside of the lid - no problems with liquid pooling on counter. The only ""problem"" is  fewer cups than the water holder indicates. Solution is pour 1 more cup than you expect."
"February 23, 2020",Sean,2.0,,"I do not like that you can't have it stay warm past 4 hours. And you can't just power it back on to stay warm, you have to put water in the reservoir for it to turn on. It is nice, however, that it has the delayed start time and auto shut off. When you put your cup up to the button you have to hold it or make sure its completely against the wall, or it moves. It also gets coffe everywhere when you dispense it, as it drips all down the outside of your cup. When it brews, it gets coffee grounds all over the underneath side of the lid creating an even bigger mess to clean up after you clean up the coffee that has dripped everywhere. I love the reservoir concept, and it makes it really nice to just hold your cup there and top off your coffee. The version I had about 10 years ago was perfect, this newer version needs some work."
"November 14, 2015",Jenna,5.0,2,"I just got this today and used it. I have used coffee pots like this in the past and prefer them over the glass carafes that break easily. It is easy to set up, instructions are really not needed so I didn't bother to look for them. To set the time, hit the program button, and then adjust the hour (left) and minutes (right) buttons. To set up your automatic brew (which is one of the main reasons I got this), hold the program button down and with your other hand, adjust the time you want it to start. Easy! It does not come with a water filter. I didn't even look for that feature but there is one available for purchase separately. I will be ordering one of those next. For now, I use bottled water to reduce the gunk in my coffee and in the pot. No fancy cleaners needed - the booklet actually suggests using vinegar to do so. The drip pan at the bottom is removable if you have a taller mug that will not fit, but it only offers maybe an additional 1/4 inch. However, I will say that my travel mug is 8 inches tall and 2 1/2 in wide (It's tall and narrow) and it fits in there without removing it. It doesn't leave much room to visualize when you need to stop releasing the coffee into it, but if I removed the tray, I would be able to see better. I don't do more than just over the 2 cup mark anyway since I only fill said mug once a day. I don't really have to worry about overflow. It also offers a feature that I was not expecting....It makes iced coffee! All summer long I was looking for an inexpensive way to make it...now I can. I have not done a test run yet to see how well it works. Every other method was either too time consuming or ended up really watered down. ,"
"September 19, 2019",J. Gilford,5.0,,"I waited a month to give a review. Easy to operate. Programming is easy. Easy cleaning. I clean with a bottle sponge. So far no dripping. Will fill a travel cup with no problem. We added a reusable basket from our previous coffee maker. Works just fine for 6 cups. If I were to make more I would use a paper filter. You can set a warmer timer on this up to 4 hours. It’s not boiling hot, but very warm. This I love. I don’t care for hot coffee so my husband gets his hot and I get mine warm. We get up at different times. I added a pic so you can it broken down. They have a great video on how to use it."
"March 11, 2021",isappb,1.0,,"We purchased this coffeepot on 1-6-2021, today is 3-11-2021. We thought this it was ok for a while. What we did not realize was that it was leaking coffee underneath. This is a picture of what this piece of junk has done to  my beautiful butcher block counter top! I am NOT happy.  It is AWFUL! I have scrubbed and scrubbed and this is as good as it got. My counter has be be sanded until this goes away and then resealed. Who do you think gets to pay for that?  I am trying to contact Hamilton Beach to see what they will do about my counter, probably nothing. DO NOT waste your hard earned money on this model!!"
"June 3, 2020",cssdwilson,4.0,,"I was so excited when my husband bought me this new coffee maker. No pot and less cleaning. That's funny!! The back of the maker leaks bad, coffee goes everywhere. On the back of the maker, in the bottom of the maker and all over my cup. It makes me want to go back to my original coffee pot. So disappointed!!! Update: the company sent me a new top part of the pot that holds the water but it still leaks pretty bad down the front and now one of the holes on the bottom of the pot, the part that holds the water leaks. The water it holds to go into the bottom and really bad when it's holding coffee. I wanted a cool coffee pot that I didn't have to clean more than drinking my coffee."
"September 25, 2018",Willaim J. DiNuovo,1.0,One,"I don't think I have ever disliked a coffee machine as much as this one and I so wanted to love it as the idea of no carafe is very appealing.  However, I have owned many forms of coffee makers from stovetop and electric percolators to French presses to the Keurigs, and on to the grind and brews, Mr. Coffees, espresso/cappuchino makers and almost everything else in between, but this is by far the worse of the bunch.  There is a design flaw that allows a tremendous amount of condensation to collect underneath the lid and under the basket holding the coffee and filter thereby allowing water to constantly drip into your just brewed coffee.  Also, bulky and awkward to clean and, of course, as already noted, too high to open without hitting cabinets.  Go elsewhere to find your dream machine, this isn't it!"
"July 5, 2021",Stormy,1.0,,I dont generally leave reviews but this coffee maker is so bad it deserves one. I got my first one in April this year and no more than a month later it starts leaking about a cup of water from the dispencer . I contacted them and they were very nice and sent me another one. About a month later it would only make half a pot of coffee. After taking off the coffee pot to clean I discovered that there was water pooled around the heating element. So I cleaned the coffee maker with vinager to see if that would help Nope only made it worse.
"April 24, 2020",Mary Willis,1.0,,Bought 12/23/2019.. last week it started leaking.... This week.. it won't brew coffee....  I called the company and closed because of COVID 19...  left message...  NOTE:  as a rule ... I LOVE this coffee maker ... it is my Third one.... and over time... I have had the leak problem before... BUT NOT AFTER A FEW MONTHS... I hope someone calls to make this right!  I was even telling people on FB a couple weeks ago... how much I love this coffee pot because there is no carafe to break....  And SMACK... now no coffee maker...
"April 18, 2016",kcvinweho,5.0,2,"I bought this to replace an older model Hamilton Beach coffee maker (also without carafe).  This is a big improvement.  It's much easier to get the water into the machine, whereas the older model had an awkward setup.  It brews quickly and well, holds coffee hot for up to 4 hours (I usually choose 1-2 and it's still hot at the end of that time frame), and is easy to clean.  Works with any kind of cup, doesn't drip.  Has programming features the older model didn't, such as delay brew, warming time, brew strength and # of cups brewed. To make a perfect cup, subtract one scoop from what you would normally use.  For example, if you are brewing 6 cups of coffee, use 5 scoops of ground coffee.  You'll get a nice strong cup, but not bitter."
"October 21, 2020",Frankie,4.0,One,"This was my third Hamilton beach brew station I have purchased.  My only complaint is after a few years, the bottom of the station leaked coffee on the counter.  We used it ALOT.  But it didn’t keep us from buying one for my mom and another for ourselves.  Perfect for an elderly person to not need to handle a glass pot that she could break and be hurt."
"December 6, 2017",J. Pratt,2.0,One,"I really wanted this to be a great solution for my mom and grandmother. I thought the seperate water tank and dispenser system would make it easier for them to use. I also liked that it kept the coffee hot while not burning it. I went home for a visit and used it for a month and I liked it as well. Then, about six months after purchase it would spill coffee all over the back part of the dispenser after it was down to half a ‘pot’. My mother cleaned it, ran vinegar through it, tried multiple different things to no avail. In the end, I bought a traditional, basic coffee pot as a replacement this week and this one is going in the trash."
"September 1, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Love the concept.  This is actually my 2nd HB self serving coffee maker.  I like that this model has the detachable water reservoir; but I have to place my hand on top of the maker so when I press the dispenser (need to use more pressure than my last) the coffee maker won't slide on counter.  I can deal with that but what really has me bummed out is the heating element.  I read all the reviews before purchasing; several commented on this and others have no problem so I thought it was worth a try.  My 1st time using, coffee was EXCELLENT.  The next day, I had to place it in the microwave to have it hot enough (I have to do that about 55% of the time).  I know when I'm going to luck out with a hot cup; because I can actually hear the coffee ""percolating""  Not a fan of the noise, but rather have that and hot coffee.  I've ""learned"" that if I somewhat press down on the collection unit to insure contact with the warming element; it seems to do the trick most of the time."
"October 13, 2017",wilfred garris,1.0,One,"I have purchased Hamilton Beach coffee makers in the past and wanted to replace my current one with this. I like to wait to use a product before I review it and have waited a month. I use the maker each weekend the family drinks about 2 pots a day (saturday and sunday) I have only been able to make 3 pots with this machine. I keep getting the message ""pour water"" with a beeping. I have emptied the machine and refilled it but still the same. I have tried to contact the seller but no response. I have gone old school and gotten a stove top percolator. When you need coffee you NEED coffee not a device that talks back."
"March 4, 2016",Mandie,5.0,2,"I bought this to replace my tired Keurig and am SO glad I did! I know a lot of people say that this drips water and that it's tough to keep clean (heating element on the inside of the holding tank), but I'm not having any issues with mine and I'll tell you why. If you open the lid slowly, the condensation from brewing doesn't drip all over the counter. It seems like the lid is made to where if you open it slowly, it'll catch the drips in the tank, where they're meant to be. Regarding the cleaning, I use vinegar after every use to clean the heating element off. The element does tend to get stained if I go longer than 2 cycles without cleaning, but for now, I've managed to keep it completely clean with regular vinegar cleanings even though I've been using this unit literally every day. I couldn't be happier with this coffee machine for the price. It brews a great cup, I haven't had any issues with it yet, and the auto brew settings, which I almost forgot to bring up, are STELLAR! I clean this bad boy every night before I go to bed, set it all back up, and set it to brew at 0630 the next morning. It brews 10-12 cups in less than 5-10 minutes, and I'm a happy camper. Seriously. If you're looking for a good coffee maker-- FOR THE PRICE-- buy this one. You won't regret it!!!! No carafe to break, and this thing is idiot proof! LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER! No more Keurig for me!"
"April 4, 2019",CampingIsFun,1.0,One,"After 6 months the coffee maker has started leaking. I followed the directions on FAQs to help with this, but no improvement. I called into Hamilton Beach's warranty line, and after being on hold for an hour I left a message asking for a callback. Several days later and they have not called. I can understand a faulty product, it happens to the best of companies. But the management of their warranty line indicates to me that they are not serious about resolving the problem."
"March 4, 2020",Harley F.,4.0,,"I love this coffee maker! It would have received a 5 star review if it kept coffee just a little warmer. I'm someone who take 4-5 hours to drink a pot, by my 3rd cup it's not very warm. The strength is great, it is so easy to use and clean. I love not having a caraft that drips all over my counters. We originally bought this bc we were building our coffee bar and because our older one dripped everywhere. I'm not disappointed by our purchase. I have recommended this product to 5 friends and everyone of them has since purchased it or is planning to purchase it in the near future."
"June 16, 2021",Phil,5.0,,"This version of the Hamilton Beach Coffeemaker is the better more troublefree design.  DO NOT BUY the version with the water reservoir on the side.  It gave us nothing but trouble, and would not brew the whole reservoir of water.  We had to keep turning it on to have it finish brewing.  We had to return that version twice and then bout this version with the water well built in, and has been perfect and trouble free.  A much more simple design and can be cleaned easily.  Markings for water and coffee that has been brewed are large and easy to read."
"April 25, 2021",Lil Debbie224,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker, the only reason I ordered another one is, I was cleaning my old one and I somehow popped off the part that holds the little spring, we couldn't fix it, although my old one did leak, we thought we were doing something wrong. My new one hasn't leaked at all. I love the settings on it, we use it on bold, comes out very good. I can't wait to use the cold brew setting. So, after reading reviews, if it doesn't work perfect, I'd send for a new one, because they are great coffee makers."
"October 27, 2017",Sadie,5.0,One,"I originally bought this in October 2016, I didn’t use it much probably 2-3x a week. But I loved it. The convenience of it keeping the coffee hot and just putting my cup up to the spout and pressing can’t be beat. I moved in June 2017 and this managed to get left behind, I loved it so much I bought a second! I’m not a big fan of pod coffee, and with this I can make a full pot if both my husband and I are drinking coffee or just a few cups if it’s just me. The flexibility is astounding. The one thing I will note is make sure you clean it with vinegar if you have hard water!"
"December 21, 2020",C. Farley,2.0,,A year and I can't get this thing to quit leaking all over the counter.  You might expect to see some coffee under the dispenser but if you lift up the coffee pot you will find a lot more coffee under it.  I've tried to see a spot it is leaking from and it has to be the main body of the pot but I can't find where.  You can put the same amount of water in it every time and get a different amount of cups out of it consistently.  I have always supported Hamilton Beach appliances and with this coffee pot I must decide to try a new manufacturer.  I am so disappointed.
"April 12, 2021",TimH,4.0,,"Our old coffee maker, couldn't keep the heat very long and got tired of reheating each cup in the Microwave.  Purchased this one mostly due it 4 hour heat retention.  Overall very satisfied with it.  One issue, due to the way it dispenses each cup, there is certain amount of coffee dripping down the back side and under the unit.  Requires a cleanup after every batch.  Small issue given the other features we like so it works for us.  Also brew time is fairly quick and the coffee is decent."
"October 1, 2017",Jeremy,4.0,One,"While it is made of plastic, which isn't always the top quality, this thing doesn't perform any worse as a result. My only gripes are as such: - The LED screen should have been a dark background with lit numbers, as it's difficult to read without being 8 inches away. - Condensation will remain in the top lid indefinitely, unless you hand dry it yourself. - The filter holder is a pain to wash and dry! - It would have been great for the tank's handle to be accessible without having to remove the filter apparatus. - The plug cord's length could be a bit more generous. I know that seems like a long list, but none of them truly impeded the function of this coffeemakers. I love not having an actual pot, I love the automatic brew with a ""keep warm"" setting, and I love the easily viewable water/coffee levels."
"December 31, 2018",Pappa,3.0,,"I bought this coffee maker in July of 2016 and have used it once daily since then. Initially, it was a good coffee maker and i was excited to have one that stays warm without a bottom burner and i liked the novelty of pouring by a push button. One thing I didn't like though, was if you had a coffee mug with a dark color inside of the cup, it was hard to see when the coffee was at the top of the  mug. You have to get your head down close to the mug to see. Over the last few months it has started to only dribble from the spigot. The issue is a little metal screen that the coffee is filtered through. It has coffee buildup on it and I cannot get it clean no matter what I try. You can't get it out to clean it, and you can't replace it. As a result, i will have to throw this coffee maker away and get a new one. For the price, i would have expected this to last longer than 2.5 years.  I will not buy this one again."
"August 11, 2019",Val N. Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Just what I wanted! Carafe free so no worries on breaking a carafe. Simple to use and clean. Brews a great cup of coffee and you can set a timer to keep your coffee warm up to 4hrs. without it scorching it and ruining the flavor. Very easy to clean and setup to make coffee. Water fill container is separate for filling. Takes normal coffee filters for 12 cup makers. You can program the coffee maker to automatically brew coffee as well. I have not tried this feature yet, but suspect it is very easy to do. Price great too! Durable, very pleased with it."
"February 18, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"This coffee maker replaced one, of the same type, that we had for many, many, many years. Our old one had begun leaking from the reservoir and the coffee just wasn’t staying warm.  We were very happy they still made this coffee maker since the old one had lasted us well over 10 years. We received the new coffee maker and used it the next morning. Coffee is definitely HOT although the burner sounds like a small airplane (says the husband) or a kind of loud heating element (says the wife) the entire time it is on. And ..... it leaks. The reservoir, if not TIGHTLY  seated, will leak water all over the counter. So, as long as the reservoir is super securely seated it is great. If it’s not, than you’ll be wiping off your counter instead of having a nice HOT cup of joe!"
"June 16, 2020",Kteague92,5.0,,"Love setting a time for the brew and waking up to the smell of fresh coffee. The bold brew setting does make a difference. The hot plate can keep coffee hot for up to 4 hours, like it was just brewed which is nice. There is an option to brew iced coffee, i just never tried it. The dispenser is an easy press to dispense kind of gig. You just press your cup or mug of any size up to it and voila, coffee. Easy to clean as  which is crucial for coffee makers. No filters needed if you but a reusable filter from amazon or the store. Makes clean up and use a breeze!"
"February 13, 2020",Ash Grosz,2.0,,"My husband loved this coffee maker for some odd reason. He likes to stick to something, even if it doesn't work well. He's been buying these every few years since we've been together for 9 years. So we're on the 4th one that I'm aware of. They're hard to clean, leave a burnt coffee smell and the button you press for coffee starts leaking all over your counter. You have to angle the spout in a very specific way to where it won't get water ALL over your counter. It sits too low if you have a large travel coffee mug so you can't ever get a full container. I hate you, and I'm proud to say I've finally convinced him to buy a different brand. <3"
"September 4, 2019",Kris B,1.0,,"The concept of having the brew ready to dispense without a carafe was appealing but a few things/poor design that I immediately found, and returning it for something else.  1) the ""only"" way to dispense coffee is to press your mug against the grey button which is unfortunately about 2"" higher than the top of a standard ceramic mug,  2) you have to hold the top of the coffee maker while pushing against the dispense button otherwise the coffee maker slides around or you have to butt the maker against a wall,  3)  It is very slow to dispense a full 10oz cup of coffee - I can do 2 Keurig Kcups in the time this fills one 10-12oz coffee cup and you have to hold your cup the entire time, and 4) the filling area is very narrow which means most mugs won't fit in well."
"May 27, 2020",HannahG,2.0,,This is our second Brewstation. The first one we had was an older model which worked almost perfectly for about 7 years. The dispenser finally stopped working so we decided to “upgrade” to the newer model with the water tank. When it arrived I washed it and set it up to run the next morning. When I got up to have my first cup I noticed the sound it was making. It sounded like it was still brewing even though it had been ready for at least an hour. We never noticed this sound on our previous brewstaion. It kind of concerned me because I didn’t know if it would end up burning the coffee. I contacted the company and they told me the sound was normal. Other than that it worked fine and dispensed perfectly. A few days later I brewed the coffee like normal. It shut off after 4 hours. Then when I went to get it set up for the next morning I noticed some coffee on the counter and under the machine. I thought maybe I had spilled some on accident but then when I lifted up the coffee tank I noticed some brewed coffee inside the area next to the heat plate which is not supposed to happen. I ave already contacted Hamilton Beach and I’m hoping they can resolve the issue.
"November 14, 2020",DYI dude,1.0,,The coffee maker is perfect if you want good cup of coffee. The trouble with this machine - IT LEAKS - from above the dispenser push button as you fill your cup.  This is the second machine I received after returning the first one for the same reason. It got a one star rating because there isn't a zero star rating. My previous Hamilton Beach (the same model) worked fine for years before I needed to replace it. I believed the new machine would function the same as the old one. WRONG !! I discovered the difference between the two was my original was USA made. The new one was made in Mexico. I plan on returning this machine as well.
"September 4, 2019",Tazgyrl78,5.0,,This is what I have had in mind forever as I drink coffee all day and I wanted something that kept coffee hot longer and since I have weak wrists just fill water once instead of fill and transfer.  The only thing I dislike is that I cant tell how much coffee is made as that window is on the side facing away from me toward the microwave so I get upset when I am getting coffee and it doesnt fill the Contiga cup and have to wait for the next cycle to brew but other than that I love this
"July 15, 2021",E. D. Glover,2.0,,"The coffee station started leaking 2 days past my return window. Varying on how much coffee is left in the station once the warner timer expires will determine how much of a mess needs to be cleaned up the next morning. I read the other reviews about the machine leaking, but sort of figured Hamilton Beach would have remedied it after 2-3 years of complaints? I was wrong. I was wanting a coffee station similar to this where you don't have a pot and prior to ordering this one had a Mr Coffee that lasted 22 years before it finally died. I shopped for another Mr Coffee station, but I guess they worked too good and wasn't in production no longer. Anyway, I have since just ordered a Mr Coffee with pot and will see how it works out. I do know I'll never buy a Hamilton Beach product again!"
"June 27, 2017",Brenda J. Smith,5.0,One,We have been using this for a week now and it works wonderful. Coffee is HOT when served I can fill my cup and take my 20 minute drive to work and the coffee is still very warm. I read some reviews that said the coffee tasted like plastic or burnt we have not noticed that. The only down side was my reusable filter doesn't fit perfectly so we have opted to use paper filters. Another perk (no pun intended) is that we have not had the pot overrun because someone set the coffeemaker up and forgot to empty the pot. It is very quiet my old coffeemaker sputtered as it was finishing brewing this doesn't make that sound. Still reaching for the pot that isn't there but not as often.:o)
"May 12, 2020",Debbie,1.0,,"We had a Hamilton Beach coffeemaker of this same style for MANY years and loved it! Then it got to where the coffee would not stop pouring out even when we removed our cup. We cleaned out grounds below the rubber seal often which usually helped. Finally, we could not get it to stop spilling out coffee.  Our new one leaked all over our granite countertop and down our newly painted wall after only a couple weeks.  I immediately removed it. I'm sad to say I missed the return window.  Our whole family loves the way this coffeemaker operates, but now we do not trust it not to leak all over the place and cause damage."
"September 6, 2016",yardmanjd,3.0,,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS This coffee maker was easy and intuitive to use and set up. The removable water tank simplifies the filling process, and I like the back-lit display which can be seen in the dark. After cleaning, I ran a full tank of water (filled a little beyond the 12-cup line) through the unit and measured the amount I got out in a kitchen measuring cup. The result: 64 fluid ounces or 2 quarts. Thus, 1 Brew Station cup actually equates to 5.33 ounces. I expect I will get a little less when actually brewing coffee as the grounds will absorb some water. The one thing I don't like is that the coffee maker has no power outage ride-through capability.  It loses its ""brains"" during short power outages and has to be reset.  As I actually use this coffee maker, I may update this review. COMMENTS AFTER USE FOR AWHILE All-in-all, I am generally satisfied with this coffee maker.  The only complaint I have is that it does not keep coffee hot to the very last mug full of coffee.  Due to the large bottom area of the coffee reservoir and the relatively small area of the metal heating plate in the bottom of the reservoir, when the coffee level in the reservoir gets low, very little of the remaining coffee is in contact with the heating plate.  Thus, once the coffee volume in the reservoir gets low, the remaining coffee does not stay hot.  I always have to run the last mug of coffee through the microwave to heat it up to the desired temperature.  The design could be improved to remedy this problem, but I would buy this coffee maker again. FINAL COMMENTS This coffee maker lasted less than 4 years.  The main issue was with the dispensing button that one presses the coffee cup against to dispense coffee.  The plastic warped or distorted such that I had to hold the back of the coffee maker and press the cup very hard against the button to even get a dribble of coffee.  The other thing that I did not like about this coffee maker was that I could not tell when the coffee reservoir was empty so I didn't end up with burned coffee sludge in it.  I went back to a Cuisinart with a removable glass carafe."
"November 7, 2016",tnbiker,3.0,2,"Meh. It is easy to pour water into and clean than their other makers, however, it slides backwards with any pressure on the bar to dispense liquid, just some simple rubber grips would have solved this problem. It is also VERY loud when brewing and does not chime when ready to serve. For this price, a good maker, but I am still deciding if it is worth keeping or not. Also, their ""cup"" measurements are WAY off for USA. If you choose 4 cups, you will do good to get two cups filled. Double your estimation so as not to have to brew a new pot if you drink much coffee at all. It does taste good after you have put about 10 brews through it. Initially, even with washing, it tasted nasty. Again, for the price it is a good maker, and you can get some travel mugs under it, but if you have hydrofasks that are over 12 oz you will be disappointed and have to fill it via a smaller cup. First world problems, right?"
"March 14, 2016",Ali McD,1.0,4,"The worst coffee maker I have ever owned... And they won't accept a return. Many issues; - Doesn't keep your coffee warm - Lots of residue in the warming area - Coffee burns on the internal warming plate, unhealthy and ruins the taste of every batch - Coffee is only hot for a few minutes after brewing - Have to pull the whole machine apart to make a cup of coffee - Grinds in the holding area - Have to tilt the machine to get the last cup out, which causes water to go everywhere - Water pools under the machine Hate adding this to a landfill, but no other option... Won't buy an appliance on Amazin again."
"February 21, 2020",Laurie Oliveira,1.0,One,I have to push the coffee maker up against the back splash in order to dispense coffee otherwise it slips and spills hot coffee on our hands. I do fiind that the coffee maker is noisy after brewing and there is no signal to let you know when brewing is done or when it shuts off after set warming time is done. No light to see when coffee mug is full. Hard tell how much coffee is in the reservior due to the condensation that accumulates inside the guage reader. Coffee tastes great. Very easy to clean. Changed my rating to one star. Coffe maker leaks from the reservoir all over the counter. I have cleaned the dispenser . I never add coffee ground while  the basket is in  place.
"February 10, 2021",Nicole Woodward,1.0,,"This BrewStation, actually all variations with different model numbers, are junk. We love the idea and the 4 hr warming plate has been the only reason it’s lasted in our home. This is the 4/5th one we’ve tried, I know, shame on us. Hamilton Beach has sent a replacement twice. Each replacement has the same defect. When the button is depressed to fill your mug, there is a trickle that goes down the button and onto the counter. We’ve accepted it as a downside of owning these machines. No more! This most recent purchase leaked right out of the box and continues to get worse. HB just sent a replacement and somehow it leaks worse than the first. All machines are being returned and we will never buy this product again."
"July 6, 2020",Daisy,5.0,,"Got one of these from the thrift store and loved it, so when I moved back to the mainland from Hawaii, this was on my list of things to get for the house ☺️ Neat trick: if the button you push with your cup quits working (the one I got from the thrift store had this issue) you can drill a little hole through the little lever that the bottom moves and put some string though it. Then to dispense, all you do is put your cup in place and pull the string ☺️ I love this little coffee maker and will buy it over and over again ☺️"
"December 13, 2020",Sky,1.0,One,"Great hot and iced coffee and I absolutely LOVE the convenience. Awful longevity. Bought in March 2020, and just had to replace it because it started leaking everywhere. If I had to guess either the heat from the hot plate is making the plastic around it expand, or the heat from the hot plate is ruining the screw gaskets. Either way, a coffee pot should last years, not months."
"February 12, 2021",J. T.,1.0,,"We had this units previous model for numerous years, and it worked like a champ.  It was great, which is why when it finally met its end, we had no 2nd thoughts about ordering this newer model of the same unit.  Well, the experience with the newer model did not go well at all.  We received the new unit, and quickly set it up and used it, only to have coffee leak all over the counter when you dispensed coffee into your coffee cup.  It was leaking from somewhere behind the backstop to where you place your coffee cup to fill it.  We wrote it off as we just received a ""bad unit"", so we contacted Amazon and they quickly sent out a replacement unit.  Well, the replacement unit did the exact same thing.  This 2nd unit leaked coffee all over the counter as you fill your coffee cup, just like the 1st unit had. At this point, we abandoned this design, because something had obviously changed from the earlier generation of this coffee maker.  We were pretty disappointed, because we really loved the ease and design of the earlier generation, and were excited to get this newer model.  We returned the 2nd unit, and went with a more standard design coffee maker, which of course worked as it should."
"January 31, 2019",Chet M. Adriano,2.0,One,"Bought this coffee maker Dec 27 2016. This coffee maker worked great for the first year & half. after that, it started slowing down dispensing the coffee. I cleaned it every month with vinegar to keep the system flowing smoothly. But it just steadily slowed down in dispensing coffee & it would leak water from the base. There's a small filter at the bottom of the coffee maker that can't be removed or replaced & that causes the coffee to dispense very slowly. After the Christmas Holidays, It was so annoying how slow the coffee comes out & you'd have to tip the coffee maker to even get it to pour coffee. Disappointing that it only lasted 2 years."
"May 20, 2021",Sam from Alabam,5.0,,"I have been using this product for years and this is my third purchase.  The first two stood up under use in an office setting of 25 people, now I'm retired and this one is mine.  There is no pot to wash or break.  Coffee dispenses like a soda at McDonald's, just push a bar with your cup.  Easy to keep clean and coffee tastes great.  I highly recommend this coffee pot.  Besides its hilarious watching folks trying to figure out how to get the coffee when there's NO POT!!!"
"July 31, 2019",Porterville Dave Debra,1.0,,"For as long as I can remember I get up at 5:00 a.m. I've always set up coffee makers to auto-start so my coffee is ready after I dress for the day. Every coffee maker that I've owned had a light so that you could see what you're doing while pouring a cup of coffee. This coffee maker does not have a light. I have to turn on the kitchen lights to see when it's time to stop pouring. This makes me fearful that will wake my wife up. I just can't engage with any human before 8:00 a.m.  This coffee maker is the second Hamilton Beach that I've owned. This one pretty much reeks of flimsy plastic construction. I'll be surprised if it makes it past the 1-year warranty. February 12, 2020 update. I threw the thing in the trash."
"May 7, 2021",K Stevens,1.0,,"This is my second Hamilton Beach (48464) Coffee Maker with 12 Cup Capacity & Internal Storage. The first one lasted a few years with everyday use. This new one just started leaking a week ago (just past Prime free return).  We’ve tried everything, checked the screws and are using less water than indicated.  I have it on a tray to capture the leaked coffee which I clean up after each use. It’s not user error but a product defect. We like this system of dispensing coffee but don’t like the hassle of cleaning up coffee leakage."
"November 11, 2014",Moonstar,3.0,3,"The coffee made by the Hamilton Beach is delicious, and I have had 4 Brewstations.  The coffee maker constantly runs at my house.  However, a flaw with this type of Brewstation with the removable coffee tank is that there is an area that is indented where the tank sits.  During regular use, the water condenses on the lid and trickles down under the coffee tank.  When that fills up, it leaks from the dispenser valve.  It is not coffee, but water than comes out.  It leaks onto your countertop, and can be a considerable amount of water that collects under and around your coffee maker.  The only way to stop it is to dry it after every use, or be one of those people who only brews one pot a day.  I am really sad, because I love the coffee this brewer makes.  It never burns, you can adjust the brew strength, and you can set it to keep warm for up to 4 hours.  I called Hamilton Beach and they are going to replace it for me, but it will still be the same problem, only with a new warranty.  I really hope they fix this, maybe by creating a small drain that goes into a trap that can be easily emptied.  As it is now, you can take all the pieces off and then dump the water out by turning the machine upside down, or you can use paper towels to sop up the mess each time you brew a pot."
"July 23, 2020",Cassandra R. Kemp,1.0,,"I purchased this Hamilton Beach brew master on June 21, 2022.  On July 23, 2020, it just stopped working.  Unfortunately, the window for return ended on July 22, 2020.  This is the third time I have purchased this exact product and nothing like this has happened before.  My previous brew masters worked perfectly.  I will be contacting HB directly because I feel I received a defective unit.  If HB does not stand behind their product, I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  I’m upset that I no longer have a coffee brew station."
"July 24, 2020",christy,4.0,,"We bought this to replace one that broke down. It was maybe five years old and suddenly coffee was somehow being recycled through the brewing cycle. We love the self dispenser though, so we ordered a new one. Disappointment!! The new one leaked badly behind the dispensing bar! Easily reordered and returned at Kohls department store. The new new one arrived two days later. This one operates well, but the silver grill over the drip tray was missing! Not a huge deal, but I had to make a complaint and it took a couple of weeks for the part to arrive."
"August 4, 2018",SRA Mouhammed Awadallah,4.0,One,"works great, a little leaking happens after awhile but I googled it and a forum said to just clean out the mesh drip area so I spray it hot water every week, no problems since, the taste is different from a traditional glass pot, its not disgusting, just had to tweak my usual scoops to water ratio.  overall great product I enjoy not having the glass pot especially with the kids around"
"May 26, 2020",Michael Moulin,2.0,,"I have this a 2 because this pot leaks. I have owned it before and loved it but the last one broke. This one has been used twice now and both times it leaks at the spot where you press to get the coffee out and makes a big mess. Very disappointed! Edit: I added a picture, I had already cleaned up the mess but the leak lines are still visible (from one use, the second time was worse). I feel like the older Hamilton Beach products are far superior to the newer ones. My opinion is that quality control, along with the quality of parts has gone down. I still have my older Hamilton Beach products that are great. I won’t part with my older stuff. It makes me sad to see their quality go down hill. Two broken/defective products leaves me to question getting another. This was just my experience..."
"May 26, 2021",Sally,2.0,,"This coffee maker works all right and the coffee has great flavor and I love that it can make 12 cups but it’s a little clumsy and not easy to clean and is not as easy to use as I thought it would be. Also I have found that it leaks somewhat since every time I use it there’s always a puddle of coffee under the machine  and I don’t think I’m going to keep it I will be looking for a new one I really wanted to like this, But it is not practical for my household."
"January 31, 2015",Wendy,1.0,19,"This is the third time I have purchased this machine over many years. I loved this pot-made great coffee-no glass carafe. I didn't hesitate to replace it when mine stopped working. As soon as I received it I saw that it did not fit together properly. I tried it anyway and although it did brew, the coffee was weak and the machine ""hissed"" the entire time. Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement did the same thing. Contacted Amazon about this flaw and they told me to contact Hamilton Beach and they would take it off the website. Hamilton Beach sent me a lovely e-mail telling me how great their company was, and it's still on Amazon! Don't waste your time & money,,, BUY A DIFFERENT POT!!"
"November 16, 2015",micah gallagher,2.0,2,"First off I purchased this coffee maker because the original BrewStation from Hamilton Beach that I owned before had failed again for the second time. The original one had a plunger that holds a rubber gasket that failed and leaked coffee all over the place twice. Hamilton Beach failed to help me out the second time around and said I could purchase a new container for $26.00 plus shipping. So I opted to buy this new style for $37.00. After receiving this new one I discovered they still use the same plunger and will probably fail again. Now for the actual review. The unit looks nice, but it is very cheap feeling. It weighs nothing and has small suction cups on the back to keep the unit from sliding back wards. But don't slide the coffee maker around because the feet pop out all the time. So if you are like me and pull it out from the wall to fill it and put it back when you are down, pick it up and place it there because you'll get tired of putting he feet back on. The unit takes forever to brew coffee compared to the old unit probably because the heating element is half the size. As others have stated it is very noisey when brewing and even after it is brewing. It makes noise all the time. It has some nice features like the keep warm timer and the pouring into the bottom opposed to the back, but that's about it. Would I buy it again, NO. Would I recommend it, NO."
"September 19, 2019",Amazon Customer,2.0,,We purchased this because we liked the idea of not having a traditional coffee pot. We really did like it at first until we noticed that it continually drips causing coffee to leak all over our counters. The customer support is a joke. I have tried several times to get a hold of them being on for 45 minutes or longer each time. I also left messages for as prompted for a return call to no avail. We would not mind a replacement for our current one because as I stated we did really like it before it started continuously dripping. We have done the proper maintenance as suggested in the book.
"January 14, 2021",Margaret Yeargan,2.0,,"Makes great coffee, keeps it hot and flavorful. Love the dispenser, but it leaks all over the place. When dispensing coffee it leaks from top down front of pot, and when brewing it leaks from the bottom all over the counter top. Very awkward to fill with water due to center and angle water has to be poured in. Also the inside dispenser that is used to fill pot also leaks and dribbles water everywhere. Had one of these pots about 10 years ago and it was great. Very disappointed in this one. will start looking for a replacement soon :("
"April 16, 2020",mako Schultz,4.0,,This coffee pot broke back in late December.  I was sick and Don my husband's last issue was to worry about the brewer. We must used the Keurig but it's a hassle making 8 cips single every day. So I went to tea every other morning to help without a regular coffee pot.  We get this type without a carafe because of my hands I always drop and break even when not glass I do something to them. The last Hamilton Brewer I bought at Frye's lasted us years Maybe this route was not the right one. To last only 90 days!
"February 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"This is my second brew station and my last one lasted me 8 years making 2 full pots of coffee a day. (The best and never skipped a beat) We liked it so much, we talked another family member in to getting one, so we purchased two this time. * The new model design makes it tough to keep the counter tops dry. When you open the lid several hours later or the next morning, the lid has condensation water on it and once you open the lid to grab the coffee basket and tank to make another pot of coffee, condensation water runs off and all over the counter top and down the back of the coffee maker. * The old model design allowed the lid and tank to be completely removed and no condensation running everywhere. * The new model design also has issues while dispensing coffee and you must do so very easily. Don't press your coffee cup too hard on the dispense button or you will have coffee filling the overflow tray as you fill your cup. This is our experience with two new models but I will keep it otherwise, just bring paper towels with you every time you make coffee."
"November 3, 2017",Danielle,3.0,One,"We bought this coffee maker in Feb 2016, and have used it for a little under two years. It's been pretty great until recently. I like the timers, the ability to set how long you want the pot on, and not having a carafe to clean out (though we've been good about cleaning the machine regularly). Unfortunately, recently the coffee has begun to leak down into the water reservoir, which is both unpleasant to clean out and a waste of coffee. We're going to have to buy new machine, and it's frustrating to me that this one didn't even make it to the 2 year mark, when it's definitely not the cheapest machine on the market. I'm not sure if our machine is defective or is this is an ongoing problem, but I although I enjoyed this coffee maker, I wouldn't recommend it, just because the life of the machine seems to be so short."
"November 4, 2019",TheWayItIs,3.0,,"Blinding blue readout.  Would like to see some of that reflected to where the coffee comes out.  I personally dont like a lot of lights on in the morning. Timer works pretty good. Also, this has to be up against the wall, so it doesnt slide when the coffee cup is pushed against the release button.  Or you can hold the top and get a steam burn. Need a towel to empty speant coffee grinds b/c condensated water drips everywhere."
"October 29, 2018",Jo,2.0,One,"I have used these kinds of makers for over 10 years.  I recommend them to everyone ! But my last unit BOILS the coffee. I see people wrote that the company says this is normal ? If so, then why did the 4 previous makers NOT BOIL my coffee ? I am sorry but BOILING coffee is not ""fresh""  it's not ""normal"" it taste HORRIBLE ! and the back of the carafe is dangerously hot! burn your hand hot.  It's plastic ! it shouldn't be that hot ! I like a HOT cup of coffee, but this is ridiculous.  Way worse than any carafe.  SUPER DISAPPOINTED !"
"January 31, 2021",Ron Williams,1.0,,"This my 3rd one in over 15 years or so and always loved them.  But there is something wrong with this model, in that it leaks when you dispense coffee.  I returned one thinking it was defective but the 2nd one does the same thing.  I will try it for a couple of days and see how annoying this is, but I'll probably return this one and look for something else.  Very disappointing. After trying the 2nd one for 2 days I gave up and returned it and bought a regular carafe drip coffee maker.  Seems like a design flaw and not a defect of a single unit.  Too bad, I liked these for a number of years but the leaking problematic."
"August 11, 2014",AK,4.0,2,"I had two of these models. The first one was the 47950 model for home that I wound up returning and the second was the 48464 model which we used at our office and lasted a solid 26 months. I've had BrewStations before and have been pleased with them despite all their caveats listed in these reviews. 47950 review: I didn't realize one of these issues until I experienced it and only then noticed it after searching specifically on those key words.  The clock light has a bright blue background (with darker numbers) and the only way to dim it is to unplug the device.  (The stock photo and even the box has the colors reversed) So depending on where you decide to place this thing, it may be a deal breaker for you (it was for me - and had to return it). 48464 review: This thing lasted a solid 26 months brewing multiple full pots 5 days a week.  At around the 20 month mark, it stopped dispensing properly so I took it home and gave it a good scrubbing and cleaning (as per instructions) and it lasted another 6 months before finally giving out.  It still brewed coffee just fine, but was only able to dispense at a trickle.  So the work around was to remove the filter basket and just pour directly from the container.  It got a bit tricky when waiting for the brew to finish - but easy enough to turn it off, remove the container, and then power back on to resume the brew.  After a while it just got to be too much.  Fortunately, the $3 extended warranty through SquareTrade came in handy and they offered $35 reimbursement. (That basically works out to less than $.60/month rental fee). Overall - they performed very well - not perfect - but a solid 4.  I didn't replace either with Hamilton Beach models (went much higher end at home and back to the basics for the office) - but have been pleased thus far with their products."
"February 19, 2019",marianne DeAngelo,2.0,One,"While it makes a great cup of coffee, it’s clumsy to set up. There’s no permanent filter. I don’t like buying and using paper filters. To fill the water, you first fill the tank, then pou it into the unit. Because of the internal components and the angle to pour, water goes everywhere. The whole thing is plastic with feet in the back that fall out of their posts every time you move it, so does the drip tray. There is no light(which my Cuisinart did) at the pour port. The inside of my cups are black, so needless to say a lot of over pours! It is a third of the cost of my previous pots and does make a great tasting cup of coffee, so if you don’t care about the above concerns, this is the pot for you!"
"October 9, 2019",Frank Von Furstenrecht,5.0,,"I had to replace a stainless coffee pot that would not heat to the proper temperature any more.  I love this unit, so easy to use and it makes great coffee too.  Also, it takes less coffee to get the same result (taste) as the old one did.  It is so easy to prepare it for the next day to make coffee at a preset time, it shutting off after 4 hours of keeping it hot is also a welcome feature that is adjustable from 1 to 4 hours after it finishes brewing.  Love this unit!"
"April 8, 2016",popcornfanatic,2.0,One,"I've always had great luck with the Hamilton Beach coffee makers. I bought a fancier model last time and it always leaked out the bottom. The reservoir didn't sit evenly so pulling water over to the coffee pot was an issue. This particular model brews within itself and so hasn't got any leaking issues and it brews fast. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't make the beep indicating brewing is done and because the warming unit makes a loud boiling sound for about 15 minutes after brewing is complete.  I paid $3 for a 2 year warranty, so that was worth it. I hadn't done that with the other one and wihs I had. If I have to replace this one, I may move to black & Decker, as I tend to like their products. I buy HB because with the brewmaster style there's no carafe to break, no coffee boiling on a burner, no evaporating out the top. Coffee tastes wonderful and you get every drop you measured for. So, I'll see how this one goes. UPDATE 08/31- have to return it (I bought the warranty). This past week it slowed its brewing down immensely. And, after brewing the entire reservoir of water, the heating element no long shuts off or gives the signal the brewing is done. It gets louder and louder & smell like its burning. I'll see if I can get a replacement brewer. Update 9/1: Called Canopy, but they only handle the 2nd year (duh). The friendly rep gave me the number for Hamilton Beach, whose rep argued that the burning sound is normal for the entire time it is keeping it warm...even though its volume goes up SO loud that my neighbors think I'm grinding coffee beans at 5:15am. So, finally I find out it can be replaced... with the almost-$13 S&H fee, the cost of my own box, and a photo of the coffee maker after I cut the electrical cord as directed enclosed. The $29.88 +$3 extra warranty that I paid for the coffee pot isn't worth all that. Lesson learned: buy small appliances at Walmart or Target and get the replacement machine or refund $ back on the spot."
"August 24, 2019",RickT,2.0,,"I gave this two stars since it does made satisfactory coffee, but this design offers no advantage over a simple carafe coffee maker.  Contrary to some reviews this device is not ""easy to clean""; you can't put the reservoir in the dishwasher and after making a ""pot"" of coffee there is condensation everywhere with water dripping down to the heating element area when you lift up the coffee reservoir. The biggest issue is the low yield of coffee relative to the amount of water in the water reservoir.  Six cups in yields five cups out, the difference amounting to a combination of condensation, wet grounds and inaccessible coffee."
"December 18, 2020",S Gee,5.0,,"We love this coffee maker and have purchased it several times.  We make coffee every morning, and we love the convenience of not having a carafe.  Half asleep...all we have to do is place the cup under the dispenser....  With our last shipment, we noticed the product is shipped in its original carton.  Although it is made to be moved in a warehouse or retail setting,  I don't think the carton is designed for transportation/delivery on a truck.  The front piece of the coffee maker is a  little tweaked, but it's only cosmetic doesn't effect performance.  Just be sure to inspect the coffee maker upon receipt to be sure it is okay.  Other than that,  the coffee maker is a winner."
"May 11, 2020",Alicia Herron,2.0,,"We have been purchasing this coffee maker since we got married in 2011. Unfortunately the last 2 that we have purchased have had issues we could not over look. One, the lever where coffee is distributed was leaking so we exchanged it and the most recent one, the heat conducting plate cracked the plastic and has caused a leak in our machine every morning filling the reservoir with coffee each day and slowly leaking onto our counters. The previous models we've purchased had some leaking into the compartments I'm assuming are there for that purpose (the reservoir next to the 'carafe' that holds the coffee. I'm praying we can find a similar product or get a new one that doesn't have the same issues. We really love this design, the coffee tastes great and the clean up is better than a carafe."
"May 14, 2020",Lisa,5.0,,"When I was going into the office a little 5 cup coffee maker was perfect. Since I have been working from home since the beginning of March, making 2 pots a day was just not doing it for me. So I invested in this bad boy. I have to say that I was not disappointed. I love the fact the coffee stays with the coffee maker basin, so there is a hands-free push button to dispense the coffee so there is no spilling or dripping coffee to have to clean up. I would highly recommend this to anyone who really enjoys coffee."
"September 16, 2020",Karen,1.0,,"This the third HB coffee dispenser I have had. The first one I had for many years and finally replace it a few years ago with automatic timer on it! I have loved them, as has everyone who every had coffee with me! I love how the coffee dispenses and can keep it warm for up to four hours if you like. I have never had any problems with them so I ordered one for my mountain home. It has been a mess straight out of the box when I started using it. It leaks Underneath and doesn’t stop dispensing coffee when you remove your cup, and would leak down the front. I read you manual again and tried different coffee that was also the correct grind and had the same results. I see now that others have had the same problems! I wish that I had read the reviews before I ordered it, but I had already owned two so didn’t think it was necessary."
"February 5, 2021",Raymond,3.0,,Great idea. We have another similar one but the water tank is on the side whereas this is under the coffee tank. Have to remove everything in order to fill with water. That is inconvenient at best otherwise love it Well we returned the first one no problem. The problem was when filling your cup/tumbler there’s a dribble down behind where your cup is. Figured the first unit just might of had an issue.  Well second o e does the same thing right from the first cup.
"April 21, 2021",Sikaris,4.0,,"We like the coffee maker very much, and we’re going to keep it.…but…the area under the removable coffee tank on the right side would always have coffee that leaked into that area after every brew cycle. Instead of calling it in or returning it, I looked it over every which way to see if it was cracked in some way. It wasn’t a lot of coffee. No cracks were found. So the only way it was leaking was if there was a leak through the heating pan that is screwed into the bottom of the tank that holds the brewed coffee. I have a very small screw driver set, so I very carefully and slowly tightened the screws a little on the bottom of the brewed coffee tank. No leaks anymore! In the photos provided, the bottom of the tank where the screws are is shown that I tightened. The other photo shows where the coffee was accumulating on the right side under the brew tank."
"June 29, 2018",Asylum,1.0,2,"Started out working well. Then it it started collecting water near the heating element that would overflow and leak. Next it started leaking coffee from the reservoir, leaving a big mess in the counter. I had learned that this was caused by a bad gasket so I called Hamilton Beach.  They wouldn't send a replacement gasket and only wanted to sell me a new machine. Bad machine, bad service...never again."
"April 9, 2021",JayHG,1.0,,"I love this product, but mine is defective, and it's outside of the return policy period.  I bought it on December 2020, but it's leaking.  My old one started to leak, but it was after many, many years and it was time for a new one.  I searched all over and found this one on Amazon.  So disappointed, because I do love this type of coffee maker.  Don't know what to do right now because I can't return it.  I will just have to put paper towels under it each time I use it until it just starts to leak too much and then I will have to throw it out.  Again, so disappointed."
"October 6, 2020",sheree,5.0,,This coffee pot leaks really really badly. We loved our 1st coffee pot we bought 13 years ago but it wasn’t staying hot. Unfortunately for me we didn’t open the box for a couple months and now it’s too late to send it back. We have to put dish towels on the counter near the pot for the drainage. Also open your products before a month after purchase so you can return it in due time. We are wasting a lot of costly coffee from this disaster.
"May 16, 2020",Gina P.,1.0,,"Bought this after several years with the Cuisinart on-demand version which had declined in quality over the years (not draining the water from the tank/making coffee, leaks). As soon as it was out of the box it was clearly less quality - more plastic-y, something you would find in a hotel room. At first it brewed normally but within a few weeks we had issues. It does not make a full “pot” of coffee at once. You have to turn it off and on to get it to brew the entire pot. This is extremely annoying when you have it programmed for a morning brew and come downstairs only to find maybe a 1/3 of a cup of coffee - which is also cold! It is also very loud when it finishes each “cycle” making gargling noises. Will return if possible. Still looking for the perfect coffee maker!"
"January 2, 2021",Alicia,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. This is my third Hamilton Beach over the years and this is the best because of the separate reservoir. So convenient to fill. The coffee tastes great, stays hot for up to 4 hours (can be set from 0-4). A new feature that they didn’t have on my last machine is that it can be turned back on for additional time/to reheat coffee or keep it hot for longer. This is awesome for me, as I’m a busy mom and sometimes don’t get to my second cup until after the 4 hour mark. The iced coffee option is great as well. Be cautious of the gasket around the hot plate. If you are too rough in cleaning it, that piece can easily be damaged, which will make the machine leak. This is possibly what happened to my last machine."
"April 4, 2018",Mary Casey,5.0,,"I updated my review after hearing from customer service - coincidence that I got a reply after a negative review?  In any event, I love all the features and it worked great until suddenly dying after less than a year of light/moderate use.  I am getting a new unit but have to pay the shipping fee.  I think shipping should be included, but whatever.  Hopefully, the new coffee maker will last. I especially like - no carafe, easy to fill mug even during brew cycle, automatic shut off, programmable start, programmable ""keep warm"" feature, small pot brew feature, coffee strength feature, easy to clean."
"September 14, 2017",Cody G,1.0,2,"Don't like the design. I never would have guessed how much I would miss having a carafe, but I will never not have one again! This coffee pot has quite a few issues. 1) No Carafe, the usefulness and ease of cleaning of a traditional carafe is far superior. 2) Hard to clean. The upper portion of this (where the coffee sits) gets dirty and is super hard to clean 3) It is impossible to make coffee without spilling water. Opening the lid all the way spills water, so you have to learn to only open it half way. Taking the filter holder out spills water, so you have to actually take the entire top with you to the garbage to throw away the old filter to prevent spilling water. These issues outweigh the few pros this coffee maker come with which its competitors also offers."
"January 28, 2021",Joy U.,1.0,One,This is our second Hamilton beach coffee pot in this design.  The first one we had lasted for almost 4 years.  This one we bought in March 2020 and the flap on the bottom gave out.  We woke up to coffee all over the floor and counters.  Needless to say our Hamilton beach tour has ended and we are going with a different coffee pot.
"July 12, 2016",Cindy LaBoiteaux,4.0,2,"Really like the style of this coffee maker.  This is the third one of these that we have purchased in 8 years.  We really like the dispensing feature.  The first one (bought over 5 years ago) was my favorite - had a gauge so you could see how much coffee was left - and it was heavy enough that the unit didn't move when you pushed the dispenser to get coffee.  But, after about 5 years, it started leaking so we bought an earlier version of this one.  I miss the gauge and it is much lighter weight and you have to put your hand on top of it when you are dispensing coffee or it slides backwards.  We just purchased this third one for a second residence.  I was happy to see that it is a little heavier, so at least when the bucket is full, you don't have to hold it to dispense coffee.  It did come with some rubber ""feet"", probably to keep it from sliding when dispensing.  However, after morning coffee, we push this to the backsplash under the cabinet and, when doing so, the little feet popped right off - so not worth trying to keep them on.  I'd rather put my hand on the top when dispensing.  Definitely recommend ..."
"April 4, 2019",Roy Rhubright II,2.0,,"Loved it at first but now on our one. First one lasted almost 2 years. Worked great, have no complaints, until the dispenser started clogging and no matter how we cleaned it we could not get a decent flow rate. We ordered a new one figuring we got our money for it out of the other, same exact model, however the power indicator light did not work. all other functions were perfect, but we could not tell when the unit was actually on. We ordered a replacement under warranty, and the next one did the same exact thing. The red light on the top left side of the control panel does not work. this is very frustrating and we're getting ready to donate this one and go with another brand. Otherwise an awesome coffee maker and dispenser without the hassle of cleaning the glass pot."
"March 8, 2017",Joe,5.0,One,"I originally purchased its predecessor, model 48464, based on the excellent review by Consumer Reports.  In fact, it did far better in its reviews of the much more expensive coffee makers.  After many years of great coffee, my machine finally gave out.  Therefore, I decided to purchase the model 48465 (silver), which is the newer version of the model 48464.  This newer model is basically a knock-off of the older model.  This newer model makes the same, great-tasting coffee as its older sister.  The newer model 48465 has some nicer enhancement such as the silver facia, updated rectangular buttons, and a brighter LED display.  The filter basket and the coffee tank are identical in size to the older, 48464 model, so if one of them breaks on the newer model, I can  use it on the newer 48465 model.  My sister has a much more expensive coffee maker and this one beats it by far in overall taste of the coffee.  I don't understand the bad reviews like the individual who said that the heating plate got black after only a few days, or water is leaking from the sides.  I've never had those issues with either the older model and, or with the newer one. I can't recommend either the model 48464, which I previously owned, or the newer, model 48465.  You can't go wrong with either one."
"December 12, 2019",jane,5.0,One,"I LOVE this coffee maker! This is my third one in maybe 12-13 years. I love the fact you can make as much as you want as the number of cups is listed on reservoir. I love the fact you can adjust the brew style to Bold. I love the fact that I don’t have a carafe to worry about breaking and cleaning. This coffee maker is very easy to program! If I make the full 12 cup pot, and it doesn’t get consumed I save the leftover coffee(as it’s completely enclosed once brewed) and use it to make iced coffee. My only hope is that Hamilton-Beach never stops making this model."
"December 5, 2020",Cindy M.,5.0,,"I cannot express how much I LOVE this coffee maker!  I have had the Hamilton Beach coffee maker for years.  I always replace with the same kind.  This upgraded model is amazing! I can leave the coffee maker under the cabinet (where it belongs) to refill the water and the coffee!  I love the new features, too.  I can leave it on for up to 4 hours and it stays fresh!  And it makes 12 cups instead of 10 (which we all know is like 4) so I have plenty of coffee for us in the morning without needing to make that one more cup.  Absolutely perfect!  Has all the features I wanted and more that I didn't know I wanted until now!  Will definitely buy again!"
"October 18, 2020",Denise La Frossia,1.0,,"We were very excited early with the product and its coffee storage structure. But 4 months or so  into its regular usage we started to see some leakage. After daily cleanings of the countertop due to the everyday leaking, we stopped using the storage part of it and immediately transferred the made coffee into a thermos that we keep next to the coffee maker. Now, after having this device for only 8 months, the leaking starts almost immediately as the coffee starts to fill the storage unit. It is now a useless device, less than 1 year old! We have kept the device clean and follow all the instructions. The coffee maker was never misused. It is a poor product and will never purchase again."
"June 8, 2015",Freddi Scharf,5.0,26,"I keep waiting for this pot to 'fail' in some way. Some of the reviews were daunting....even saved the shipping box, anticipating a return. Bottom line: we love it. We plan to buy another for our RV."
"April 29, 2021",Keisha,5.0,,"Love this coffee pot, 10 hrs ago my mother bought me a coffee pot similar to this for Christmas one year... it’s nice that there’s not a pot sitting, which is super hot and children may touch the out or grab at it and spill it on them, I mean most parents keep an eye or their lil ones so this can’t happen, but accidents happen in the blink of an eye wit lil ones around... anyways I love this coffee pot style, obviously enough I bought a second one, it’s good coffee pot, easy to use, easy to clean does come wit instructions on how to clean etc."
"March 5, 2021",Jim F.,1.0,,"I ordered with out looking at Reviews.  My BAD  The item continues for sale o/l with many, many reviews telling of the very same problem.  The coffee makers and Amazon's BAD.  I have had 2 now and they both leaked profusely.  Doing nothing wrong as a consumer, the fault lies with the manufacturer---Hamilton Beach.  Over and over again--looking at the reviews, you will see this same leaking problem.  Someone should be ashamed for continuing to sell these coffee makers.  While extremely convenient, priced right, with quick delivery, they are useless when they leave a pond of hot brewed coffee unexpectedly, rather than coffee in the machine waiting to be dispensed and .enjoyed Someone ought to be ashamed.  jim f."
"April 22, 2020",Gerald D,5.0,,"We have had this coffee maker for a little over a month and it's done really well. It does make a little more noise and it drips water on the counter when you open the top of the carafe - but, hey, it makes really good coffee! Having a separate water reservoir on the side is a good idea to keep the heating mechanism cleaner. This is our third Hamilton Beach brewmaster and we like not having to pour out of a carafe. This unit is also shorter and fits in our tighter cabinet space. Yep, five stars as of right now."
"December 14, 2019",cat h,5.0,,"L♡VE IT!  We had a version of this years ago and absolutely loved it, But unfortunately it got broken and I did not even realize they made them Anymore and till I saw them on Amazon. We have a Keurig but this is so much more convenient when there are multiple people,  Keeps your coffee hot up to 4 hours! I took the bottom tray out and if I tilt a 8"" High, 28 oz cup, I can fill it!  I bought one of those  The Hamilton beach reusable filters to put in it . At 1st I was worried because it seemed very small, But it works perfect!"
"January 27, 2014",ThriftyGal,5.0,One,"This HB 12-cup is a vast improvement over the 10-cup HB programmable, no-carafe model that we recently replaced.  We were forced  to replace the old one when it inexplicably started smoking while plugged in but not turned on...yikes! Glad we were home and I happened to be in the kitchen when that happened!  Because of that mishap, I looked for everything BUT an HB brand to replace it.  I found that the HB really was the only coffeemaker that had everything we were looking for.  I'm really pleased with the design improvements on this new model.  The 12-cup is much better for us than the 10-cup capacity (2 adults drinking about 5-6 cups a day total between us).  The ""bucket"" on this one is easier to fill and clean and also includes a pour spout, and pouring water into the machine no longer involves craning your neck for those of us who are vertically challenged!  Easy to see, large numbers for the fill lines at below eye level.  Our generic permanent filter doesn't fit the coffee basket as well as the old HB, but it's not a big deal for us that the cover doesn't come down perfectly tightly, and this doesn't affect performance.  So, to recap, easier to clean, easier to fill, makes a great cup of coffee with more options for coffee strength, has an indicator for when it's time to clean the machine (nice and eco-friendly and cheaply with vinegar), easier to program, and the backlit clock/program window even doubles as a nightlite, and was the right price.  We're very happy with our new coffeemaker.  All that said, we've only owned it since the end of December 2013, about a month, so hopefully it won't start smoking or otherwise deteriorating in performance anytime soon."
"October 2, 2020",lynn divins,5.0,,"Bought it in June and it has failed already, rendering it unusable. The coffee reservoir leaks at the metal plate with the neoprene gasket (in the bottom of the reservoir) that is used for contact heat transfer. If left unattended for an hour or so, it will leak out a large quantity of coffee. It has been determined through cautious observation that it leaks immediately but takes some time to percolate down through the machine. All I need is a new coffee reservoir but it is not available (as of today last time I looked) at any parts place I found or at Hamilton Beach. I contacted Hamilton Beach customer service. ------ After contacting the manufacturer I ended up with a brand new coffee maker. It works well. This seems to be doing a fine job. Frankly my coffee maker before the broken one, was the same model and lasted for five years or more, so I expect a good five years out of this one. I believe the gasket issue was a fluke."
"June 17, 2020",Marsha Scott,1.0,,"I have had one in the past and absolutely loved it.  This brew station, (i have had this one for 2 months) however does seem to have issues.  Not easy to clean.  It constantly will clog up somehow n overflow a mess all over my counter n floor. I have cleaned it. Used distilled water so no build up.  Use less coffee grounds .  But it continues to overflow into the two small recessed reservoirs under the holding pot after the coffee has brewed.  I now can only make 4 cups at a time without problem of it not working properly.  Concept is great but i think i got the faulty one 😣"
"July 26, 2018",Gerry,5.0,One,"This machine makes a great cup of coffee. I love the internal storage, keeps it hot and ready to drink. I did have an issue after about 45 days use, the coffee maker quit before the water tank was empty. I contacted HB and they offered to replace the unit, but I decided to try cleaning it with white vinegar before replacing the maker. Well that worked and every time it acts up a vinegar cleaning takes care of my problem."
"July 20, 2016",DuxDlux,4.0,One,"Hard to break any new ground with a review of a product that's been reviewed this many times but I'll give you my experience after about a month of using it. We had inherited a Bunn that after years of service finally developed a leak so we were looking for something that would have the coffee brewed when my wife gets up for her commute at 4:30 AM. The positives on this HB maker so far are these: Price point is great and didn't want to spend $200+ on another Bunn. The no carafe idea is great, so no mineral buildup or coffee stains. Programming is easy and has worked as scheduled so far. Maybe it was because the Bunn was getting old but this keeps the coffee much warmer, which we like a lot. Maybe because of that hotter brew, but it seems like we're using less coffee to get a strong cup. The only negatives are these: It's kind of messy. When you lift the lid (after it's cooled) it has a tendency to drip condensation. Same with lifting out the basket or the filling jug. I just wipe the lid down with a paper towel before I lift it all the way. Drips a little here and there from the spigot but nothing bad. As others have said it's kind of noisy when brewing but you get used to that. Lastly, I would say this is just speculation, but the build quality doesn't seem great and I have a feeling it won't last too long. But again, for the price, if it works for a few years it will be a pretty good buy. Overall 4 stars and very close to being really good and innovative. Just needs a few tweaks. I would definitely recommend though, especially for the money."
"January 2, 2016",Ann,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  This is my third machine.  They don't break down, but I make coffee everyday, sometimes twice a day and after 2-3 years of constant use the machines get messy and slightly leaky.  I am diligent about running a cleaner through the machine every three months or so.  The coffee dispenser has a very small filter that gets clogged over time, which causes the coffee to come out in a small, slow stream.  To extend the life of the machine,  I take the dispenser apart about once a year and clean the tiny, domed filter.  This is a fairly easy task requiring a little patience and a phillips screwdriver.  This area of the machine also has a tiny rubber washer that gets worn out and over time allows the coffee to dribble after dispensing.  The only negative I've found is that I find the the water basin difficult to fill.  The basin is black making it difficult to see how much water is in the reservoir.  There is a water gauge but I still find it difficult to see.  Other then that I really don't have any complaints.  It's a really great coffee maker at a very reasonable price."
"January 16, 2020",toni perez,1.0,,"I bought this coffee pot I love how it is set up to pour one cup at a time with the reservoir on the side. But it was loud and constantly made a hissing sound. I thought it was deffective so I sent it back and had you send me a new one if the same kind. This one still makes the same noise it is just a loud hissing coffee pot. 😪 I wouldnt reccomend it. It was not cheap and should not sound like that everytime i mske coffee. My old machine was very similar even a little less expensive, but never sounded loud like this one!!! I'm sorry but I can not reccomend this coffee machine."
"January 16, 2021",dave,2.0,,"we just purchased a Hamilton Beach 48456 Coffee Maker Jan 2021 to replace last one we bought in Jan 2017. The new one leaked just behind where the coffee comes out. So we returned it for another one. The 2nd new one leaked as well from the same area. When the coffee comes out into your cup, some coffee travels backward away from the downward stream and drips down just above the button you push in for coffee. Rather than look for a different brand, it turned out to be an ease fix. I took the spring lever and seal assembly out of the one from 2017 and used it in the new coffee maker. “No More Leak” it now has a straight downward stream with no travel back. Included in this review is 2 photos of the new coffee maker spring lever and seal. It has a yellow round seal, the one from the 2017 coffee maker is black. The 2 seals are made from 2 different types of material. “They feel different to the touch”.  for us it worked to keep this new coffee maker due to the fact we were able to swap parts. hope this helps someone else. Note to the Manufacturer “Change the round seal material back to what was used on the 2017 modle. “"
"January 9, 2020",Perry E.,1.0,,"I bought this because I needed more output than the six cup Hamilton Beach model (Which is AWESOME).  This one, even with the Bold Setting makes very weak coffee. I do not know what it is. This is now in the garbage (Missed the return window) and I am back to my Six Cup Hamilton Model. I cannot believe that this product can be so POOR compared to it's sister product, even though they share the same design. Very disappointed."
"May 14, 2020",OCBob,2.0,,"I have owned this coffee maker for about three years. It has performed ok but never great. The coffee never stays warm despite the thermal carafe. In fact it is not even that hot when first perked! The clock on the display simply disappeared after about a year. The the clip that holds the water reservoir to the rest of the machine broke off. Overall, it made decent coffee but was never great. I'm sending it to the landfill now."
"July 24, 2016",T.T,5.0,2,"I've used this type before, yeah Hamilton Beach no carafe makers. I always seem to go back to them. It's more convenient to have coffee pouring from the maker and not have to use a carafe that is subject to breaking. That is the most important thing here for me. Breaking a carafe, potentially getting cut in the process. Plastic coffee holder, no breaking, pour and go.  End cycle beep has a low tone, not loud at all. Yeah, I can set it for brewing at a particular time. Coffee stays hot, not scalding hot. Putting water in the brewing hold is easy and 2 sided, you can use either side to pour water. There is a gray plastic water line measurement level to see how much water you're pouring in, water measurements on the side of the coffee-water bucket. Easy to clean. The little drip tray is removable for washing. You can also time how long you want your coffee to stay hot. Up to 4 hours."
"January 18, 2013",Aimee R,5.0,7,"I have had a cheap Mr. Coffee coffee maker for the last 10 years.  I'm not putting down the brand, it was just generic, with an on/off switch and nothing special.  It was exactly what you expect a 20 dollar coffee maker would be.  I decided it was time for an upgrade, as my morning cup of coffee is sometimes the highlight of my day.  While researching, I looked at all styles and prices.  I could not see myself getting a Keurig or anything else that was priced in the hundreds of dollars.  Not for a cup of coffee... not even for the best cup of coffee ever. I found this brewmaster.  It was a very reasonable $$39.99, well below the 90 dollar self imposed limit i set.  I read ALL the reviews, both negative and positive and was a little worried.  I shouldn't have been.  It is a great coffee maker. Based on other reviews I just want to say: 1) The coffee is hot.  For the entire time I keep the warmer on.  Is it scalding hot? no.  But I like to actually taste my coffee and not burn my tongue. It is hot enough to dissolve the sugar and creamer, and I still have to blow on it a little before drinking. 2) I have multiple cups of different sizes and widths.  I have had no problem using any of them.  No spills, leaks, or problems. 3) I have had no other leaking problems.  Yes, at the end of the day, when I open the top to clean the filter, dump the leftover coffee and reload for the next morning, there is a little condensation that drips from the top.  In my opinion, thats perfectly normal. 4) The timer and display works perfectly. I am not discounted anyone elses review.  Just wanted to let others know that I have had NONE of the issues others have stated.  I think it is a great value for the money.  After using this coffee maker, I can honestly say I would have paid double for it."
"June 10, 2020",Heather,1.0,,"This coffee pot was really cool at first. The feature of the dispenser is a wonderful idea however it’s better to push the button and hold your cup rather than use your cup to push it in. The heating element on the inside will start to burn the coffee if it is to low. The coffee pot then started leaking all of the coffee at a slow pace. I finally noticed that it was leaking from the corner of the heating plate. I checked out the screws , they were tight so with out ordering an entire new tank, there was no fix. Poor design but could be really cool. Best news, the return for amazon ran out 1 week ago so now I get to fight with the manufacturer.  Amazon customer service helped me work through this an I ordered a different coffee pot. With Covid the manufacturer has no one answering the phone. So amazon stepped up to help. Thanks Lorenzo!"
"August 29, 2014",Daniel Scurlock,2.0,One,"UPDATED 2014 NOV 30 Updating the review after extended use of coffee maker.  Dropping to two stars. ************************* BEGIN UPDATE The constant noise and the *massive* amount of condensation were just too much. The unit would have between a 1/2"" and 3/4"" of water in the base after every pot of coffee and was getting to be a huge pain to pull out paper towels and sop up the condensation on a daily basis.  We ended up picking up a Mr. Coffee maker for less than half the cost that also does 12 cups of coffee and oh my, the sounds of silence, and not having to sop up water after every pot of coffee! END UPDATE ************************* We have been through several Hamilton Beach coffee makers over the years, and when the last unit died we upgraded to this model.  It makes good coffee, but there are a couple of minor issues that we had not encountered with the previous units. 1: Even after the coffee has finished brewing there is a constant noise. Kind of a bubbling/brewing sound that doesn't go away until the unit is powered down.  It's disconcerting to hear the coffee maker making brewing noises well after the coffee has completed brewing. 2: The inside of the unit where the coffee filter is placed has a LOT of condensation. When you lift the coffee filter holder there is quite a bit of water sitting at the bottom. We initially thought it was this extra water that was causing the brewing sound, but even after wiping the condensation dry it still makes the noise. Minor issues, but the older models of Hamilton Beach coffee makers did not have them. We'll keep using the coffee maker until it dies, but will try a different model next time."
"April 3, 2020",mvb,4.0,,"As another reviewer observed, the problem of weak coffer with the 1-4 cup setting happens because the layer of coffee is shallow, and the water runs through it quickly, not having the chance to steep as it would dripping through a deeper deposit of coffee.  My husband solved this by removing the bottom of a quart-size yogurt container, cutting the resulting plastic tube down to 2 ½ inches, placing the tube in the basket (thereby making the basket smaller) and placing the filter within the plastic tube in the basket.  When you add the coffee, it isn't as spread out and shallow a layer, and the water has a greater depth of coffee to drip through.  Delicious coffee--providing you also ignore the directions on the coffee maker that suggest 1Tbsp. coffee per 6 oz. cup; as with other coffee makers, you need 2 Tbsp. per 6 oz. cup.  I drink a single, large mug of coffee and therefore use 4 Tbsp."
"July 7, 2018",Linda K. Shoults,5.0,2,This replaced a Cuisinart in our master bedroom coffee bar - I get coffee in bed every morning.  So far the only complaint I have heard from my spouse who makes the coffee is that it doesn't have a light to illuminate the mug as he is filling it with the coffee.  The temperature of the coffee is consistent and we set it to turn off in two hours.  Haven't experienced any bitterness at all.  The aroma is wonderful and the brew time maybe little longer than the Cuisinart but we are happy with the coffee maker.
"July 4, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"After my old Hamilton Beach Flex Brew finally conked out on me, I decided to try something different. I read the reviews on this Hamilton Beach Brew Station and really liked the idea of a carafe-free coffee maker. This was such a disappointment. I love strong/bold coffee and all the reviewers said it made bold coffee. No. The ""bold"" setting on this coffee maker is weaker than my old coffee maker's ""regular"" setting. Even my husband, who didn't like strong coffee, said it was weak. I wondered how strong it would be when it made the bold coffee in 15 minutes. The only way I've gotten it to be as bold as my old maker made it is to use twice the amount of coffee grounds. That's a no-go for me. I also have the issue of coffee leaking down the back over the dispense button as I'm pouring coffee into my mug. It leaks down onto drip pan but doesn't go into the drip pan. It goes around all the holes and off the front onto my countertop. It did this the very first time I used it and has done it every time since. None of the reviews I saw mentioned this issue. I've used this for 3 days now and I'm done. I'm sending it back and getting something else."
"September 20, 2015",Melinda Wind,2.0,,"We've owned other BrewStation units over the years, and use them two or three times a day most days.  We have another drip coffee maker, so while these are sometimes used for morning coffee when we're making more than one kind, we most commonly use the Brewstation to have hot water on hand for tea, instant oatmeal, hot chocolate, etc.  The units we've had previously required the carafe portion to be lifted off in order to fill the water tank, so we were looking forward to this model with the side reservoir. The item arrived in the product box with no other wrap or outer packaging.  I'm glad it wasn't going to be a gift as the box was dinged and had adhesive labels attached.  Upon unpacking, it seemed as though this BrewStation felt cheaper than previous models. With use, we noted that the side reservoir didn't fit snugly against the brewing unit, but leaned outward.  Whether this was due to a defect or poor design and manufacturing, who knows.  The dispensing lever required us to have our mugs in just the right spot when pushing in order to get a full stream of water.  The force required was also a LOT more than any other unit we've owned.  When pushing the dispenser, the entire machine would slide across the counter unless we held it down tightly with one hand. After two days of painstaking use, we found this BrewStation with it's possible defect and huge inconveniences to be more trouble than it was worth and packed it up for return.  It's getting two stars only because it did make water suitably hot for tea."
"November 5, 2020",Martha Humphreys,1.0,One,"Expect to replace it regularly when the lever that pours the coffee cup breaks after a few months. This is the second unit I purchased, and I will not be purchasing another one or anything else from  Hamilton Beach as they do not stand by or support their products. Nor do they respond to queries about this or any other product. Perhaps they've gone out of business? Who knows? They are not reachable by phone and do not respond to email contact. Next time, buy Cuisinart:"
"October 26, 2019",Meg.,1.0,,"This product was delivered to me 8/5/19. I put it on my kitchen counter and never moved it. Upon opening and setting up, the water reservoir wasn’t flush with the rest of the coffee maker. By 10/14/19, the coffee reservoir had a crack in it, was leaking, and I emailed Hamilton Beach customer service. They told me warranty was only valid for first 30 days after purchase or you have to pay to ship the new item and apt to ship the old one back. I opted not to sink any additional money into this product or company."
"January 31, 2020",Kathleen McGovern,4.0,,This is my second Brewstation.  I owned the first for many years. I love the convenience of the push feature to fill my cup. The internal storage keeps the coffee fresher and prevents it from evaporating which would leave the last cups overly strong. This newer model is a little more awkward to pour the water into the brewing section. It's a bad angle. It is also harder to clean the storage container because this model has plastic parts that stick up so it isn't a smooth wipe with a sponge. I decided to keep it despite these changes in design because I like the cup filling feature. I hope the next model has these issues worked out.
"December 20, 2012",G8RED,4.0,2,We have owned another Hamilton Beach and it leaked after about two years of use. Then we owned a Quisinart DCC-3000 and  the gauge in front stopped working after a few months and the entire machine stopped working after about one year of use. We have only owned this for a few months so I can not say how long it will last but I like the design better then any of them. I really like the ease of use in being able to take the water container off from the side for simple filling. Also the coffee and filter sections come out easy for easy cleaning and replacement. The only things I can nit pick on are.... * Coffee is not as hot as the other machines we have owned. What I do is run the water in the sink until it is hot and then place the water container under it to fill up. This does help make the coffee generally hot enough for use. * Pressing the coffee mug to the push button to get the coffee to pour seems to be a little harder to do then the others (but not a big deal). This is a solid unit and I would recommend it to anyone. UPDATE: Almost two months after getting this we decided to go crazy and we purchased a Nespresso Latissima Plus. We love the combination of the two. The Nespresso brews the perfect espresso/cappuccino along with any froth milk/coffee option we want. Next we just purchased Keurig's new Vue700 because I did not like the smaller coffee sizes the Nespresso made. The Vue700 is supposed to make cups from small to extra large along with a bunch of other stuff. We have not even taken delivery of it yet. So the bottom line is we now have a mini-Starbucks in our house but for inexpensive coffee making we are still very happy with this Hamilton Beach brew station.
"April 24, 2014",Ken M,4.0,One,"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros: -On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons: -If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it. ken"
"May 10, 2021",Jeremey,3.0,,"This machine makes a perfectly fine cup of coffee, on par with any other drip coffee maker I’ve ever used. It’s getting the coffee out of the machine that’s the problem. This coffee maker is really light weight and the dispenser button requires a decent amount of force to work. When you put those two things together you get a coffee maker that slides across your counter when you try to get coffee out of it. Hamilton Beach should either weigh the thing down a bit or out suction cup feet on the bottom."
"March 10, 2018",Reebs6691,1.0,One,"I've had this coffeemaker for a little over 6 months now and am already shopping for a new one. I don't use the keep warm function because, as another reviewer noted, it makes the coffee taste burnt. A more recent development has been leaking. I've had to keep a tray underneath to catch coffee that leaks out when the dispenser lever is pressed. I've tried cleaning and placing my mug differently and nothing seems to work. Coffee leaks out along the front side every time I press the dispenser. I initially liked this coffee maker, but this leaking makes it miserable to use. Even though this was relatively affordable, 6 months is a little too short of a lifespan for me. I do not recommend."
"May 28, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"It's a great coffee maker... simple to use. Good features... schedule start time, brew strength, keep warm options etc. However at the end of each tank,  EVERY tank, the pour spout dribbles coffee down the front of the maker, over the pour button, down the side of the cup so that when you set the cup down it leaves a sloppy coffee ring on the counter. I took the filter housing apart once to see if cleaning it would help... it was a chore to clean it... that helped for a few days then it started again. It's messy to use every day. Would not purchase again."
"January 13, 2021",sheree,1.0,,THIS is the second coffee pot from Hamilton Beach I purchased on Amazon.  By the time I started using the first Coffee maker it was too late to return so I was stuck with it.  So i bought another Hamilton Beach the same kind and I cant believe it LEAKS worst then the 1st one.  it makes a mess and i am so bummed.  I cant believe that within a year 2 pots have the same severe leaking.  I wont buy another one from here.
"April 18, 2020",Betty,3.0,,"This model is not as nice as the other model I have. This is hard to fill, the water spills all over the counter. The dispenser part is also not great. Coffee runs down the back/side of the cup regardless of how I try to position it. The other unit I bought last November and that has a separate water unit to fill and put in place, no pouring. I'm disappointed but can't return because I discarded the packaging."
"December 21, 2020",Jennifer,1.0,One,The press button goes too far back causing coffee to run onto the lever and down the front of the maker.  So every morning we have a puddle on the counter and rings on the table because our mugs are always drippy.  We’ve had two of the previous models of these and loved them-the ‘updates’ with this new model have ended our love affair.
"July 6, 2019",Mary,5.0,,"We are coffee snobs and usually brew our coffee by hand, pouring the hot water over the grounds. But there are times when it's nice to get up in the morning and just press a button. We were in a hotel this past winter and they had this type of coffee brewer so we bought one. It's really well designed. The water is measured and poured from the same place it is brewed into so there isn't a separate container to fuss with. Clean up is also easy for that reason. The coffee grounds' basket then fits in on top of it. Settings included are useful, such as how long you want to wait before the coffee maker turns itself off. And the interface is simple so guests can easily figure it out. Highly recommended."
"November 30, 2020",Donald L. Everhard,1.0,,"I am on my second one of these in the past 30 days and I am returning this one as well due to it leaking. The concept is great with single cup dispensing but as you dispense......coffee runs down behind your cup. At the end of each day you have a lot of coffee under the machine,  so much so you have to keep the coffee maker on a towel.  It just makes a mess. If the machine didn't leak it would be great but I'm 0 for 2 so I'm looking for a different brand."
"February 6, 2016",Annesg,4.0,3,"I love the Brewstation - this is my fourth.  I saw that it has been updated with more SS, but it is not the same.  I read the reviews and noticed lots of complaints of leaks but thought I really like the brewstation and ordered it and cautiously used it.  There is a major flaw in its redesign;  there is lots of condensation created, it does not evaporate, but collects under the coffee reservoir on either side of the heating element.  I make the full pot everyday, if I do not remove the reservoir and take out the water that has accumulated underneatht I would absolutely have water all over. I have to say it's a substantial amount, at least a couple of ounces per pot.  Now part of my coffee routine, after rinsing/cleaning reservoir I make sure that this excess water is removed (several paper towels or dishtowel) before putting the coffee reservoir along with the filter basket.  It is a pain but it's worth this step, I love the coffee and the convenience of dispensing one cup at a time.  UPDATE:  it seems the problem has been fixed......no leaks......love my brewstation !!!"
"July 7, 2020",Bologna Pie,2.0,,"I’ve had my Hamilton for four months. I use it At least once every day. I want to love this brew station, but I don’t. First, it leaks water. I have no idea why and I can’t figure out from where I’m the back or the bottom. Secondly, it stops brewing at about 4 cups, requiring you to turn it off and turn it back on to get a full pot. I have a different Hamilton Station, which had a lot less problems. I should’ve kept the old slow model. If I were you I’d keep looking."
"August 3, 2020",GUS THE PHONE GUY,2.0,,"I had trouble with my coffee maker because the “clean” indicator wouldn’t turn off, even after repeated cleanings.  They were very quick to send me a new one, even without me having to return the original.  The second one dribbled the coffee all over the place when trying to fill a cup.  I now use a combination of the two.  It works but sometimes it still dribbles and what’s worse it leaks, from the bottom  and leaves coffee all over my counter when I slide the unit in or out from under the cabinet above it.  It is too high to fit under a cabinet with the top open for filling or cleaning, so I am constantly having to mop up the counter.  NOT HAPPY"
"May 17, 2016",mellon,2.0,One,"I wanted to give it more stars.  I really did, but the novelty wore off.  This coffee maker is interesting to say the least.  It keeps your coffee nice and warm for up to 4 hours and there is no separate carafe to deal with.  Cool, but now 6 months after purchase - I can not get this thing to make coffee for the life of me.  I have used filtered water and have not over used this machine.  It has not even had daily use.  When it worked properly the only gripe is that sometimes you need to hold the machine down to press firmly enough to get coffee.  In general, it is a decent machine.  Does not burn the coffee at all. I read online that running vinegar through it a few times should do the trick.  I get the dreaded ""fill water"" error when the machine is already full.  A few times I was able to get it to shake loose by inserting a stir rod down to the bottom of the tank and manually depressing the red button that controls water intake.  I have spent far too much time screwing around with this machine.  I think I am going back to the old tried and true carafe design."
"May 17, 2021",deanna thompson,1.0,,"The first coffee maker I had worked great for the first 6 months and then coffee started leaking on to the counter.  I reached out to the manufacturer and they sent out a replacement, which I appreciated.  I have been using the replacement for 13 months and it is now doing the same thing!  It leaks all over the counter.  I tried contacting the manufacturer and they have not responded this time.  I am so disappointed that it is leaking again."
"October 10, 2016",Terry,2.0,3,"I have had the product just over 1 year and it is having issues pouring and the control panel is playing up. the cleaning light keeps flashing after being cleaned and the power button is a hit or miss when you try to keep it pressed in to re-heat the coffee.  It is a good unit, better than the normal coffee makers which stew your coffee. but do not expect it to last more than 13 months, do yourself a favor and buy the 2 year extended warranty for 3 bucks and then claim a new one!!! no use contacting Hamilton beach, they will tell you its out of warranty!! poor show seeing it was about 1 week after the year was up! They have offered me a 40% discount? so they must know something about these units? what happened to the days when you purchased an appliance and it lasted 5-10 years??"
"May 30, 2016",Bethany Perkins,3.0,One,"UPDATE: sadly it's acting funny already. It takes 20 min or more to finish brewing a half pot of coffee, I have cleaned it several times and it still says it needs to be cleaned. Also the coffee isn't hot when it's first done, but sits and boils (audibly) instead of ""gently warming"" it as it sits on the ""keep warm"" setting. I can't request a replacement from Amazon because it's outside of the 30 day return window. Even though it's probably broken. Previous review: I doubt I'll ever buy a different coffee maker. I really love this one :) owned it for Many years until the screen started acting up and the coffee wasn't really getting hot enough. Couldn't bring myself to get a different machine! I re-researched and everything and this is still the best for your money."
"April 29, 2020",R,3.0,,"I really like the concept of this coffeemaker. It does require pretty frequent cleaning, though. Not all the water in the reservoir will go through the coffee maker if it hasn’t been cleaned recently. Part of it is our hard water, but there’s also the heating element inside where the coffee stays hot. It is a flat surface that sits just above the coffee when there is about a cup left. Coffee will burn onto the heating element and be hard to clean off. The dispensing method is convenient, though."
"May 25, 2016",Desert Rose,5.0,2,"I have purchased two of these.  The first one lasted several years.  I bought the second because I really like the side lift off water container.  It is so much easier than opening the top and pulling out the tank, filling it, pouring the water back in, and replacing the tank.  Filling the side container and setting it back on the coffee maker is much more convenient.  I also like not having a glass coffee pot on the bottom, which is just one more thing to clean.  Filling my cup directly from the machine is more convenient.  I accidentally purchased a similar coffee maker by the same company but gave it away because it did not have the side tank that I like so much.  Then found this one and purchased it instead."
"January 8, 2021",Nana,2.0,,"My son has this model and recommended it. However the dispenser bar leaks anytime you push to dispense coffee. Also, it was a bit too much work making coffee, adding water was not convenient and not the easiest to clean. Although a great concept for dispensing coffee, it just didn’t work for me.  The stainless steel looks modern but was a PIA to keep maintained. I returned it as defective due to leaks, smudges, fingerprints, water marks and not that easy to operate."
"February 7, 2015",Algesan,3.0,One,"I like Hamilton Beach coffee makers overall, since my last three have all been one. Good coffee makers for someone who drinks coffee all day. This one, I got hooked on the nonremovable reservoir model at church so when it got time to replace mine, this looked like the solution since the removable reservoir would make it easier on my wife to fill without having to lift a carafe of water over her shoulders. Pros: Makes a good pot of coffee fairly quickly. Ability to dispense like a drink machine. Keeps coffee hot enough to enjoy for several hours (good for my habits whereas the thermal carafes end up with the last couple of cups a little cool). Lots of nice ""bling"" features like fluid level windows and settings. Cons:  The infamous condensation & drip issue which makes for a puddle under and around the machine. Reservoir does not fit firmly to the coffee maker. Which leads to occasional leaks at the connection between reservoir & machine. So, pretty much, the water damage potential, cost of laundering extra towels, etc. kills any chance of this being a permanent member of my house.  I'll go back to the thermal carafe machines."
"September 16, 2016",chef sheshe,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot!  I have had it for about 6 months now.  It is easy to fill with cup markers on the filling part and the reservoir.  The ease of pushing a button to dispense the coffee is something I never knew I needed before.  And I don't regret using ""keep warm"" for 4 hours; I have yet to have the burnt taste I have experienced in the past with a carafe style pot.  You can even use it to make iced coffee...something I must have missed when I was looking to purchase (but a bonus!). The system itself is somewhat large, but I have the space on my counter for it.  One small flaw is in the design of the lid for the top.  It comes out of place and is time consuming (and frustrating) to get back in. I prefer this to the Keurig system myself.  It is just as fast to brew a cup and faster than most at brewing a pot."
"May 8, 2020",Darren Milner,1.0,,"We had one of these for a few years, but then it started leaking massive amounts of coffee after brewing. Investigation revealed that underneath the brew pot, there is a heating element that is screwed in with a gasket. I don't know why it took a couple of years for this to start happening, but once it happened, we would have to begin routinely tightening those screws every week or so, else the machine would start leaking all over. We used a different coffee maker for a year, and then decided to get another one of these. This time, the unit started leaking with the exact same problem, but only 4 months into it. I love the design, I love the concept, and I love the way it makes coffee. However, this is cheap garbage, and Hamilton Beach has to know it's a manufacturing defect, as a simple google search reveals MANY MANY MANY people have this same issue."
"April 26, 2017",Betty,5.0,5,"Bought the same model about 12 years ago and it finally gave out. I was so excited to find this on amazon for a little bit cheaper than the stores, with my prime it was at my house in two Days! We love the style of this coffee pot! There are so many positive things...no carafe, separate water tank that is removable, easy to clean, easy to program and it really keeps your coffee piping hot for up to 4 hours. The buttons and display are lit well and easy to see. Our last one lasted for over 12 years with daily use so we really trust this brand and the workmanship of their products."
"May 23, 2021",Fred R Jordan,1.0,,Terribly disappointed with this coffee pot! I have been using this style for over 10 years and loved the fact I didn't have to use the glass pot that needs constant cleaning and can crack.  This coffee pot however leaked so badly every time I pressed the cup to the pot that it was a mess.  Even  after complaining about to customer service nothing has been done to replace it or refund my money.
"September 11, 2020",Dave K.,2.0,,"This coffee maker seemed like a great idea. I mean no carafe, right? I’ve had it 4 months. Well, despite it making good coffee, it is super messy. Pouring the water in is almost always a messy adventure. Then, dispensing coffee? Also messy. Your cup always get coffee on the bottom and leaves rings everywhere if you don’t keep a paper towel handy. It dribbles, leaving a constant mess in catch basin. If you lift the whole thing up, there’s always black stains/puddles on your countertop. Bottom line. Great concept, but you end up doing a lot of cleaning up."
"January 24, 2021",Kindle Customer,2.0,,"The coffee maker is OK. But, cheaply made. The vessel to put water in comes apart from the machine very easily. There could be a track to slide it in, but there isn't. The drain at the bottom barely fits in, doesn't click in or anything. Makes coffee fine, I like the push button, one-handed way to fill a cup, but I have a feeling this coffee maker will not last long before something falls off of it."
"September 26, 2019",Jammer,5.0,,"I hate coffee that has a strong, bitter taste and which leaves an aftertaste in your mouth!  The k-cups were just not doing it for me so I decided to try the Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Coffee Maker, Programmable BrewStation Dispensing Coffee Machine.  I'm so glad I did.  The programmable feature and built-in coffee reservoir are great.  The warming feature is programmable and will keep heating the coffee in reservoir for up to several hours.  When I say ""warm"" I really mean ""hot"".  No tepid coffee!  This machine is a keeper.  I've only had it a week so I cannot vouch for its durability but it is easy to use and very easy to clean. The coffee I use is Community Coffee and it tastes great!  No more too strong, bitter, leave an aftertaste in your mouth coffee for me!  Even my wife, a die-hard k-cup advocate, agrees!"
"June 26, 2021",Patricia Emily,1.0,,"The lid won't stay attached on the pot ! It dispenses coffee all over the place and makes a mess. Very disappointed in it ! The heating unit doesn't regulate the temperature and you have to shut the pot off to keep it from boiling, now it is constantly leaking coffee out of the dispenser !  Every day something else goes wrong with it !  Not the product quality I expect from Hamilton Beach .."
"March 4, 2021",William,3.0,,"This is a fun little machine that makes good coffee... but there us a major design flaw in it. I contacted customer service for the first one and they sent a replacement right away, but the problem persists. This unit leaks down the button area and fills the drip tray very quickly.  This leak occurs only when you are trying to fill your cup but literally make 8 cups of coffee and only get to drink 6 of them. It is a lot of waste and it is a lot of mess. I'm very disappointed with this unit and really wish I had known ahead of time. I would have got something else. Don't waste your time or money."
"April 2, 2020",Real Estate Broker Near DC,5.0,,"I usually buy the stainless steel look and wasn't sure how I would like the all black.  I'm thrilled with it!  The numbers are easier to read on this model than my old upgraded version of this coffeemaker.  I thought long and hard whether to buy this, Bunn or Ninja - and am happy I decided to stick with the BrewStation by Hamilton Beach.  The look on the counter is great and adds another touch of class to the kitchen!  The only thing I would change is that non-skid feet on the bottom of the appliance would be a slight bit helpful, but only when it is low on remaining coffee."
"October 21, 2019","Glenn L. , Wilmington NC",5.0,,"I replaced an inexpensive maker with this a few months ago.  Amazon sale price was attractive and liked the concept of not glass pot. Brews beautifully and I set it up in the evening so coffee is ready and hot upon waking. Easy clean , I wash the ""coffee holder"" every day in the sink to keep it fresh and put the grounds holder in the dishwasher. Especially like that you can fill the ""water holder"" at the sink and attach it to the unit...no more pouring water into unit with too small an opening making a mess every day on the counter top...no more mess as with pouring from a carafe into the mug. Only negative is that it slides easily when cup is pushed to get coffee from unit, needs to be against the back splash for support (which works for me) or on a rubber mat to prevent sliding. I am not a fan of ""keurig"" type units as I grind my beans every evening , my grinder is right beside this unit so very convenient. I highly recommend this unique way of brewing good coffee easily."
"November 26, 2017",Chris DeBerry,5.0,5,"I was skeptical because of the low cost as I was getting rid of a $100 Hamilton Beach brewer that lasted over 7 years...the old one didn’t stop working, I was just ready for something new.  I mostly drink iced coffee so I love the “keep warm hours” function as well as the “bold” setting. The water tank lifts off easily for filling and is way light, as well as the coffee tank for cleaning. The look is fine, up close you can see where costs were saved (the stainless on the tank side is that cheaper stuff) but who is going to care/inspect from a foot away. I’m kind of an OCD person so the tank looking like it’s leaning to the right is something I’ve gotten over because this thing rocks! Lol. I’ve had it for close to a month and can’t foresee any problems in the immediate future based on how it is operating thus far."
"February 14, 2017",Carrie U,5.0,,"On a daily basis I use my Keurig but I decided to buy this coffee maker for when we have a lot of company staying at my house around the holidays.  My parents have this at their house for the exact same reason so I was somewhat familiar with how it worked.  I was shocked to see that it was only around $30!  I thought it would be a lot more expensive.  I was about to spend $80 on k-cups so it was definitely a deal to me.  So far I haven't had any problems with it.  It keeps the coffee hot for hours, the coffee pours out great, and it is easy to clean.  If guests aren't visiting, I only use it around once or twice a month so I can't say how well it holds up if used every day but for me it suites my needs."
"November 16, 2015",Phx85021,3.0,One,"Well made, works better than I expected.  I like the idea of it being a dispenser, and doing away with a carafe. Easy to clean drip tray.  Some (maybe most) sports bottles/tall mugs don't fit squarely under the spout, but that's a small inconvenience.  I like the extended warming feature.  I would have given it five stars, but I want to be sure it works for an extended period.  So far so good. Purchased 09/23/15 Addendum: It's been 3 years. Functionally, I've had no problems. However, from the start, the coffee it produces is off-tasting. It's not actually BAD, just muddied, regardless of the grade of coffee I buy, and I've found that the coffee most places serve is better than what the HB produces. Then there is the matter of extended heating. If you like your coffee burnt black, then you'll love this. Mechanically it gets 5 stars. Taste-wise, only 2 stars. I've ordered a K machine."
"April 2, 2016",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Updated review after 8 months of ownership: Unfortunately, it seems moisture seeped into the electronic controls. The buttons became very sketchy for programming and now the LED screen just flashes ""E03"" - rendering it completely unsuable! I've unplugged it and let it sit in the sunshine to dry out, didn't help. Too bad. The concept is great, but the execution is flawed. - - - 4 weeks in and so far, so good! I was looking for something new and different and this Hamilton Beach fits the bill. I didn't want to get a standard maker with the same old glass/ceramic carafe motif with an heating element underneath - talk about ancient history! This looks good on the counter and does what it needs to - the end. Of course - the hot coffee stews in plastic until you drink it - hopefully that's okay! I am a refugee from the tyranny of Keurig. The Keurig could work well for low volume coffee drinkers who are single and just want a cup every now and then w/o having to brew an entire pot. The Keurig is also perfect for sampling different flavors, though all are weak. I have donated mine to the office."
"October 30, 2020",Kellie,1.0,,"The reason for my 1 star rating is the quality. The first one I bought only lasted a year, the coffee started leaking all over the counter. I loved it so much though I bought it again and this one only lasted 6 months, woke up to coffee all over our counter. We reached out to the manufacturer more than 7 days ago but have not heard back. I love the ease of this coffee maker and for the taste of the coffee, but the quality is TERRIBLE.  I need to add that my sister had the same coffee maker and the same issue happened to hers."
"January 14, 2014",kindred spirit,4.0,,"I make a large pot of coffee every morning and refill my cup several times as the morning goes on. One of the reasons I bought this coffee maker is that it uses a ""coffee tank"" with an internal warming plate and not a glass carafe that sits on a hot plate. The advantage: No longer do I have coffee with that burned taste, or worse, a baked on mess from leaving a glass carafe on the hot plate for too long. It's easy to use and has several brewing options as well as the ability to program it to brew at a set time. It's mostly plastic, but the stainless steel accents on the control panel add a little modern style to the unit. To serve a cup a coffee, you push your cup against a dispensing button. I have noticed that when I reach the bottom of the coffee tank, the dispenser drips and dribbles into the drip tray. At that point, it's cleaner to take out the tank and pour the remaining coffee from it before washing. After 30 brews, a message displays to remind you to do a cleaning cycle. I have found that reminder helpful because cleaning my coffee maker just doesn't make it on my calendar unless I get an external prompt to do it. And if you ignore the message, it disappears after a couple more brew cycles, but the quality of the coffee and the functionality of the machine both benefit from regular cleaning. Our current machine is the second Brewstation we've owned. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a coffee maker to last for a couple of years of daily use if it's maintained properly; but, the first Brewstation we had (same model) died about two months after the warrantee ended. The second purchase was made in May of 2013, so if it quits on me before or around the 1-year mark, I will update my review."
"July 20, 2019",marcy devaney,1.0,,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! **VERY ** DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING If you’re ok with getting up to ONLY FOUR cups of coffee for the price  of a 12 cup coffee maker , this HB model ( removeable side water tank) is for you. You’ll need to use almost TWICE as much coffee, water , electric ... & patience , as the average 12 cup coffee maker. Since this is obviously very odd ,  after alittle homework I discovered  the (documented)  fact that the MINIMUM LEGAL amount of coffee advertised as 12 cup  is 44-48 OUNCES... —THIS ONE & APPARENTLY THE VARIOUS HB MODELS LIKE IT , MAKES **AT MOST ** ONLY 32 OUNCES! —- Therefore the product advertising is not only VERY deceptive, but evidently also  illegal ! Ive spoken to Sr Management at the HB corporate location in Virginia about this. I pointedly asked them to change the deceptive marketing. I’m staying tuned to see if it actually happens . In the meanwhile , BUYER BEWARE  of HB products!"
"January 9, 2021",Diane Hickey,1.0,,"We had this coffee maker about a month, using it every day which doesn't seem like too much (our last carafe coffee maker lasted about ten years), when the button that your coffee mug pushed in to dispense the coffee got stuck, and hot coffee was spilling everywhere. (see picture) I couldn't put my hand in to unstick the button, because, well, hot coffee (right?).  I was out of the time that I could return it to Amazon, and my email/webform on the Hamilton Beach website have not been responded to yet (and I just checked again).  My husband has been using it since, but we have to have a knife out everytime we brew so we can 'unstick' the button after the coffee has been dispensed. My recommendation is NOT to buy this coffeemaker until they fix this design flaw. I am on Amazon today to order a different carafee-free coffeemaker from a different manufacturer."
"July 29, 2019",Joyce M.,3.0,,"Before going for it I wasted hours researching and this coffee maker seemed what I needed, but I was wrong. For small families it doesn't work very well, since you can't use the big water container for holding water to use through the week. You have to fill it up every time with the exact amount you'll drink. Besides that the cleaning is a pain in the ass. You have to remove the plastic parts (basket + coffee container) and hand cleaning it every day or your coffee will come with a bad and acid old coffee flavor. I wouldn't recommend this product"
"November 4, 2019",Gross Labs,5.0,,"We have been using this as our office coffee maker for the last month. So far so good! Our staff fluctuates from anywhere between 5-15 people per day. On a busy day, one full pot (water filled to the top, level 12) can serve about 6-7 cups of coffee. It's easy to program, and easy to dispense. Cleaning it can be a bit of a chore, and condensation can collect toward the back of the lid in the small groove that lines the ""bucket"" where coffee is held. We've been using a paper towel to wipe down the condensation at the end of each day so that bacteria doesn't grow. It's not tough, just a tad annoying to stay on top of that. All in all, we can recommend this product for anyone looking to get rid of their glass coffee pot, and/or reduce single use plastics when making coffee with the Keurig or Nespresso machines."
"February 27, 2016",Major Havoc,5.0,,"The mistake I made was not to look at the product dimensions, so I was surprised when this 9.2 x 12.5 x 16.8 inches bad boy would not fit underneath my kitchen cabinets. I live in an efficiency apartment building that was built in 1928, so that is why the cabinets set so close to the counter. So I had to put this coffee maker in my living area in an old entertainment center that I use for a bookshelf. I have seen some complaints about a plastic taste and smell, but I didn't have that problem because I use One Step Cleaner that is also available here at Amazon.. I brewed my first tank of coffee and have no complaints, I could even fill up my short squat travel coffee mug without any drips. Though if your coffee mug is six inches or taller, you'll probably have drips and/or not be able to fill your mug completely. One word of advice. If you have a Mr Coffee permanent filter, it is too tall for the filter basket. You'll have to purchase the Hamilton Beach version to get the right fit. I had no problem setting the clock, keep warm. and brew programming, but I am one of those guys that always had to set the time for my parent's VCR and microwave. My only complaint is that the light for the clock panel is a very bright blue light, so I'll probably have to find a way to cover it up when I pull out my Murphy bed in the evening."
"October 6, 2019",J S,2.0,,"During the first use I pushed the iced coffee button and it got stuck.  Through the Amazon return process they replaced it with a new one so very happy about that.  The new one came and it leaks every time.  I get a cup of coffee and it leaks all the rest of the coffee out, slowly, drop by drop.  Also, the warm button only keeps it warm, not hot.  When I get a cup later it is only a little above room temp.  I really wanted to like this pot because of the look of the side reservoir, the way it dispenses the coffee and the price.  I have been using it this entire time and just putting an extra cup under it to catch the rest of the coffee bc I keep hoping it will stop, but it doesn't.  I have now missed my window of return and I think I just felt like I should have returned it in the first place instead of doing the replacement route."
"March 30, 2019",Stewie,2.0,,I liked the serve feature but it is not practical for cleaning.  The design allows the grounds and coffee to overflow.  The lid which serves as the brew spout sets so love the coffee grounds float up and gets into the lid and brewing function holes.  See pics.  This may not happen if you do not make a 10 cup pot.  But who wants that feature.  It would not overflow so badly if I ground coffee myself on a very course grind.  But you can not use a store bought ground coffee.  It is more complicated to fill and clean than a coffee pot should be.  It does keep coffee hot.
"May 24, 2021",Dan M.,4.0,,We bought this to replace the other model without the side tank that went out. We liked the idea of the water being in a seperate compartment. After about the third use the lid on the water tank broke off but we just sit it on top now. Biggest complaints are this model slides across the counter top when you push to fill your cup. Our cabinets are not high enough to allow you to open the top to fill the coffee. We either have to hold onto the coffee maker to fill the cup or push it to the back wall to use. Overall a good coffee maker with some limitations.
"May 5, 2020",Okie24,1.0,,"This is the second BrewStation I have owned.  The first was absolutely perfect - no issues at all.  The gasket on the pour opening failed and I could not find a replacement part for purchase. I ended up buying the Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Coffee Maker, Programmable BrewStation Dispensing Coffee Machine (47900),Black - Removable Reservoir.  It is a mess!  Whoever redesigned the grounds basket needs to return to design school and pay attention to the form/function class.  The sleek look of the basket is cool, but the mess it makes is not.  The condensation water pools on the top of the basket as well as keeping the grounds soaked with water creating a runny mess when the basket is removed.  The previous model had less of a ledge and had sloped sides.  After brewing, the coffee grounds were easily removed and did not drip all over creation like this new version.  I wish I had not purchased this item.  A mess for the total price of around $60.  Don't buy it."
"May 3, 2020",JuSumGai,5.0,,"I have tried several coffee makers that, universally, disappointed me in the temp of the coffee. If you added cream, the coffee would be luke warm. This one keeps the coffee hot, it tastes great. It is easy to clean and fill. This my second one. The first one developed the problem people mention where the little wells fill and it leaked. I could see that the seal around the heating element had started leaking. I had scrubbed it particularly hard, trying to keep it thoroughly clean. I would recommend not being too aggressive, in that regard. You only really need to give it a good rinse between brews ."
"July 7, 2018",Linda S,1.0,One,just ok....because to dispense your coffee you push with cup on the lever and it moves the entire coffeemaker....so you have to hold on to coffeemaker and then press with cup to pour beverage.....I had Cuisinart for years but thought I would try this one.  Now a week or two later I am not happy at all.  The reservoir lid has a plastic hook  that broke off and unable to fix it with glue...it fell off again....The quality of the coffee is good but if you set it to keep warm it sounds like the coffee is actually boiling.  I would like to return or get replacement.  Since I wrote this review I have not heard from the seller.... Still waiting to hear from someone regarding a refund.....very cheaply made and it broke first time I opened the reservoir.  Will never buy from this seller again based on the fact they do not have the courtesy to follow  up.
"January 27, 2020",Michele,4.0,,"For the price I can not go wrong, I set it up the day before, I have one issue, the settings for the pot is full flavor  or # of cups when I do not use either I have to shut off and restart to use all the water since I use a full put daily.  Not really an issue to stop from purchasing this coffee pot but have to remember and the water level shows.  I am very please with my purchase"
"January 26, 2014",Dianne Averill,4.0,One,"So many considerations went into the decision to buy this coffee maker. We had finally become disgusted with our tenth keurig (they kept clogging up; we leased them from the coffee supplier and didn't have to pay, but still). We drink a lot of coffee-- five pots a day is average, so we needed a real workhorse. This was reasonably priced, and we liked the fact that it kept the coffee warm and dispensed a cup at a time. It's huge. The machine just fits under the upper cabinets, but then you have to pull it out to lift the lid to fill it. So it has to sit out at the edge of the counter. The container that holds the coffee can be used to fill with water to refill the machine. But it's big and awkward to fill in the sink and difficult to tip into the internal reservoir. We got a plastic pitcher. When you have finished brewing, the coffee stays inside the machine for dispensing. You can set the timer for two or four hours of warmth. Four hours gets burnt and even two isn't great. We use a thermos to store the coffee after it's brewed. Since the machine is on the edge of the counter, you can angle the thermos so it fills directly from the machine. You have to remember to turn off the coffee maker, since it does not recognize it is empty, and just stays on. Be careful when you lift the lid, as the steam from brewing causes water to condense on the inside. If you lift the lid too quickly, all that water pours down the back and onto the counter. Between that and the inevitable grounds and drips, it's a real mess. All things being equal, it's not terrible and we would buy it again. But make no mistake-- the coffee that comes out is not keurig quality or taste."
"May 30, 2021",Haley Hale,5.0,,Use about 5 times a day. Boyfriend is in love! So convenient and coffee is always just like fresh brewed! Love love love the being able to just fix a cup whenever. Dont have a pot and can use a cup.or yeti or whatever whenever! Perfect choice! We bought a reusable filter as well and will never use the paper ones again..but if you want to....it also fits those. It has a timer and is easy to use.
"January 19, 2014",Mike Vande Ven Jr.,2.0,One,"Bought this to replace a coffee maker that I hated. So this had to really shine, as I had a lot of negative things to overcome. This coffee maker has done it in style. It is designed very well. Some of the things I really like: * The level/button to press is far enough back that I have never spilled coffee during dispensing * There is a filter in the reservoir to prevent grounds from ever reaching your cup! * The water gentles spills onto the beans which means beans stay in the filter, and get extracted properly * There is an interior cup marker to make sure you pour in the correct amount of water * It's very easy to clean! A few things which could be improved further: * The beep when done could be louder/more (it's a single beep, I would like three beeps) * When using a gold filter, the top doesn't shut 100%. The coffee maker works fine, but it would be nice if it shut all the way. This is a wonderful coffee maker, especially at the price. Update: We have now replaced this. After a few months of use, it started to get inconsistent. Sommetimes we would have to run water through 3 times to get a full cup of coffee. Where was the water going? Steam. And then the water stopped making its way into the resivoir. That was the last straw. It had to be replaced."
"October 24, 2017",Billy,2.0,,"I bought this on a recommendation from my daughter; she has one of these coffee brewers.  I specifically asked if it burns the coffee because the coffee maker holds the coffee and gives you a easy pour dispensing on the front of the unit.  I guess my daughter does not recognize the difference. I will say nice things first. 1. It brews a good cup of coffee. 2. Dispensing the coffee is easy and convenient. 3. Reasonable price Not so nice. Brewing the coffee is a pain and the heating element burns the coffee. 1. You have to take out two baskets to pour in the water.  The one where you place the coffee filter and coffee grounds, the other is where the coffee maker brews the coffee to.  The bottom of the coffee maker is where you pour in the water and then re-insert the baskets. 2. Once brewed, the heat mechanism starts burning the coffee within 1/2 hour.  I am real picky about the flavor of my coffee.  Within a 1/2 hour the coffee is much hotter than originally brewed and begins to taste burnt.  After an hour, I am ready to throw it away.  After an 1 1/2 hours, it doesn't taste like the coffee that I brewed anymore.  So here is my solution.  I am taking the coffee grounds basket out using an OVE GLOVE so I don't get burned.  And again using the OVE GLOVE, I take the brewed coffee basket out and pour the coffee into a glass thermal carafe. 3.  Even for the price, this is a lot of trouble to go through. The heating element should be maintaining the temperature of the brewed coffee, not making it hotter to the point of scalding your mouth and it does not taste like the originally brewed coffee anymore. I guess this is a positive review for OVE GLOVE."
"September 29, 2019",David & Jennifer Vinson,1.0,,"Good idea but terrible design. The condensation from the lid goes down to the 2 sides where the coffee holder goes and after so much has built up, it slowly starts to leak out everywhere. THEN, the coffee maker dictates when I can make coffee. Out of the blue the clean word will pop up. Then when I hit the power button, the machine shuts off completely and wont come back on till at least 30 minutes. It does it at least 2 times a week. It did it yesterday and now after 36 hours, it still isnt turning back on. I recieved this machine on 7/26/19 & today is 9/29/19. Didnt even last 3 months. Spend you're money on something better. My coffee pot shouldn't tell me when I can or cant have coffee!"
"May 30, 2019",MOC29,5.0,,"It's a little hard to get used to not having a pot, but the dispenser is very convenient.  It's also easy to just fill the reservoir right at the sink. One minor issue we have is remembering to empty the area that holds the coffee. Habit is just to dump the filter and grinds,, but with this you also have to make sure the tank is empty and clean the heating plate. Even though the whole procedure is different than what you're used to in a coffee maker, I like it. The cold brew ice coffee is great ."
"December 30, 2018",mike wachs,1.0,One,"I have literally never written a review before, but I'm so disappointed in this product that it's time to start. Do not waste your money. We've had this coffee maker for a year and a half. It started acting poorly months ago. The coffee doesn't come out when you press the button. It dispenses all over the place, if at all, and you have to take the hot, giant brewing part off and pour it directly into your cup. It's designed poorly. The materials are flimsy. I have never hated a purchase so much. Just invested in a $29.99 Mr. Coffee from Costco. Looking forward to using it and throwing this in the trash where it belongs."
"June 14, 2016",Mary Linda,5.0,2,"I am really enjoying this coffee pot.  I had a single coffee maker in the Hamilton Beach, and the K one, but both quit working.  I am not sure how long this will last, but for now I love how I can dispense as much coffee as I like and it has no carafe to break.  I programmed it to stay hot 3 hours in case I forget to turn it off.  Also later in the day if there is still coffee left, I can use the dispenser button and fill an iced filled cup with the leftover coffee for iced coffee.  I never waste coffee now.  So easy to use and it looks nice as well.  Also BPA free."
"July 11, 2021",Paul J.,2.0,,"I am not going to lie this did work good up until 2 weeks ago. Purchased this item March of 2021 and by June 29, 2021 started having issues. I did read prior reviews for this same issue on older models and thought Hamilton would have resolved the problem on the newer model that I purchased but guess not. The issue is that under the urn fills with water/coffee and then leaks out all over your counter. Have not found the issue as to  where this is coming from but more than likely going to go buy a new coffee maker that is not manufactured by Hamilton Beach. Take my word for it, buy anything but this coffee maker or any coffee maker that this manufacturer makes. They may make other products great but not coffee makers."
"February 16, 2014",R. A.,4.0,One,"My 3rd Brewstation and all have been good coffee makers. Pluses: Better looking Easier to use and fill Better LCD display Variable remain on time Easier to clean Minuses: Clean coffee maker mode is erratic, sometimes after 1 pot, sometimes 10 Fill button recessed deeper, harder to see a full cup, esp. a dark colored cup but manageable Condensation runs down front on to Display and buttons. Time will tell if this is an problem. Removable drip tray fits VERY loose to pot and constantly comes off. Mine ""leaks"" somewhere. It is from the legs screwed on to the bottom of the main pot and a good amount of water drips off them when filling the supply well. Somewhere from a 1/8 to a 1/4 cup of cold water. The screws ""may"" have cracked the bottom of the pot. I don't know. It only leaks the fill water and not the Coffee. Maybe because hot coffee expands and closes it up. Its a minor irritation that I just deal with. I have read many reviews on the subject and it is NOT condensation but so far not a major problem, time will tell."
"December 31, 2020",Charlie,5.0,,Have not used it yet. We have an older Hamilton Beach similar to this and I think it is just about wore out.  I might add this is our 3rd one with the first being a lemon but Hamilton Beach backed their product so no complaints.  I did not take out the additional warranty assuming the coffee pot is in good shape.  I sure like the design of it and the fact I don’t have to wash the glass pot everyday.
"March 18, 2017",Amazon Customer,4.0,One,"This an excellent coffee maker for the price (I paid just over $30).  I have been using it for approximately one year, and it is still functioning as new.  I am very consistent with cleaning, and have not noticed any increase in brewing time or odd tastes in the coffee.  My one minor complaint about the design is the plastic reservoir from which the coffee is dispensed. Plastic (even food-grade like this one) is not the best choice and eventually absorbs the odours and tastes of the coffee.  I have noticed that because of this, the coffee goes stale much faster than when the machine was new (however, it's still superior to a glass carafe on a hot-plate).  I noticed that some reviewers complain about the dispenser nozzle spilling; I experienced this problem early on in my ownership of this machine and determined that it is caused by built up residue on the mesh inside the reservoir and the rubber seal outside.  Keeping it clean solves this completely. Now...how does the coffee taste? The answer: very good.  It's a relatively inexpensive machine, so I didn't expect spectacular results, but it exceeded my expectations.  I have used (unfortunately not owned) some very high-end drip machines and they out perform this one significantly.  Is it worth the price difference?...not for me.  When I want a superior cup I use a French press.  For the casual coffee drinker using average quality coffee this is a great unit.  Highly recommended."
"April 6, 2016",honesteeski,4.0,3,"Makes good coffee....does keep hot without burning...happily purchased on Amazon through Hamilton Beach ""re-certified"" program at considerable savings.... (refurbished) coffee maker arrived quickly and in great working order...(I've purchased several refurbished products from different manufacturers reasoning that refurb appliances are at least tested and work before they are shipped...so far no problems) Suggest watching the video or pay attention to the photos because this is a new way to brew and takes a little time to have it become routine.. Note: The unit is very tall and in order to fill with water, it must be slid out from under the counter... All in all no complaints from the coffee lovers in the family...and soon I'll get use to the new process and fill it without thinking..."
"August 31, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Well the coffee maker was interesting without the craft, I like it. it was different without spending a fortune on a bunn, But you always get what you pay for. started off really good then all heck hit the fan as the cleaning begaon, coffee would not brue, clean. slow stream ,clean. over heat,clean. use filtered water, clean. omg just it go's on and on. its really tough when you get up in the morning and want a cup, a bigger then normal cup of coffee and it has not passed the water through the filter to the coffee to even make a dribble of coffee that falls into your cup, very frustrating. i like the style of it but i think i will be going back to the same old coffee pot. sad......"
"October 15, 2020",Mrs. Georgette M.,5.0,,"This unit doesn't work correctly, it sputters and makes loud noises and sometimes I have to turn it off and back on to get it to finish the water in the reservoir, it just started doing this about a week ago and has been doing it every day now, our first unit that we bought from Walmart lasted us for years, this one sounds like it's going to blow up every day. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!"
"December 7, 2020",Jennifer Davies,5.0,,"I am so happy with this coffee maker! It brews the coffee nice and hot, giving it better flavor than my old glass pot style brewer. It really does stay hot for hours. My husband sleeps later than I do and can still get a hot cup that tasted great. It takes a little getting used to filling the reservoir without spilling any water. After a few days, I got it down and haven’t had any more problems. I definitely recommend this machine as the quality and price are quite good!"
"January 4, 2016",lawnmower man,4.0,One,"Not a bad coffee maker, but not the greatest either.  I studied at a LOT of different models and decided I wanted to try this ""dispenser"" type versus the old coffee pot style. Pros:  It brews well and keeps the coffee nice and hot.  It doesn't seem to scorch the last cup that sits for too long.  It's nice to just place my mug against the dispenser and have it filled without pulling out a pot every time.  No glass pot to break (I've done that more than once.)  It's a fairly sleek, modern-looking device - much nicer than the old style.  Programming the timer and other controls is very easy. Cons:  It makes a constant noise almost like the sound of low boiling water, so it's not quiet at all.  It's harder to wash the dispenser than a normal coffee pot.  Brewing is slower than other coffee makers I've been used, so if you're in a hurry, better hit a drive through. So far, we are happy with it overall, but the real test will be how long it lasts.  Our most recent Mr. Coffee lasted less than 6 months, then just died. We hope this one lasts a lot longer than that."
"January 9, 2015",V Weaver,1.0,62,And I'm getting it replaced.  Water gathers inside next to the Keep Warm Plate and according to Hamilton Beach there is no fix for this...I regularly have to soak up almost an inch of water from each side - who designs something like that and thinks it's a good idea?  I am in the warranty period so HB has been great about replacing it - but I would NOT buy this unit again.  One of the little pins that keeps the lid on the reservoir also popped off with no fix for that - so another reason not to like it.
"May 3, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,One,"Doesn’t make coffee very quickly but does a good job. Only problem is that the coffee doesn’t all come out of the spout. It will leak behind where you put the coffee cup. Not a lot, but enough to be annoying"
"October 31, 2013",Drew,4.0,2,"I like the carafeless (is that a word) coffee maker because my old carafe always dripped from the top when pouring and I always got some coffee on the counter no matter how carefully I poured.  This does the trick and I like the convenience of just pressing my cup against the bar and coffee flows out. Some other reviewers stated they had some water spillage when pouring fresh water into the housing. I haven't had that issue. Really, there are only two things that would make this a perfect coffee maker for me. If the base was weighted a bit more it wouldn't slide back so easily when you press your cup against the serving bar. I usually just hold onto the coffee maker with my other hand while I press the bar. The other thing that could improve is the warmer cavity. It keeps the coffee warm but not hot. I like a hot cup of coffee and it lacks in that department. Overall I do like the coffee maker but I usually end up microwaving the coffee to get that extra hotness."
"November 21, 2018",Trevor,2.0,,"I really wanted to like this coffee maker. We switched from a Ninja Coffee Bar  that we used for about 2 years (which I dropped and broke a piece that did not have a replacement part to). We decided to give this one a try because of the different design (no carafe) and lower cost than our previous coffee maker. After a couple months of use, here is my review: I was drawn to this coffee maker because it did not have a glass carafe  however, I feel that the part that holds the brewed coffee is a pain to clean after each use - it’s pretty big and bulky and just awkward to handle. We have felt since we first started using this coffee maker that the coffee taste terrible. I’m thinking it has to do with the keep warm setting and the plate that is in direct contact with the coffee. I was also disappointed with the quality of this coffee maker. Our first one leaked when we brewed the first pot and completely ruined it. Customer service was great - we returned that one and was fully refunded without any hassle. So we ordered a new one to give it another try. No leaking this time but the whole thing just feels cheap and flimsy. even the Hamilton Beach logo in the front has half smeared off from the heat/steam. With all that being said we will likely be switching back to a Ninja - which we loved. Totally worth the money!"
"December 22, 2015",J Edwards,5.0,2,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this machine! I have had a Keurig in the past, but dislike the lack of ability to choose the amount of coffee to add and the environmental impact of the ""K-cups."" I also have a  Bialetti  Stovetop Espresso Maker. However, if more than one person wants a cup of coffee and/or in succession, the Bialetti can't keep up. This Hamilton Beach machine is perfect for my family. I can make enough cups for me to drink as I'm getting ready in the morning, fill a tumbler for the car AND still have enough for my daughter. Three great selling points with this machine is that 1. there are two brew choices; bold or regular brew ( I prefer bold, as it brews a little more slowly) 2. it can be set to keep the coffee warm for up to four hours and 3. the best feature of all, there is no carafe, so the bitter burnt coffee taste is eliminated. Cons: the coffee basket and water reservoir are hand wash only."
"August 10, 2017",Kim,2.0,One,"Two stars instead of one because it DOES make coffee......we have had it for almost a year, so we really committed to giving it a chance.  In short:  water does not get hot enough for our taste; comes out in a tiny trickle-we have taken to dissassembling the thing to pour our coffee out of the internal coffee container.  The whole thing is so light that in order to press a mug against the dispenser trigger the whole thing needs to be braced against the wall.  It is a very tall and large coffee maker to begin with so that in order to open the top, it has to be moved to the front of the counter to clear the cabinets above. All this sliding the thing back and forth inevitably jostles and dislodges the little detachable overflow tray on the bottom, requiring you to wipe the sloshed contents off the counter at least twice during the morning routine. If you have a dark colored mug, you have to keep pausing on filling it (which takes a loooooong time- see above) because you can't see the coffee going into the mug.  These things individually probably sound petty on their own, but the whole experience is irritating and unnecessarily troublesome, especially as they all happen BEFORE your first cup of coffee.  We give up. Shopping for a new coffee maker."
"December 19, 2016",Juan Romero Jr.,5.0,One,"I've owned mine for a year now.  I've had 0 problems with it.  If you run vinegar through it every month or so, it'll stay clean and produce good coffee.  For a $35 coffee maker, this can't be beat.  I've chipped so many glass carafes, this is the biggest reason why I bought this model. I use a gold filter cup (reusable) and when I try to brew 8 or more cups at once, my grounds overflow out of the filter.  The gold filter is a little bit smaller than the actual filter cup, and I'm sure if I used a paper filter, I wouldn't have this problem.  Not so much a failure of the product as it is just a limitation of the filter itself. The real secret to great tasting coffee is 2 things, filtered water, and fresh grounds.  Obviously you want a maker that will heat the water up high enough, which this maker does.  Coffee should be smooth tasting (not bitter) and I grind my beans only at the time I'm going to brew them.  My coffee in this machine is never bitter.  My coffee has never tasted like burnt plastic either.  By the time you replace your carafe with your $10-20 coffee maker from Wal-Mart, you'd spent the money needed to buy this.  Safe yourself the trouble."
"July 26, 2016",See What I Saw Woodworking,2.0,One,"So, I was excited after reading a lot of great reviews, so I ordered it thinking I'd like the convenience of no pot, etc... So, first, the positives.  The coffee made is good.  It does a great job MAKING the coffee.  And I like that you can have it keep it hot for up to 4 hours.  That's way longer than usual, and when I'm working and get caught up in being busy, its nice to come back 3+ hours later and its still there, ready. The negatives. -  Even removing the drip tray at the front, its hard to fit a lot of the travel sized mugs under the dispenser.  Have to be awkwardly tipped to fill. -  Pouring water from the reservoir into the machine to fill it is SUPER annoying.  There is a wide heat element in the middle that if you happen to get water on, it will shoot out the front of the machine where the dispenser is.  Usually onto your shirt.  You effectively have a 1.5"" wide space to pour all the water in.  Just bad design -  Cleaning this is not fun.  I don't know why, but when you lift the top lid up to get the grounds container out, two things happen:  Water spills out from the connection where water goes into the lid, and coffee grounds are smeared all over the top and have to be wiped up, every time. -  When you lift the used coffee grounds out, it also drips everywhere.  I expect some water, but even 12 hours after its been off, there is just water in the container itself (not grounds) that have not drained. -  The dispenser regularly drips after you've filled your cup. So, basically, I'm going to keep it for a while longer to at least get my money's worth, but after a couple months of use, I'm really not a fan.  I'll be replacing soon."
"December 23, 2019",bigal,5.0,,"Great coffee, every time.  I've had this for 3 years, and it still works fine.  Most of these type coffee makers fail electronically in about 2 years.  Not this one.  Auto start is great.  When I wake up in the morning, my coffee is ready.  The mug dispenser feature is the best.  I clean it about once every couple of months, using white vinegar.  Just keeps going."
"August 18, 2020",Nicolette,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker. Having the water reservoir instead of having to fill a carafe and pour water into the make doesn't seem like a big deal, but it truly makes a world of difference. Only drawback so far is that it will slide on the counter. I just cut some Wenko foam non-slip shelf liner to fit beneath it, and problem solved.  The flavor of the coffee is excellent, and the temp is super hot! Keeps coffee hot without burning for 4 hours. I would recommend this product to anyone."
"June 29, 2020",Connie Leon,2.0,,"This is a nice coffee maker, easy to us BUT it has a design flaw that causes it to leak most of the times you fill your cup.  I was happy with our older Hamilton beach maker but had to replace it and chose this model because of the internal storage tank. After cleaning it I noticed that it leaked coffee when a cup was pushed against the pour bar and thought it was a defective model. I returned it in exchange for a new one with no hassle.  Unfortunately, the replacement machine had the same issue and leaks each time coffee is released from the storage tank. The cause has to do with the fill mechanism where coffee grows out from the tank. Unfortunately, I’m not a mechanical engineer and can’t properly describe or fix it. Has Hamilton Beach issued a fix for this problem?  If not, I’d like my money back."
"January 2, 2020",Deb M.,4.0,,"This coffeemaker is really tall!  It steamed up the kitchen cabinet, so it had to be pulled out at night to be ready for delay brew in the morning.  We tried moving it to the cooktop island, but you have to hold it when filling your cup because there are no rubber grips on bottom so it slides very easily.  It did make good coffee, although we never tried the iced coffee.  We returned."
"September 5, 2019",Kmacc07,1.0,,"I had this coffee maker 2 months before it slowly started making less and less coffee. I fill up the water reservoir with 12 cups and I'm lucky if it makes more than 2 cups with all the water still sitting in the reservoir. I have cleaned it, unplugged it and plugged it back thinking it wasn't getting the message that I wanted a full pot and every day it makes a little less coffee. I have emailed Hamilton Beach and still no response. No help from Amazon either."
"June 13, 2018",findagoodbuy,1.0,,"Update -- This was purchased less than 2 years ago.  It has sprung a major leak in the coffee tank and the coffee was all over the countertop.  Will not purchase another.  Had one of these before and love the convenience of just pushing the lever for hot coffee.  This one is just as nice, however, the 'keep hot' feature is very noisy and sounds as though it is still brewing.  Because of the noise, this product only got a four star as we feel it may have a much shorter life than the last Hamilton Beach Brew Station we purchased 6 years ago.  Was Easy to use and good coffee. --"
"November 4, 2019",Jessica Brower,1.0,,"I am very disappointed in this coffee maker, I'm sorry to say. As others have said, I have learned other Hamilton Beach coffee makers, and was extremely satisfied with them, but not this one. First of all, the coffee is barely past lukewarm temperature, and don't bother trying to take a cup before it's done brewing, because then it's not even close to lukewarm! Secondly, you have to hold the unit when dispersing for coffee or it will slide. Also, it's takes a long time to brew and you have to pretty much guess when it's done. The ice coffee option is ok I guess, but that also takes a long time. I haven't had this 2 months and I'm already looking to buy another coffee pot, when I usually keep coffee pots for atleast 1 to 2 years! This needs a lot of work."
"October 22, 2019",Xavie,5.0,,"Lol the people writing bad reviews complain about literally any and everything. I've had this coffee machine for over a year now and it's worth it. If the machine pushes back when you use your mug to get the coffee out ...idk maybe rest it against a wall??? This model does not let water get into the bottom, and if any water does get in the bottom its probably from the lid because of the condensation. Obviously if you leave the moisture on the bottom where it's not supposed to be it will grow a little mold. CLEAN YOUR COFFEE MAKER. Stop complaining like something is wrong with the product."
"May 11, 2016",L. B. Clark,1.0,,"REVISED: from 5 to 1 star! just over 1 year from buying this, it simply quit: lights are on but ""nobody home"" --- does not make coffee or even keep it warm any more. too bad. going back to analog: French press Leaving original review too: this is the 3rd or 4th one of these we bought (going back to 2003). we ""sold"" our sister-in-law after she stayed here. eventually the valve gets stuck, or some other problem occurs (after daily use), but NOT so as to think ""wow that didn't last long"". [NOTE BENE: We have changed our mind. this last one elicited exactly that response: ""WOW that didn't last long""] it keeps the coffee at the perfect temp without burning it. so convenient. and, best of all: it makes a GREAT cup of joe! this model has some improvements such as a variable time to stay on and a side water reservoir which are genuine improvements"
"August 15, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is our second Hamilton Beach coffee maker of this style. I thought our other one was broken as the heating element was just clicking but it just needed a good cleaning (oops!). So we have an extra coffee maker now. Our current Hamilton Beach coffee maker is used at least daily and during the winter months twice daily. I like that the water reservoir can be removed as it's a challenge for me (I am short) to reach up and over standard coffee makers to add water. Pre-programming is easy and the heating length up to four hours is handy. I have never had burned coffee from this coffeemaker. We use the bold brew option and start the day with a nice cup of ☕
"May 31, 2019",JJM Jr,2.0,,"This is the second model Brewmaster I've owned, and I love the design.  But as others have reported, the warming cycle seems to maintain a ""brewing"", not ""keep warm"" temperature.  The coffee isn't quite boiling, but you can hear it ""hissing"", and if you don't pour the coffee shortly after brewing, I think it tastes burnt. This is actually my second unit.  I returned the first, and for the first week, the replacement was fine.  It brewed as usual, and then kept the coffee warm, without making noises. After a week, the replacement stopped kicking down into a warm cycle.  I measured the temperature after an hour, and you can see the temp of the heating element is 307.9 (recall water boils at 212). There are so many positive reviews, I'll try again, and will update my review assuming I get a ""good one""."
"March 7, 2021",F. Mondésir,4.0,,"I bought this to replace my very old Hamilton Beach Brewstation, ordered the exact same model as my old brewstation and when on the first use it was leaking, i reached out out to the seller and offered a refund or a new machine, i opted for a new coffee machine... they replaced it at no cost. The replacement is very slowly leaking (when pouring coffee) but overall works fine, so I'm sticking to it"
"February 22, 2013",Nohohos,5.0,,"When the old machine finally quit on us, I went in search of one that wouldn't require a semi-annual carafe replacement. We went through at least four or five glass carafes at $12/each. So I looked into the thermal carafes and stumbled upon this little gem. There are a lot of reviews about spillage and condensation, etc. But let me tell you, it works like a dream for us. No carafe at all. Awesome. I'll take cleaning out the storage tank over a carafe any day of the week. We haven't had so much as a stray drip in the drip tray. The coffee tastes just great to me using the bold setting, and the temperature is also right. Our ""Keep Warm"" setting is 3 hours, but it's nice to have different options there. The programming works fine. The instructions are easy to understand. I have filled a standard-sized travel mug and virtually all our regular mugs. I could see the dispensing spout may be an issue if you use handmade pottery mugs with irregular shapes. But even with those, I bet if you applied a little common sense, you'd be kicking yourself for not having picked this up sooner. Obviously, I cannot comment on longevity yet, but I'll update. ***UPDATE, August 25, 2014 We've had the coffee maker for about a year and a half now. I love it just as much. It's easy to use, easy to clean, still doesn't drip randomly. I would recommend it! ***Another UPDATE, February 8, 2015 Still going strong. I have been using a Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter in this machine since the beginning. While the fit isn't absolutely perfect (the filter is just a centimeter or two too tall), it doesn't affect the result at all. **UPDATE March 29, 2018 - Finally had to retire our BrewStation after roughly 5 years. The internal gasket at the dispenser must've degraded to the point that it no longer sealed in the coffee. After a few days of discovering a full drip tray and multiple attempts to clean and correct the issue, we resorted to picking up another machine. Would probably be nice to have the ability to replace just the tank. The new machine is good. The new tank does seem to wobble a bit more than the old one did when it's in place, but we haven't noticed any leakage. The coffee dispenses quickly and seems hotter than our old machine."
"February 18, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"We had the previous model and loved it. Like the improvements on this model, so we upgraded. There is a problem: the coffee dispense button leaks. Contacted HamiltonBeach,  and hopefully this is a one off. Edit: Nope seems to be a design defect. HB sent us a new machine, same problem. Still use it, but have to wipe the counter after every use. Shame, really liked the idea of it..."
"December 7, 2019",Donna C. Parlaman,5.0,,"I am not sure why this coffee maker got any poor reviews.  I had an earlier version of this for about 15 years before it finally wore out.  I ordered a new one and I love it.  It is so much easier to fill (no pouring water into a chamber); easy to set the controls to what you want; I can only guess that anyone not happy with this machine either did not follow the instructions or  actually got a defective machine, which happens occasionally in life.  I would not hesitate to order this machine again for myself or as a gift.  It is attractive on my counter and makes great coffee (even iced coffee).  I gave it 5 stars because I think it deserves 5 stars."
"March 24, 2018",Tom from Kent,5.0,,Really like the coffee maker.  Keeps coffee hot. Easy to fill and easy to clean. But if you are looking for a fast coffee maker this one takes about 15 - 20 minutes for a full pot. The very fist Hamilton Beach coffee maker seemed quicker. We usually set the timer so coffee is ready when we get up. On this unit you can either remover the water tank to fill it or just open the lid and pour in water or as if you have a sink faucet where the head can be pulled out and pull it to the coffee make. ( If it’s close enough )
"June 2, 2016",Bad Dolphin,5.0,,"We prefer to grind our own coffee, but our Cuisinart has failed on us several times. Cuisinart has been absolutely fantastic about replacing it, but what do you do for coffee while you're waiting for it to arrive? After much reading of reviews, we decided to try this as a temporary solution--and just love it. It's easy to use, and makes coffee strong the way we like it. The review about having to be careful when dispensing coffee where very helpful. Pre-alerted, we had no problem at all with this feature. So I would advise paying attention, but don't let it be the reason that you don't order this excellent machine. We are using our third replacement Cuisinart now, but this guy's stored carefully in the closet for the next round!"
"September 18, 2015",Libby,5.0,,"I purchased this, despite the bad reviews, because I have been wanting a programmable coffee maker and I cannot stand burnt coffee, ,so the carafeless design appealed to me.  I did not find this to be ""too big"" as a lot of the negative reviews have said.  I have it on my counter under the cabinet where I keep my coffee mugs, and it fits nicely.  The cord is sufficient length (I actually had to wrap it and zip tie it because it was longer than I needed)  I have it set on the BOLD setting and with a full pot it does take about 18 minutes to brew.  However, I have it on a timer and usually only make 8 cups, so that really doesn't bother me.  My coffee has not come out tasting burnt at all ( I'm super crazy about that.  Nothing is as gross as burnt coffee)  I don't understand how people are spilling or dripping when dispensing the coffee.  It's pretty straightforward and I haven't had any problems with it.  The condensation in the coffee maker after it's done brewing is quite a bit, but I just open the top and let it air dry while I'm at work.  Again, I don't see a problem with that.  I am so happy I ignored the negative reviews and purchased this."
"November 3, 2013",Bill,3.0,One,Filling the reservoir directly from the kitchen sink is the only way to go but lefties may find removing and replacing it a bit awkward. The controls are clear and easy to use. While pressing your mug against the dispenser bar it is easy to push the coffee maker backwards.  Be careful where you put your other hand if you try to hold it in place. It's not too hard to get used to the low rumbling sound it makes while there is still coffee in the chamber. You may disagree but I miss the beep saying the coffee is ready as I'm reading the morning paper at the time. The flavor of the coffee is acceptable but nothing to write home about.  The BOLD setting made no significance difference. I should have paid more attention to the many comments saying the coffee isn't hot enough.  They were right on the money.  The coffee rapidly reaches a drinkable temperature and I find myself drinking it quickly so it doesn't get too cool instead of reading the sports pages. Update:  Make sure the reservoir is properly seated.  Nothing will happen if it isn't. Second Update The Brewstation is history.  It is being replaced by a Cuisinart DCC-3000.  I tried to get used to lukewarm coffee but couldn't do it.  That's too bad.  It is perfect except for its thermometer.
"November 22, 2020",Charles J Lynn,2.0,One,"Leaks coffee down the front when you get some out. The drip tray catches most but not all, there's always some under the maker. Water condensation runs down the back when you open the top to refill it. Coffee gets warm but not as hot as most makers."
"January 30, 2014",canoe stripper,4.0,,"I have only made a few batches of coffe with it so far.  At first using the brass basket I was NOT inpressed.  The basket lets the water go through too fast.  There were grounds that were not even wet.  So I used a paper filter and the worked much better.  I was making only 4 cups.  As far as some of the other issues people have brought up I dont seem to have.  The cord thing is OK with me, I have an outlet near by and would not like to have a lot of cord to deal with.  The filling the cup deal is OK to, not sure what the fuss is about there either.  One thing I was somwhat disappointed in and why I gave it a 4 star is the bottom of the holding tank is pretty much flat.  I feel that it should at least have a gentle slope to the drain so that you get all the coffee out.  But that seems to work OK too. I changed from the melita funnel and carafe to this only to make things simpler and I melted the funnel on the stove.  I dont like having a lot of equipment on hand that takes up space so will se how this works. Well I have had it for a while and made quite a few batches of coffee.  It does a good job making the coffee using the paper filters.  It does not take a lot of coffee to get the taste I want.  The bunn is a coffee hog that way.  The one thing that I deal with is that the coffee temp is cooler than I like.  I like hot coffee, this unit is at drinking temp right away.  But all in all it does a good job. The complaints in the other reviews seem to be from those that have to be able to push a button and all to work perfectly.  unfortunately it is not like that in the real world."
"July 12, 2017",PinkyFloyd,5.0,One,"I think that all coffee makers should be modeled after this one.  After my percolator coffee pot died after only a year, I wanted something that didn't look like the standard coffee maker. I purchased this coffee maker about 7 months ago because I loved the idea of no carafe to wash and no disgusting, rusted burner under the carafe.  Everything is contained inside and is easy to take apart and clean.  No broken carafes - ever.  The option to make a bold pot of coffee or regular is a nice feature and there is a distinct difference between them.  The timer is nice so you can wake up to the smell of coffee (ahhhhh) and you can program how long you want the coffee to remain heated and hot up to 4 hours.  All in all this is a really nice coffee maker."
"February 9, 2020",Smokin Gun Labradors Kenosha WI,1.0,,"I have been chatting with Amazon CS for the past hour. 4 different reps and still no result. I am going to share on here now. Had the pot since Wednesday and when I push to start the coffee it goes to Ice Coffee, I push the button many many times until it finally goes to coffee. Today I tried to turn off the pot because it was empty. It would not allow me to shut it off. Beyond frustrated at this point."
"February 7, 2016",prettypixels,2.0,,"So disappointed in this product!  So many positive reviews, but I have seen a few others echoing my experience so I don't think I'm alone.  The coffee when it is first made is just lukewarm, and bitter.  It doesn't heat properly until it's been on and brewed for about an hour, and who has that kind of time?  The idea is that the coffee is delicious and hot right away and stays that way.  If you don't have enough coffee in the carafe and leave it on (less than six cups), it will scorch the heating element inside.  Making a fresh pot is difficult when it's been on as everything inside, including the piece you remove to fill with water, is insanely hot and steamy and hot water everywhere.  I could probably work around the other issues IF the coffee when first brewed was fresh, hot, and delicious.  Sadly it is lukewarm and bitter.  So we will look for a better option."
"March 23, 2021",Max,3.0,,"This is my fifth Hamilton Beach coffee machine, over a period of many years and two homes. The last two have leaked from the bottom. Amazon was great in facilitating the return of the first leaker but the second one has leaked coffee too. We have kept it but put a paper towel under it every day. All that said, it makes good coffee and is easy to use."
"March 25, 2017",Flying Lady 76,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  This is the 3rd one we have owned.  The 2 previous versions lasted a combination of 12 years.  The new one has some convenient improvements.  1.  The water tank is removable.  2.  It is a bit lighter weight and in this case it is a good thing.  3.  It is much easier to clean and that is an important feature for me.  The past 2 versions were a bit more laborious to do a complete cleaning. Aesthetically it is beautiful.  And I guess the last version was ready to give up the ghost, because the coffee in this unit tastes much stronger and smells amazing.  I always use filtered water and I think that is why we have had such great luck with all of our Hamilton Beach coffee makers.  I absolutely love the No Carafe style."
"April 29, 2020",AHH,3.0,,"This is my third HB BrewStation.  I bought my first one in 2006 (I think). I like the dispensing rather than a carafe. I replaced the first because it was old and starting to leak back in 2011 or 12.  I just bought this one since the electronics in the other stopped working.  The LED would light up, but the buttons stop responding. I can't give this one 5 stars.  When keeping the coffee warm, it's distractingly LOUD.  Loud enough that I may have to look into a different Coffee maker."
"December 11, 2019",Steel Town,1.0,,"I regret purchasing this. It has a unique concept and it works in a way, it'll brew your coffee. But man, is it messy. This thing is a giant water leaker. It gets dirty way too fast, the parts are hard to clean. The part that it wants you to fill water with to place into the machine is always leaking water out. Apparently there's a beep when it's done? I've never heard it. It's just a messy device overall. I got this to replace a very old Mr. Coffee machine which was fluid to use and not have leaks and mess everywhere. This contraption is not worth the price for me and will be eventually looking to find a way to replace it."
"January 29, 2021",Alexis Hanson,2.0,One,"I like the dispenser and that's the primary reason I chose this. True to all other reviews, the unit slides across the counter when pressing cup in for a fill. Also, over time, extreme leaking from the metal plate within the reservoir. As of the day I'm writing this, there's permanent damage to my countertop where the pot leaked enough coffee through this loosened plate to bow the laminate. Guess I'm switching back to a carafe coffee brewer. Dispenser feature isn't worth the cost of replacing countertops."
"March 22, 2016",AZ and AZ,4.0,,"I love the idea of this coffee maker. My husband and I frequently make a full pot of coffee in the morning and sip all day on it, so I thought this would be perfect - no more leaving a carafe on the burner, no more burnt coffee. In practice, there are a few things that could be changed. Putting the water in/dumping the old coffee out is a bit of a pain but you get used to it. But the most annoying thing is that the keep-warm timer only goes up to 4 hours, and you can't turn the coffee maker back on to warm - you have to brew a whole new pot. The quality seems good and it brews a nice, hot cup of coffee (but I'm not a coffee snob!). Hamilton Beach in general seems to make quality products for a good price and this is my 2nd small appliance by them."
"November 23, 2018",joel cortez,1.0,2,Coffeemaker worked fine for about 3 months and then nothing.  The warranty people are very not concern that i need my coffee every morning and so far i have not gotten my replacement after 17 days of reporting and paying shipping cost of 11.49 and submitting all required documents.  What a ripe off!  I know things break but they could have have send me another one by now... Still struggling.
"November 24, 2018",Cindy Hall,5.0,,"This is one of the best coffee makers I haved owned. This 12 cup programmable java machine brews into an internal storage container and, with the push of your coffee cup next to the drip mechanism, one hot and delicious cup at a time awaits. No water dripping all over your counter as you pour water into the tank.  No worries about breaking the carafe because there isn’t one!  This Hamilton Beach Brewstation keeps your coffee hot for up to four hours, but mine doesn’t last that long, as it tastes so good.  It is sturdy yet lightweight, and it is easy to clean. This is a very fun and affordable addition to your home brewstation."
"May 2, 2016",Georgia L,5.0,,"Love it, we haven't had any problems. I tried a cup after 2.5 hours of letting the brewed pot sit, I was very curious about the anti-scorch feature and it did not disappoint! So handy this is exactly what we need in our household. We were the people that would brew a lot and sip on it all day, having to turn it off after brewing to prevent scorch and microwave cups throughout the day. Not anymore! After a week’s worth of daily use, and the coffee maker is still working great. The small round bottom filter is difficult to clean, typically I rinse it out after use. But after a week that filter is starting to stain, so I’ll likely run Vinegar through it to cleanse it all. Overall this has been a great addition to our home. A Little tip, just run hot water through it and the kids can make hot cocoa and feel like Mommy and Daddy!"
"June 21, 2016",Mimi,2.0,2,"When you make 12 cups of coffee, water leaks out the overflow hole in the back.  We worked around this by making 11. We bought it in January of 2014.  As of April of 2016, so slightly over 2 years, every time we push a cup against the button to dispense, coffee runs down the front of the machine, all over where it is silver on the front starting from ABOVE the button.  We clean it on a regular basis and it is not like it gets ""overworked"", meaning, we don't ever make multiple pots and sometimes we only make 4 or 6 cups when there will only be one of us drinking coffee that day.  Hamilton Beach said that we need to replace the coffee tank.  A new coffee tank costs $16.99.  For a machine that we paid $39.88 for, why not just buy a new one?  None of the electrical parts are in the brew tank, and it only had a 1-year warranty, so where is my motivation to replace the tank?  Do coffee makers that don't get abused REALLY only last 2 years????"
"April 18, 2019",A. Kisner,1.0,One,"This is a horrible product. It burns and evaporates the coffee if you make more than one cup. It takes 6 cups of water to make 4 cups of coffee and it must be used right away or it continues to burn. Your second cup, 30 minutes later will be half a cup of burned coffee. This junk went in the trash after about a dozen uses. More garbage sold by Asia-zon."
"May 15, 2021",CDC,1.0,,"I have purchased this item many times over (10+) over the years.  I loved it.  I always keep a spare in the basement.  I recently pulled out my spare and unfortunately it leaks from the bottom of the unit and there is no way to dispense coffee without making a big mess.  I purchased another and the same thing happened.  I did return that one since it was a recent purchase and I bought another which also leaks.  For whatever reason, this company has had ample time to work out the issues.  They have gone from great...to do not buy."
"July 17, 2019",joe,5.0,,I like the ease of use with the warmer feature keeping the coffee warm for hours without burning. I read some of the reviews before buying but I rented a condo and that was the maker they had so with the experience of using it and mostly positive reviews I decided to buy. I haven't been disappointed. The only criticism I have that if make a full 12 cups you have to put only 12 cups of water it will over flow. I liked to add extra water to compensate for the filter and grinds I can't with this. Overall it's a good buy and I would buy another.
"June 3, 2021",SG,5.0,,"Went shopping for a Hamilton Beach coffee maker similar to what I had. None anywhere where the water is stored in the machine. So I found one on Amazon and it’s compact, doesn’t take up much counter space, and can keep coffee hot for up to 4 hours! Great coffee flavor and easy to clean and wash up. Plus, less expensive than any on the market! We love it!!!"
"October 9, 2018",MT Legend,1.0,,"We have had the product for about 5 months and have experienced leaking issues.  If we fill the water tank with water and leave it on the brewer overnight for a timed brew in the morning there is usually some standing water on the counter near the unit.  If the water tank is filled and left sitting by itself, there appears to be no leaking. The spigot where the brewed coffee is dispensed leaks a few drops at a time.  We have to keep a large empty cup under the spigot at all times to catch the coffee drips so it does not overflow the small catch tray.  I cleaned the area heavily with vinegar and it did not help.  If you had a full pot of brewed coffee sitting in the unit and went away for a few days you might come home to 12 cups of coffee spilled out on your countertop. The unit is easy to use and brews a good cup of coffee, but the leaking is unacceptable."
"December 29, 2020",Jessie,3.0,,"I purchased this coffee maker to replace an older model HB BrewStation that finally gave out. It is a disappointment over my old one. It leaks behind the cup when trying to dispense the coffee. I’ve tried to hold the cup to prevent leakage with minimal success. Also, on my old model, the whole spill proof tray could be removed and washed. On this model I can only remove the medal grid to wash. I have to use a paper towel to soak up the drippings. I guess I’ll keep it but I wouldn’t purchase this model again."
"September 14, 2020",billinwv,2.0,,"Brews good, flavor is good but it makes a mess every time it is used. You have to get the cup exactly right, or it dribbles down the front, collects under neath and its just messy. One can be really careful when filling the cup but it still dribbles. Would not buy it again.  Update - the dribbles end up on the counter, NOT in the drip pan. Update - see attached photo of typical mess after each use."
"March 26, 2019",Katrina Santos,5.0,,"I started dating someone who had this coffee maker, and just needed to have one for my place. As someone who loves coffee, works with coffee, and used a french press for years, I can safely say that this coffee maker - even though the taste is not as smooth as a french press (obviously), is one of the best coffee makers I've ever used. I drink around 4 cups of coffee in the morning, so to have hot coffee anytime I want it without it burning is definitely a plus. I also just love how coffee dispenses like a fountain drink, making it super easy and quick to put into a thermos. Highly recommend this product especially for the price."
"April 1, 2020",RL,1.0,,"This was purchased as a replacement.  My wife loves the dispenser.  However, the seal on the dispenser tends to start leaking after about 1 year.  Cleaning the unit with vinegar or coffee maker cleaner does not help.  So this is becoming a bit of a nuisance.  The next time the thing starts leaking badly, we will probably buy some other model."
"July 7, 2019",scremer1,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot because there is no glass to work with. It would never fail, we would drop or run into the counter with our glass coffee pots breaking the glass. Here you just hold your mug up to the pot and it dispenses the coffee. At the very end of the pot, I tip it a little to get every last drop of coffee but this machine does good emptying nearly all of the contents without tipping it. I hope they always make this!!!"
"September 3, 2018",Jan,4.0,,"This is the third Hamilton Beach no carafe coffee pot I've owned.  I like the coffee it makes and love the dispenser.  Older model had a coffee grain filter you could remove and replace that is now a permanent screen, I have no issues with this.  Older model had a fixed drip tray, new one is removable and a breeze to clean.  The machine will keep coffee hot for 4 hrs, it sometimes gets too hot but you can live with it.  I always brew on “bold” setting much better flavor. Over last 15 years it is a good machine for the price. We brew 365 days and it does the job."
"April 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,My only complaint is that it sounds like either it tries to continue to brew once all the water is gone grom the fill side OR the coffee is trying to boil inside the coffee side. It makes a continuous gurgling noise once the coffee has brewed. Very annoying and I'm thinking not good for longevity of coffeemaker. I have started turning it off when coffee is done and reheating coffee in microwave.
"June 30, 2021",Nancy,1.0,,"When you insert your coffee mug to get coffee, pressing against the lever causes the whole unit to move.  You have to hold the unit with your hand at the top to stop it from sliding across the counter.  Putting you hand on the top to stop it from moving,  I found not doable as the top of the unit gets hot when in operation.  Poor design :(  I went back to my cusinart.  Much better coffee maker.  I would not recommend buying this at all."
"January 17, 2016",Mateo,4.0,One,"I am absolutely obsessed with Iced Coffee.  I can't get enough of it, so when my co-worker told me about an iced coffee maker I had to jump on Amazon and research and utimately purhcase.  The Hamilton Beach 47000 series is awesome!  I can make iced coffee that tastes just as good as Dunkin Donuts for a fraction of the cost and no driving.  I've made hot coffee a few times out of this unit as well and it definitely tasted better than the traditional pot that burns as it stays warm.  The only reason I can't give it 5/5 stars is that the water tank is awkwardly tilting to the side.  I thought this was a manufacturer defect, but apparently this is how it is supposed to be.. awkward.  Anytime I show off my new toy seems like every person wants to try and even it out properly.  Not that this is that big of a deal as I don't leave it out on the counter.  Overall, very satisfied!"
"October 19, 2015",Theresa R.,5.0,,"This coffee machine is wonderful.  I cleaned the appropriate parts in warm soapy water, and the very first pot tasted great.  2 tablespoons of coffee per cup is printed on the machine and the instructions say 1 per cup.  I'm using 6 level tablespoons for 12 cups of coffee.  It comes out perfectly on the regular setting and slightly stronger on the bold setting.  I like strong coffee.  I don't use the warming feature, but from the appearance, it's probably safe.  No glass pot to break, no canister to clean.  I use distilled water, so there's no build up to clog the machine and the coffee tastes much better.  I don't understand the poor reviews, except for the fact they recommend way too much grounds. I had a Mr. Coffee 10 cup with stainless steel canister for 12 years--never cleaned it because I used distilled water.  This machine makes better coffee IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.  You can go to the manufacture web site to get detailed instructions.  Don't miss out on this great buy, especially if you like it simple and efficient at a great price!"
"May 28, 2017",Brooks,5.0,One,"This has been one of the best coffee pots that I have ever used.  The urn style pot is amazing and keeps coffee hot for 4 hours.  The flavor is so great with this brewstation as well.  You can adjust it to your preference as you like.  The time delayed start is awesome for working days.  Set it that night and BOOM fresh coffee for the morning, no hassles.  If you have never had coffee from an urn style pot then you are truly missing out.  Don't hesitate, BUY this now!!  You will not regret it whatsoever...."
"May 22, 2014",Bluegrass Gazer,5.0,,"I've had this coffee maker for a week, and I'm really glad I purchased it. The look is sleek - slightly bigger than a ""normal"" coffee maker with a carafe. The design is well though-out.  Remove the reservoir, fill it with water, and pour it into the coffee maker.  The same reservoir fills back up with coffee. This unit does a great job of keeping the coffee hot, and I really like the fact that I can select how long the coffee will stay hot before it automatically shuts off, like more expensive coffee makers. Even though it is make of a lot of plastic, it does not feel cheap.  All parts fit together very well. It appears that critical parts within the unit can easily be replaced, as they are installed with normal screws (the perk valve, heating element, front panel.) I have not experienced any leaking. The only ""complaints"" I have are ones other reviewers have mentioned:  I need to hold the coffee maker with one hand while I dispense coffee into my mug with another.  Also,the front panel is really bright.  I guess that's okay for a night light, but man it's bright! I would highly recommend this coffee maker to anybody."
"May 12, 2020",Anna Farrell,1.0,,"I am incredibly disappointed with this coffee maker. I love the concept however, the first one I received I had to send back because the water chamber was leaking out of the bottom when I went to fill it. So amazon sent me a new one. 2 months later, I have a letter out to the company. It does not brew all the water in the chamber. It always leaves 2-4 cups of water in the chamber, in order to get it to brew it all I have to turn it off and back on. The coffee does not have a smooth coffee taste, no matter what brand coffee I use. And like many others it slides across my granite coffee top, so I have to hold the back of it in order to dispense the coffee. Again love the concept but I’ve had 2 of these coffee makers since February, and it is now May and I am looking for other products. Save your money or spend it elsewhere."
"July 19, 2014",T.T,5.0,,"I upgraded my old Hamilton Beach BrewStation with this one. The method of putting water in the system for coffee brewing was a pain for me because I had to completely slide the unit out from underneath my cabinets to fill it and then I had a mess to clean up with water on my counter. My old coffee maker would show that it needed cleaning even after doing a cleaning of the minerals in the boiling tank. This one has a lift out and fill water reservoir, like a Keurig. I like that most of all and it was the primary reason I bought this one.  I've had several that did this. I like the convenience of just putting my coffee mug to get coffee. I don't have to lift a carafe. This one has a few more buttons to work with. I can program how many hours I want my coffee to stay hot. It also has an Iced Coffee button which I haven't used but the recipe for the recipe looks good. It has brew options also. I use regular brew and you can also set it for just making 1-4 cups of coffee. The left side of the coffee reservoir has a small window to view the coffee level. You can still program this one to start brewing at a certain time. You can also order a water filter for the water reservoir. It seems to take less time to brew the same amount of coffee as my old BrewStation. I like being able to wash the water reservoir. A big plus for this unit. If you like Hamilton Beach BrewStations try this one. I'm really pleased with it."
"May 13, 2021",Judy M.,5.0,,"My husband is a coffee fanatic  and this fit in nicely in our coffee bar. This is our second one, the 1st one still worked but it was slowing down, after having it for over 5 years, not because of the quality but because of the water that he was using( city water, water build up). With his second one he is using distilled water. Way worth the money."
"January 14, 2014",Clyde & Shauna,5.0,,"We were draw to the carafe-less style and the detachable (and easily fillable) water reservoir, and both have worked exactly as advertised.  We love the convenience this provides. I'm a big ice coffee drinker and this works really well for that.  Put ice in coffee tank, and put a little water (never over 6 cups) in the water reservoir, add coffee to the strength you prefer, press ice coffee setting and turn it on.  It brews the coffee directly over the ice in the tank, and the insulated tank keeps it nice and cold for most of the morning.  I don't like really strong coffee, so I normally put ice up to the 10 cup line, water up to the 4 cup line, and 6 scoops of coffee in the basket, and that seems to work pretty good for me. We got the ultra with the chrome accents and that looks pretty sharp, with decent quality materials.  Our old coffee maker collected water on the lid and would dump it down the back of the coffee maker when we opened the lid, this one has a catch lip along the back that directs the water back into the tank which is much cleaner.  We have had no trouble at all getting the coffee to dispense properly, as others had noted, so either they improved this on the ultra or it just fits the way we hold our mugs/cups  (both large and small containers).  Opening is wide enough to accept, both my larger ice coffee insulated cups, as well as travel mugs. Things I would like to see on this unit (although it's very good as is)....  I would like to see a float shut-off/turn down for the heater, as when the coffee gets low in the tank it starts to burn a bit.  I would also like to see the level indicator for the coffee tank be more up front like the water indicator is, or at least more convex so it's easier to see.  Finally the last nice to have would be a small  light that comes one when the dispensing button is pressed."
"July 12, 2020",yvonne.freeman,4.0,,"We like this coffee maker enough to have bought this second one. The first one leaked a lot and did not clean up well with vinegar and water clean up. We like the way the coffee maker works, Hard to clean filter well though we now rinse after each use. This one leaks when serving especially towards the end. Probably would buy again as price and type is something we like."
"August 19, 2020",Diana,5.0,,"I have purchased the Hamilton Beach coffee maker like this (of course they have updated over the years) for over 20 years and I still love it! Biggest reason? No carafe! I use to break those all the time! Super clean dispensing right into your cup, no spills or splashing. Keeps coffee hot up to 4 hours or less if you want and has an auto shut off. Also has a timer if you want to pre-prep to auto start for next morning. I also highly recommend cleaning the unit at least once a month with a solution ran through it to remove any mineral build up from water. Will be super disappointed if they ever stop making this kind."
"August 6, 2019",Dkgoodman,1.0,,"I was hoping to get rid of the carafe.  Unfortunately, the coffee still comes in contact with a metal plate inside where the brewed coffee is stored; that last cup is very burnt.  At least with my carafe, I am able to take it off the hot plate and just nuke my last cup.  With this new coffee maker, this is not an option. I love being able to take the water reservoir off to fill and the design was very nice and easy to use/clean. But...I'm back to my old Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker which I've had for 3 yrs."
"June 1, 2017",J. A. Sperling,5.0,One,"After years of using expensive Kcups my wife an I decided to go back to ground coffee. After a little research we settled on the Hamilton Beach Brew Station 48464. We choose this model because reviews of the newer model with the external reservoir reported leaking issues. We also choose the Brew Station because we wanted to avoid the traditional glass carafe. Also the price was good and we really didn't want too many features Today was our first try and out of the box this product is great. Woke up and pressed the On button and perking began. Coffee brews quickly and is relatively quite so those still sleeping were not woken up by the ""perking"" process. Placing your cup under the dispenser is easy and doesn't require a hard press. Coffee tasted great and was very hot even after sitting for 2 hours. The only issues is when you have to fill the system with water and coffee. If your Brew Station sits under a cabinet you will need to pull it out to open the top and this maybe a little cumbersome. Overall so far a great way to brew and dispense coffee and avoid the constant cost and purchase of Kcups."
"May 9, 2021",AL KRAI,3.0,,Love this machine if only it would not make a boiling noise when just keeping coffee warm! My family has the exact same coffee maker and theirs does not do that? Upon further inspection on top of the plate in the bottom of the coffee reservoir is a large burn spot! as much as I love this I cannot with good conscience recommend this!
"January 16, 2018",shop girl,5.0,One,"I was so sad when my cute little DeLonghi broke... ordered this because of good reviews and I loved the fact that there’s no carafe to clean/break. I love this so much now I’d never go back. I can set it for right before I wake up, and it’s so easy to use and clean. Haven’t made iced coffee yet but excited to try with this."
"September 26, 2020",DoveandRaven,1.0,,"I purchased 3 of these... One for our new home, one for my sister and one for my daughter. All three at about the year mark - began just leaking water everywhere from the bottom. Could be made with sturdier materials - I would say that... but super disappointing because its a great machine - UNTIL IT FLOODS the whole counter consistently. Buy but don't expect it to last."
"March 9, 2021",Dianne Smih,1.0,,"My old Brewmaster (different model) lasted for years.  The one leaked BAD around the push bar...the very first time I used it!  Called Amazon and they replaced it immediately and sent a 2nd.  It leaked a little.  I tried tightening the screws...but it got worse with time.  Thank goodness I had purchased a slider to sit it on or it would have ruined my granite counter top!!!  By this time, it was too late to call Amazon.  I called Hamilton Beach and told them my problem...  It was still under warranty and they replaced with my old model that I requested.  Take heed before you order, it must be a bad design.  I am very happy again, with my old faithful...model 47950."
"November 25, 2015",msbiz,5.0,13,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! this coffee maker. Did I mention that I LOVE this coffee maker? First...I don't often write reviews for products I buy...who has the time? For THIS, however, I feel compelled to tell my story: I've had the same coffee maker for over 25 years and, although there was nothing wrong with it, I just wanted a newer, nicer, match-my-cool-kitchen-decor one. Oh! And...it had to make BETTER coffee than my old one. So...the researcher started researching and researching and reading and studying and musing, etc. I immediately discarded the idea of a one-cup maker because I didn't want all those little cups laying around...even in a special ""little cup holder thingy"" or have to (heaven forbid!) FILL a little cup every time I wanted a cupa Joe! Then, I began to consider GLASS carafe vs STAINLESS carafe; but all the reviewers basically had problems with both. I literally stumbled on a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coffee maker (you know that ""people also considered these"" at the bottom of the Amazon page). It was a BREWSTATION...yes! like a soda DISPENSER station...NO CARAFE! The reviews were fantastic and so, after weeks of searching and researching, I ordered the Hamilton Beach BrewStation Ultra with the Amazon gift card Sweetie gave me for my birthday. It arrived yesterday....on my birthday! Set up was a breeze! I even figured out, in a second, how to ""program"" it to have the coffee ready when I woke up (always a plus!). I've NEVER had one that did this...I had to push the button and then stand around with my cup in my hand WAITING!!! So...this morning, I wake up and my first thought was, ""OMG...there's probably coffee all over the counter and seeped into the drawers and leaked onto the floors because I probably did something wrong and now I have a big mess to clean up! But no!! The first thing that hit me, as I rounded the corner to the side of the house where the kitchen is, was the AROMA of fresh brewed coffee!!! YIPPPPEEE! And...no mess!! So, I take my mug, pour a little 1/2 and 1/2 into it, and gently press it against the little bar on the front of the BrewStation and VIOLA!! COFFEE!! But...now comes the TRUE TEST...does it TASTE good?!! All the reviewers raved about the taste; but, to be sure, taste is a matter of...well...TASTE! OH! MY! the FIRST sip was like JAVA HEAVEN! And I kept sipping...could not stop sipping! THE BEST...and I mean it...THE BEST tasting coffee I ever had...bar none! No bitter taste; perfect strength (I followed directions for 1 level Tablespoon/cup and made 6 cups....which is probably about 2 or 3 of my big mug). I used my own coffee blend; but am anxious to try others, like Dunkin' Donuts, which I bought on sale at Costso last week. Now..the best part: it keeps the coffee hot for UP TO FOUR HOURS...without ""burning"" it...remember, there's no ""hot plate"" and at a consistent temperature. I tested out this feature by leaving a little bit of coffee in the maker...just to see how this would work for me, because coffee rarely lasts 4 hours with me. The last sip was just as good and just as hot as the first! Wonderful! Speaking of HOT...PERFECT for drinking! Not McDonald's ""hot"", that you have to wait for an hour to take a sip or ""coolish hot"", so that you have to stick it in the microwave to get it right...no...it was PERFECT drinking temperature! PERFECT! So...that's my story and I might just have to make another pot today...just because I can! If YOU are in the market for a coffee maker, here's your chance. And...doesn't cost the farm....about $45 on Amazon (free shipping for me bc I'm a Prime member) and I also bought the little gold basket, so it was around $55...as I see it, that's an EXCELLENT price compared to those one-cuppers. Cheers!!"
"October 27, 2019",Kelly Elizabeth Cameron,5.0,,So glad I discovered this coffee maker. It has a timer so I can make ahead the night before and have fresh delicious coffee in the morning. My favorite feature is the internal storage coffee pot that keeps coffee hot for up to 4 hours. Any time I want a fresh cup (or to top off my current cup) I just press my cup against the button and it dispenses hot coffee right in my cup. Love it!
"May 24, 2018",laurie,5.0,,"After over 1 year of use, the holding carafe started leaking. Found a replacement for $20 on another website. I still rate this 5 stars. it cost roughly $0.15 per brew plus coffee cost. Still saves so much money over buying coffee anywhere else. If you push really hard on the dispense button the unit slides. Pushing really hard on the dispense button does not make the coffee come out faster. You don't have to push hard on the button. Love that I can reheat coffee that is already in it by holding the on/off button to bypass the brew step. It's sleek, and fits under my cabinet no problem ( i put the unit away after use for more counter space). Really happy."
"May 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,We have had a couple of these - we love the coffee it makes and the convenience of ready coffee without the carafe.  It's really perfect for us -  BUT - we are on our third one - they only last about a year.  The lever/valve that releases the coffee stops working so there is no way to get the great tasting coffee out.  So it is a great concept - but doesn't last.
"June 9, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"This maker didn’t even last a year. We had the old model for years and it was great. When it finally needed replacing, we wanted the same one and purchased the newer model. A few months in and it started brewing only 10 of the 12 cups of water. Then it was 8. We are now at 2 of the 12 cups of water get brewed. It leaves the water in the reservoir but thinks it’s done brewing. Complete waste of money for this new version. Don’t waste the money!"
"January 7, 2013",E. Tom,5.0,,"This is my second Hamilton Beach Brewstation coffeemaker and I've been very pleased with both of them.  My first one lasted about 2 years before the nozzle where the coffee dispenses from got rather clogged up and the flow of coffee slowed dramatically.  But, I figured 2 years was an acceptable length of time for a coffeemaker to last. Prior to the Brewstation, I had a Cuisinart coffeemaker of the same type of design, a dispenser type from a built in tank rather than a glass carafe.  The Hamilton Beach model has performed much better than the more expensive Cuisinart did and lasted longer. I like this type of coffeemaker as it makes a great tasting cup of coffee, it keeps the coffee nice and hot and it dispenses coffee one cup at a time.  The Brewstation Summit Ultra model offers some improvements over my first Brewstation.  It's taller so there is more room to fit a tall mug underneath the nozzle and to see how full the cup is as the coffee is dispensed.  It offers more options on the length of time before the unit automatically shuts itself off.  It has ""bold"" or ""regular"" brew strength settings.  .It has a ""window"" on each side of the tank that makes it easier to see how much coffee is left in the tank than the previous model.  It has a reminder in the display that tells you when it's time to perform maintenance (running vinegar through the unit to de-calcify it) and this model also is capable of making iced coffee.  Also, the design looks a lot nicer as it's sleeker looking and has more stainless steel accents on it and it also has a larger drip tray. You do have to be a little careful about how quickly you fill the coffeemaker with water when preparing to make a pot of coffee.  The filler bucket has a spout with a tab that runs across the top of the spout and I've found that if you try to fill too quickly, that tab makes water drip down the side of the tank onto your countertop.  Fill the tank slower and you won't get these drips.  Also, if you make a full pot, you have to be careful if you move the coffeemaker as there is an overflow opening in the rear of the tank which water can splash out of if you move the cofeemaker too quickly.  One final warning is that you have to make sure you don't fill the paper filter with too many coffee grounds when making a full pot or the grounds can flow out over the top of your filters and into the tank.  If you follow these warnings, I think you'll be quite pleased with this coffeemaker!"
"October 9, 2019",Debra Hart,5.0,,Love this coffee maker and this is the 3rd one I’ve owned over the past 9 years.  The coffee does not get bitter when stored in the receptacle and is easy to dispense.  It seems to have a shelf life of about 3 years after which the on/off button fails and it doesn’t always turn off.  Still rating it with high marks because I love it so much.
"April 20, 2016",Actual Wizard,4.0,,"A very simple to use product that requires minimal cleaning and preparation, as well as several useful functions such as Keep Warm timer and a Set Time if you want your coffee to brew automatically in the morning. It arrived within a few days and took only a few minutes to set up. The only real dislike I have about the product is that the recommended amount of coffee grounds is far less than you actually need for a good cup of coffee. The instruction manual warns against using more than 1 teaspoon of coffee grounds per cup of water, but when I did this, I got brown-tinged coffee-flavored water that was very unpleasant to taste. I would personally recommend at least a tablespoon and a half, if not more, depending on your personal preference."
"January 31, 2014",aligaterr,5.0,,"This is our second BrewStation.  We got this to replace our old one that started leaking (btw, it started leaking only because I messed with the mechanism... long story). We've had it for about a month and I really love it, but it does have some characteristics that are strange, as mentioned in some of the of the other reviews left here. 1. Most of the time it does make a weird sound.  I'm pretty sure it's the heating element that keeps the coffee hot in the tank, but our old one did not make any kind of sound like this.  I'll just hope it's not an indication of a problem. 2. I think the temperature of the hot coffee is perfect, but we are not people that like to drink scalding hot coffee.  I appreciate that I can actually drink the coffee when I get a cup, instead of waiting for 20 minutes so I don't burn my tongue.  If you like REALLY hot coffee, then this BrewStation may not be your best bet. 3. Love... L.O.V.E. the removable water tank.  The older model did not have this and you had to fill the water tank.  It is so much more pleasant to be able to just remove the tank, fill it up, then put it back for brewing.  Probably the best upgrade they made to their BrewStation. So far so good.  Hopefully it will keep on ticking and last."
"January 4, 2021",Lynda B.,2.0,,"This is my second Hamilton Beach internal storage coffee pot and this is the newer edition that replaced my last one. Pros- Love the internal storage and on demand dispensing Love the size LOVE the internal filter to keep coffee grounds out of my cup Cons- I purchased this one to replace my older version Hamilton Beach because that one leaked This one leaks too- A LOT- more as time goes on, so much so that it is being thrown away. Hamilton Beach- I've contact you with no response. Please correct these issues"
"December 3, 2019",Brette J Tingle,5.0,One,This is my 3rd one!  I have one at my CG unit and just brought my 2nd one to my hotel.  This one has improvements over the previous ones.  I LOVE not have to mess with a pot.  Once you go this route you will never go back to a pot!
"March 7, 2016",Nick Hearon,3.0,3,"Overall, it does what it's supposed to.  It makes coffee and keeps it warm.  My only major complaints are, for one, it takes a little while.  It usually takes about 10 minutes to brew a pot of coffee which isn't horrible, but when I was at a friends over the weekend and her coffee maker made a pot in  3 minutes, I realized how slow mine was, and in the mornings when I'm in a hurry to class, it can make all the difference.  The other complaint I have is it is kind of difficult to clean by the nature of the design.  Don't get me wrong, for what it is, it's well designed, but it is more difficult to clean than just a regular coffee pot.  Otherwise, I have no complaints!"
"April 24, 2021",ddwilson,2.0,,"The process to make coffee is easy. Light weight water dispenser is nice, but after 6-8 months, the water doesnt totally process through the machine. It will make 2 cups and stop. After pressing stop and start 3x it will fully complete 10 cups. The warmer is nice, but loud. Hindsight,  I would have shopped around more."
"June 30, 2020",Daniel,3.0,,"Dispenser button was difficult to engage out of the box - you have to hold the back of the coffee maker to keep it in place while you push your coffee cup against the dispenser.  After only 6 weeks of using, the dispenser button got stuck which allowed a full pot of coffee to dispense all over my counter. The manufacturer advertises that the warming design keeps coffee fresh without the burnt taste - I did not find this to be true.  The longer it sat, the more burnt it tastes to me.  Also, the warmer is loud - keeps making brewing noise for hours after the pot is brewed."
"January 13, 2014",Toni and Mark Z,3.0,2,"I have used a Cuisinart brew station coffee maker for the past few years. last week, it bit the dust. I logged on to amazon to order a replacement. Saw others had ordered the  Hamilton Beach brew-station. I checked reviews on both, Reviews were about equal,and the  Hamilton Beach brew-station was much less expensive. So, I thought, save $30, and I ordered it. I've been using it for a couple of days now. as I said, it's a good coffee maker, no real complaints. However, it's going to move into storage to keep for backup and order the Cuisinart brew station as I originally planned.  Why? These may seem like small differences it's like a Ford will get you to your destination but a Lincoln will get you there a little nicer.  1st, the Cuisinart has a small light over the dispensing spout. Nice early morning if you're not ready to have the kitchen lit. 2nd. the access to the lever to dispense the coffee in more comfortable location. 3rd, the holding tray for the cup/mug is larger (my cups don't fit) 4th, easier to add water with removable tank. The upside for the  Hamilton Beach brew-station, 1st, there are brewing strength options. 2nd, an option to brew iced coffee. 3rd,smaller counter footprint may be important for some.  For the money it's a great buy."
"January 8, 2018",Blackhawks,4.0,One,"Nice coffee maker, only has 1 design flaw which is the bar you push your cup against to dispense the coffee.  I have had 2 of these now but the bar fails due to a design flaw.  You get to the point where you can NOT dispense coffee.  The first one I had lasted about a year, no other problems, and then it wouldn't dispense coffee.  The 2nd one I had lasted almost 2 1/2 years.  I love all the other features but wish they would fix the flaw in the dispensing bar."
"July 7, 2020",Shell,3.0,One,"I wanted to like this coffee maker SO bad! I love the idea of not having a carafe, but the dispenser needs to be revised. As you can see in my video, the coffee comes out nicely ar first, but then starts trickling down the side of the machine, all over the outside of the mug, button and tray. Having to wipe down my mug everytime I get coffee is not worth it to me. Also, the button is getting coffee inside it, so I’d imagine mold will start to grow in there. Unfortunately I had to return this item."
"March 11, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"We bought one of these coffee makers about 10 years ago, from Kohl's department store.  It was still going strong, but it was getting dingy looking.  To my amazement, the same machine was still being made and readily available on Amazon, so we replaced and retired our old one.  The new ones works just as well as the first one - no complaints whatsoever!"
"December 22, 2019",Gre,3.0,,"Nice for the price. Pros: keeps your coffee warm for 4 hours. Easy to read coffee and water levels. Cons: lightweight,  if you don't push it against the wall it will slide backwards, even when full. The coffee level window is on the side, so you're limited in placement unless you don't really care depending on your coffee usage. "" nothing to do with the product "" I wish the shipper would have at least put it in a box rather than only in its original box, this was an xmas present. Luckily I got it before it was discovered."
"April 7, 2016",MelB,5.0,,"I got online to purchase this specific product.  Had one years ago.  Loved it then.  Lost it in a move - Well, let's get honest.  I lived with a roommate.  It was hers.  She took it with her.  I was so sad to see this coffee maker go!  It has taken a couple of years a couple of less expensive purchases for me to finally get fed up and buy the one I actually wanted.  To be honest, I was looking of the 10 cup.  But, this one is less money, and it looks nicer.  Keeps coffee hot for up to 4 hours.  You can program this.  Has a clock for preset brewing, so you can wake up with your coffee made and ready to go for you.  Looks nice.  Fits traveler coffee mugs under spout.  And. . . My partner just thinks it is really cool to have a pour spout coffee delivery system.  So nice!  Fast delivery."
"February 12, 2021",Donna Cunetto,1.0,,I have used this style of Hamilton Beach coffee maker for 15 years. I have always loved them that is why I ordered another. They changed the style and the water chamber that was always on the side is now inside. They drip pan use to come off for cleaning now it doesn't.  When you put your cup up to the dispenser coffee spills everywhere. I am so disappointed in this coffee maker. It also does not make the coffee hot enough.  They should have left this product alone and not changed it. I start my day angry every morning as coffee is all over my counter top. What a piece of junk. Why did they change the design as I stated i have used a Brewstation for 15 years and they have ruined it.
"September 27, 2016",Texas Mama,2.0,2,"I really really wanted to like this coffee maker and disregarded the poor reviews, thinking the negative points were exaggerated. They weren't. The coffee REALLY ISN'T hot when it comes out. The coffee REALLY IS  poor tasting  (maybe because the water never reaches optimum brewing temp) The blue light REALLY IS overly bright at all times. There REALLY IS a hissing sound the entire time the machine is on. These things bug me. My 20 dollar Mr.Coffee made better coffee. That being said,  this coffee maker looks pretty. And the iced coffee makes very good iced coffee. I was surprised by that. So, I will not order this product again after it craps out. I may go so far as to replace it before it gets the chance."
"June 8, 2016",debenbrie,2.0,,"Well, I thought I would love it like I did with my 6 cup Hamilton Beach coffee maker.  Unfortunately, the coffee maker is far inferior to it's smaller cousin.  This coffee maker leaks...... a lot.  So, imagine it is bright and early, you hit the coffee maker that you know you set up 7 cups.  Now, you are tipping the coffee maker just trying to get 5 cups after coffee has ""DISAPPEARED"".  It leaks under the hot plate,  every single time, clean or not.  So, not only do you have a mess to clean, but your coffee is too strong because 2 cups of water is missing.  I read that the company is aware of this design flaw per the reviews here on the product.  But here it is, still for sale.  Yay for customer service, NOT.  I won't buy another Hamilton Beach even though the smaller one is a good machine.  I just don't trust the company anymore."
"March 4, 2014",Just the Man,3.0,,"We had a Hamilton Beach BrewStation similar to their 48464 and loved it for years but it finally gave up the ghost.  I chose this one because it is similar, but had a side reservoir for the water, which is very easy to use and eliminates spills as well.  But there were a couple of things that this one fell short on.  One is that it had a smaller heating element so it had to heat to a higher temperature to keep the whole carafe hot.  It did keep it at a constant temperature but it did end up giving the coffee a burnt flavor in a shorter time than our older one, which we could put on 3 hours before we could taste the burnt flavor.  Neither over heated the coffee though.  The other is the angle of the tab to fill your cup: on this one, you had to angle your cup just right to get the hot coffee to flow, making it more frustrating.  Also, it was much harder to empty the used coffee filter as it was bulkier and the carafe was also bulkier, making it harder to pour from it.  I admit it wasn't designed to have to pour coffee from it, but on occasion, you may want to pour from it and it's impossible not to spill.  Again, it wasn't designed to be used that way, but the other BrewStations are designed with a pour spout.  We did contact Hamilton Beach directly about the burning and other issues and they sent a replacement out, the other model style, with only paying shipping/handling.  Very good customer support."
"April 29, 2016",boomersgang,4.0,,"We had one of these awhile back and loved it, but it eventually stopped working. We got a Keurig, but it's inconvenient when a thermos full is needed. So we bought another of these. Piece of advice: MEASURE YOUR SPACE! I assumed this was the same as our previous one, but it's unfortunately about 1/2"" too high to fit on our counter underneath the overhanging cupboards. Grrrrr.... I found a spot to put it, but it's not the optimal place for a coffee maker and it's going to bug me. However, my fault - I assumed most were standard size. It took a few minutes to figure it out as it does have some other minor differences that the last one. Works great so far and I love that the coffee stays fresh and hot in the coffee maker for up to 4 hours rather than become cold quickly in a carafe (that was the main point of purchasing this one)."
"December 6, 2017",james maucher,4.0,,"I agree with it makes lousy coffee if you use the suggested paper filters. Cone coffee makers are always the best. I started using cone paper filters and it dramatically changed the coffee. I was planning on returning it because I can’t stand bad coffee. However in combination of how fast this makes coffee and the cone paper discovery I kept it. The coffee is ok now not the best but I have to have my coffee fast so if your like me; like coffee taste not flavored water, and have to have it fast....this might be your maker. One gripe is you can’t control the heat and after the coffee has been sitting it’s not hot but Luke. I really don’t like that. If I had it to do again I’d spring for a good cone maker."
"November 3, 2019",S. Ellis,1.0,,"Has all the options and is easy to clean, but unfortunately has a terrible system for making or storing coffee in a warm state. The coffee holding area is completely uninsulated so that the heat is instantly lost, and the heating element imparts the same awful flavor that keeping coffee on direct heat always does without actually keeping it warm. Makes truly terrible coffee."
"May 25, 2021",E. Layfield,1.0,,"Sucked.  I saw reviews about older model (black) one leaking.  This one leaked too.  And I couldn't figure out where.  After almost a month and it leaking all on counter and sometimes onto the floor, I returned it.  Easy return to Amazon through Kohls though.  It was easy to set clock and program to brew.  Just leaked."
"May 19, 2021",Nancy P,5.0,,"I owned a previous Hamilton Beach Internal Storage Coffee Maker just like this, and it lasted 20+ years! I loved it SOOOO much! So when I saw this upgraded model (well, what wouldn't be upgraded after 20 years), I was THRILLED!  And again, I am not let down by Hamilton Beach!  Looks so pretty on my kitchen counter! Thanks Hamilton Beach!"
"May 22, 2020",AACurrier,5.0,,Love this maker! However we’ve only had about 7 months and now all the sudden it doesn’t want to brew. It will turn on and start warming up but it doesn’t pull water and then will turn itself off.  We cleaned it by running a vinegar/water mixture (which it did Brew somehow).  Its not overly used.  I would say 5 times per week. Anyone experience similar issues? Sad...
"June 5, 2018",Chuck,1.0,,"Not very well thought out.  The ""grip"" on the counter top is terrible and/or the spring tension is too high as you have to push hard against the unit to get coffee to dispense.  I tried multiple items to try to grip it and keep it from sliding, but nothing worked.  The reservoir tank should also have a slight slope TOWARDS where the coffee comes out - not away from it.  Also, the coffee wasn't very hot when compared to other coffee makers.  It got donated as I wasn't interested in shipping it back.  Try again Hamilton Beach..."
"April 15, 2020",Borsalino A.,5.0,,"After over two years of daily use, I've replaced with another. The actual brewing works just fine, but a piece of plastic broke off of the internal side of the button that dispenses the coffee. During these two plus years, it has done its job and done it well. I have 0 complaints about this coffee maker whatsoever."
"August 6, 2014",A Dogged shopper,3.0,,"I wish I could like this a lot more, both as an owner of an earlier model--and as a new refugee from Keurig. But, it's just so-so. Here's some Ps & Cs: Pro: It's EZ to set up; brews fast enough unless you're on on-call firefighter; cleans up reasonably EZ, including two dishwasher-safe parts; keeps coffee warm for an hour or two. Good selections of number of cups to brew and ""bold"" or standard. Unlike Keurig, et. al, I don't have to clean after every cup Cons: A bit bulky, if you're tight for counter space; a lingering plastiky taste; some of the grounds accumulate at bottom--onto the heating element; belches steam like a hot tub in MN in Jan; and if there's a ""ready"" beep I never have heard it,; would be a nice addition. Filling water is EZ enough but seeing the number of cups mark inside is not EZ. Just doesn't produce that ""gotcha"" coffee taste, but I'm hoping later it will."
"June 14, 2018",BNNS Radio,5.0,One,"We really love this item. Works beautifully and coffee is ready when I get out of bed and that is good. Stays very hot, also very good. The only thing I find negative about the unit is the deep cleaning is not an easy project. I don't have any problems as I am a fixer so working with small things is simple for me, however if a person is not handy with fixer jobs, cleaning can eventually make the pot not work as well. Time and patience is needed for a good cleaning about every six months. A good product."
"January 16, 2020",BRENT H.,5.0,,"The only thing I didn't like was the button to release the coffee into the cup. I would have rather had a button on top somewhere because if the machine isn't against a wall or being held with your offhand it will slide across the countertop when filling your cup. Not a huge deal, but some people are more easily annoyed than me."
"December 30, 2016",Mark S.,5.0,One,"No messy carafe to break or dribble coffee everywhere + Has a clock, shut off timer and start brew timer + brews great coffee and dispenses it a cup at a time = One happy java junkie! This replaced a traditional coffee maker I had for almost 10 years that finally gave up and quit on me right after making it's last pot of coffee. This brew station is a little slower at making coffee, but the end result is a mighty fine cop o' joe. Easy to use, easy to clean and easy to operate. I'm happy I made the purchase as I researched a blue million coffee makers and hope this lasts at least half the years I had the old one for."
"September 2, 2015",Melissa,4.0,,"We love this coffee maker, it is a little bit less heavy-duty feeling than the last one we owned.  We had the older model of the same machine and were forced to buy a new one after the old tank developed a leak in the bottom.  I assume this happens over time due to the constant heating and cooling of the plastic and metal seams where the heating element sits against.  Overall, these are great machines and our last one lasted something like 7 years.  No worries about breaking a glass carafe or having to scour burnt coffee out of it.  Our friends are constantly commenting how cool it is to walk up with their cup and dispense their own cup.  Very convenient overall, although one area they could improve upon is maing the area beneath the dispenser slightly taller. Some of our larger travel mugs have a difficult time fitting in the dispensing area unless canted sideways and a few times this has resulted in spilled hot coffee on the counter or on my feet."
"December 10, 2013",Stuart R. Hammett,5.0,,"Once you try this incomparable coffee maker, you will never, ever go back to a conventional glass carafe-type drip coffee pot.  It makes very good coffee, which can be dispensed into your cup one-handed.  Preparation and brewing are simple and quick, no matter how drowsy or hung over you may be, or set it up the night before to have coffee hot and ready when needed.  The coffee stays hot and fresh-tasting all day, as necessary, never burning nor cooking down to toxic sludge.  Hard to believe?  Maybe, but it's true! Since discovering the Brewstation about ten years ago, it's been the only coffee maker in our home.  We just recently bought our fourth.  A very few minor changes have been made over the years, mostly just to freshen up the cosmetics or tweak the simple, intuitive programmable controls.  I suspect that one machine would have lasted the entire time for most families, but I really abuse mine; without the occasional, recommended cleaning, they can eventually get clogged or develop undesirable tastes.  I had one heating element burn out, which isn't terribly surprising, given my egregious, non-stop coffee habit. Our house guests are always impressed, and at least twice, the visitors soon purchased their own soon. HB Brewstations are that good!"
"May 10, 2021",AuntiePen,1.0,,I had this same coffee maker and wanted a new one when the first one quit working after 6 years. This new one was defective and leaked coffee all over the kitchen counter as it was made. I contacted the company and they are sending a new one...but I have to pay shipping ☹️  I’m giving one star only because it’s a requirement
"December 7, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Ordered this and because of the good reviews. We received the first one and the cheap plastic brew button wouldn't work at all. Called Hamilton Beach Customer Service and they sent us a replacement. The second one brewed coffee, but leaked water all over the counter. We tried ensuring that the tank was pushed in tight in case that was the problem, but it still leaks. I am talking about a full cup of water. We are returning one and the other will go into the trash. I miss the old days when everything wasn't made out of the cheapest thinnest plastic. We will just go to Costco tomorrow and get one so we don't have to hassle returning items."
"July 25, 2019",Paula M.,3.0,,"This is an interesting concept.  We brew 10 cups of water every day (4 large cups of coffee).  We like to just get our coffee and not wait for pods to brew.  For two years it's worked very well, tho it's not especially easy to pour the water in the reservoir (no real biggie there).  Lately tho, it has slowed down considerably, taking over 15 minutes to brew.  Also it's very slow dispensing now.  But the worst thing is as it gets to the last cup of coffee, it leaks while dispensing, making a mess on the counter and necessitating wiping off the cup as well.  While I liked the idea of not having a carafe (another thing that would break eventually!), I'm not at all pleased that the issues we're having are forcing us to replace it after only 2 years."
"April 13, 2021",Jeff,1.0,,"Had one of these a few years ago and loved it. Wore out current coffee maker so gladly ordered one of these. Horrible mistake. Coffee leaks all over counter while dispensing coffee into cup. Thought it might be just a bad one so we sent it back and received another one. Did the same exact thing! Love how the coffee tastes, the temperature of the coffee and the functions on the coffee maker. Too bad you can’t get a cup of coffee without cleaning up coffee off of your counter top. It leaks at the back of the dispenser , fills up the little spill cup and then all over the counter. Hamilton Beach needs to rethink their dispenser function . Wasted our money. Would not purchase again"
"March 8, 2021",Sarah Browning-Larson,4.0,,"We have used this type of coffee maker and have had good luck with it for years. They usually last for about 2 years. We only use filtered water.  However, this last one is starting to have issues and is just 11-months old.  It has to be restarted 3 times to use all the water in the reservoir.  We are going to change to a different brand to see how that goes. We may be back."
"June 17, 2020",FibroWarrior,5.0,,"First time we bought one in store but sadly we can no longer find this near us. Glad we could still get it online, this is my husband’s favorite coffee pot it’s perfect for him in the morning before work. I recommend using it with a reusable basket filter. Extra tip add a little bit of salt to your grounds to cut the bitterness."
"August 9, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Went fom the expensiv 1 cup coffee makers to the Hamilton beach and have never regretted it.  It will make coffee any way you like it, strong medium week you control the coffee, no coffee sludge in the bottom of the cup, make as little or as much as you want.  Set the timer or when you want it to start and just let it take it from there, your coffee will be ready when you get up, or make it when you want it.  For the price you cant go wrong and that is my opinion, by the way all of my friends now have this coffee maker."
"April 20, 2021",sue b,1.0,,"I had very bad luck with this machine. Returned first one for replacement and the 2nd one did the same thing.  Coffee stored in carafe after brewing process all leaked out into the machine and onto the countertop and floor. Perhaps I'm missing something,  but I'm not trying again. I have an 8 month old lab puppy running amok from too much spilled caffeine.  Love the design.  Sorry it was faulty."
"June 13, 2016",Teresa,4.0,2,"I've changed my review to 4 stars from 5 stars, because of an issue with the feet.  It is a bit bulky- about 1/3 larger than a normal coffeemaker, and a bit wider (15"" tall x 71/2"" wide x 101/2"" deep). The coffee tank is above the reservoir, and the filter basket is above the tank.  I found if I followed the directions of using 1 tbsp of coffee to one cup of coffee (my cups hold 12 oz), the coffee was too strong for me.  By cutting the coffee amount in half, the strength is the same as that of my previous coffeemaker.  The same goes for the iced coffee- I cut the recommended amount of coffee in half.  Making hot coffee is easy; iced coffee is a bit complicated.  It takes lots of ice, as well as measuring the water carefully, so the tank doesn't overflow.  But in time, this should be second nature.  It has 2 grey-white plastic feet on the bottom rear.  One kept falling out, and the last time I tried to put it back into the hole, it was pushed in to far to retrieve it.  I called the manufacturer about this, and learned the parts on the bottom are not replaceable.  The rep said she'd inform the design people about this.  It still stands solidly on the counter however.  It's quirks are balanced by not having to deal with a carafe., and by being able to have a good cup of iced coffee at home.  If you want to try out this coffeemaker as soon as it arrives, have cupcake type filters available.  I'd buy it again."
"May 18, 2019",jmanly,2.0,,"I've had it about 2.5 years now but it's getting tossed. It went from a nice flow when you pressed the release to more of a dribble.  Everything else works perfect but with no flow on an internal pot it's useless. Used multiple cleaning products with no results.  I would expect better quality from Hamilton beach. If it weren't for this problem it would get full stars, I love this pot."
"February 1, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,It worked as expected the first 2 months. It doesn’t work anymore. I tried calling 3 days ago to get a replacement and was told someone from Hamilton Beach would call in 1-2 days. No call. I called back today (3 days later) to follow up. I’m told that Hamilton Beach customer service is closed on the weekends and if I can call back on Monday. Very disappointing.
"December 18, 2020",ms poovy,1.0,,I bought this to replace my Cuisinart that is similar (no carafe). I’ve had the same Cuisinart model for about 13 years and love it. When it finally died they no longer make that model so I purchased this hoping it would work as well. No it did not. It leaked all around the dispense bar coffee all over the countertop.  Hamilton Beach needs to call Cuisinart and find out how to make a carafe-less coffee maker.  Don’t wast your money.
"May 15, 2020",2Bwelding,5.0,,"Superior value. Well designed. Easy to clean. Prohibits removal of coffee reservoir unless it's empty. Most importantly, makes excellent coffee. I choose the Bold setting and only use a quality 100% Colombian beans. Nonetheless, albeit a new machine, it makes an even better Cup than an unfiltered pour-over. ""Keep warm"" function doesn't leave you with a ""cooked"" or bitter result. Highly recommend."
"December 27, 2013",Lynne,3.0,2,"I bought this brewer to replace a similar Hamilton Beach dispensing brewer that I had had for 5 or 6 years - the carafe on it was leaking and they didn't sell replacement carafes for that model any more. I've used this 47950 brewer several times a week for about a month now. This brewer makes coffee very well, and quickly.  My old one did not have a separate water reservoir, the water got put right into the brewer. This has a separate water tank, which is convenient, but makes the brewer take up a few inches more counter space.  Not a problem if you have a lot of counters, but those extra few inches may be a problem if this is the brewer you leave out all the time for every day use.  The dispenser button is a little hard to press in, I'd be afraid to use delicate coffee cups with it, but I have no problem using sturdy mugs.  I've used both 2 and 3 hour 'keep warm' settings - it keeps the coffee very hot - to the point of almost boiling.  I've not had a problem with burnt taste or scorching, but I could see that happening if it's left on long with only a cupful left in it warming.  My biggest problem with this brewer is the clean-up.  I have yet to find a convenient way way to clean out the grounds without making a mess.  The coffee is kept so hot (nice) that there is a lot of steam produced that keeps the used grounds very wet and drippy (not so nice).  And when you lift the lid to get to the grounds all the steam that has condensed on it runs both into the back of the coffee tank and onto the grounds, making the grounds even wetter. even wetter. When you lift out the basket to dump the grounds it drips across the counter, kitchen floor, trash bin, wherever you have to go to dump your grounds. There are multiple holes in the grounds holder base, so you can't even just hold a finger over a hole like on other brewers I've had. Sure, to avoid the drippy mess you can hold a cloth or paper towel under it, but that's a waste, and also not convenient, but probably the best solution- unless the grounds are hot.  I've also tried lifting the whole coffee tank/grounds basket unit off the base (when the coffee is gone!) to carry the grounds holder to be dumped, but that's not real easy either, especially if the unit is hot - I've had to do this when needing to make more coffee right away.  Overall, I'd be hesitant to recommend this, but wouldn't know what to get instead, it seems every machine/brand has its quirks, problems or ridiculous high prices, so I'll stick with this until it leaks or breaks."
"August 17, 2020",MoeFam09,4.0,,"I love the new coffee maker. I searched all over for another one with a push dispenser as our old old mr.coffee was on the fritz. My only complaint, and it's kind of a big one, is that when you are dispensing coffee it leaks down the side. Luckly there is a drip pan but I still feel as if this shouldn't happen."
"November 26, 2017",arcticmom,1.0,2,"Unfortunately, about 2 months after purchase, the coffee won't get hot anymore. We have a slightly different model of this same coffee maker at home and have used it daily for over 2 yrs with no issues. Bought this Hamilton Beach model for work and after only 2 months it won't work properly. Very frustrated!"
"September 1, 2016",Katie,5.0,One,"I was so excited when I found this coffee maker. We have broken at least 4 glass coffee pots. So we decided to switch to a metal one. Well little did I know they do not stay hot very long. My boyfriend and I get up 3.5 hours apart. So we need the coffee to be hot for that long, metal can't do that, 2 max. Then I found this magical coffee maker. It has a setting to keep it hot from 1-4 hours- perfect (and let me tell you, the coffee is HOT) It doesn't have any glass that we can break- perfect. It looks great, works perfectly. I couldn't be happier."
"September 26, 2019",Pubpersona,2.0,,"This is a cheap plastic product -- nothing like Hamilton Beach coffee brewers I have purchased and loved before.  We've used it for a few months and I am increasingly more dissatisfied every day.  It is so lightweight you either have to hold it in place or punch it against the wall to dispense coffee.  Additionally, the heater never shuts down, so the coffee gets a burnt flavor after a short time.  You can hear it running from a good distance.  Spend your money elsewhere!"
"March 26, 2020",Trudy,2.0,,"We had two order two of these. The first one was broke. No big deal, sent it back and got a replacement. The second one, the button to fill your cup sticks. Ok, we let that go and deal with it, just reach in the back and hope we don't get burned unsticking it. Then, the water in the reservoir doesn't completely empty so there is always water left over to dump out . Now it's dripping out of the bottom and leaking all over the counter. We've had this about one month with all these issues."
"June 2, 2020",Chris M.,1.0,,"Had an older version of this that died on us after about 5 years. Unfortunately it's the only brand we can find that has this built in carafe functionality, so we decided to try a new one. The first one leaked out the back every time you went to fill your mug, so we figured it was a fluke, and Amazon sent us another one to try. The replacement had an even worse leak! We are forced to keep a towel underneath it at all times. Hamilton Beach customer service has been awful to work with. They volunteered to send us a 3rd, but after a ton of back and forth getting the picture JUST RIGHT to prove I actually own it, I am about to throw in the towel on this brand altogether and get something else as I am 99% sure whatever THIRD unit they are about to send us is going to have the same problem... Bummer!"
"February 28, 2016",Amazon Customer,1.0,7,"I had an early version of this coffee maker several years ago that was much better quality. This one is NOT good! The coffee tastes fine, but I have coffee leak underneath the machine on a regular basis. Everything looks fine until I move the coffee maker a few inches as I clean my counters and then I see a puddle of coffee underneath. Also, after about 6 months, the leakage between the coffee cup and coffee maker is now very common when dispensing coffee. I know how to dispense the coffee, but there is just not enough clearance to have the coffee dispense more into the middle of my cup. Very frustrating and messy. After only a year with this coffee maker, I am back online searching for a replacement. Such a waste."
"July 19, 2020",Janice Wiegartner,2.0,,"Does not perform as well as my old one. I had this exact coffee pot for 10 years. It was time for a new one. When I ordered it I read the reviews. There was one review that said the coffee pot leaked when you pressed to fill the cup. I just figured it was a Lemon, which happens. So I ordered it. The first few times I used it it was fine. Now, every time I go to Fill my coffee cup it leaks where you press to fill the cup. I am extremely disappointed. Shame on me for not paying attention to that one review."
"December 16, 2019",M. M. Moncivais,4.0,,"I love my coffee maker. I love that I don’t have to wait for the whole pot to finish brewing to start enjoying my first cup of coffee. Although if you don’t wait, that first cup is not as hot. I like that I don’t have to lift a heavy coffee pot to pour a cup of coffee. It’s wonderful using the dispenser. Update: A couple years later. We need to get a new coffee maker because this one leaks and for some reason there’s los of leaking underneath. You have to put it on a tray if you don’t want black stuff  on your counter."
"January 30, 2019",roy batty,1.0,One,"If the coffee is made and ready to serve you by pressing the bar, its great. But, if u need to add water for more u will get scalded unless u wear gloves. Due to a 2 bay design 1 for water other for made coffee, it is a cumbersome and HOT process to remove each part to add the water... by 2 all thumbs"
"May 22, 2017",Michael Crumbliss,5.0,One,I replaced my 6 cup Hamilton Beach because it was getting old and temperamental.  I couldn't find a 6 cup replacement which disappoints me since a use 2 to 4 cups all the time and almost never more.  But this model comes with special brew options for 1 - 4 cups and makes GREAT coffee every morning.  It's easier to fill and clean than the previous model and is all around a great buy.
"April 14, 2017",Chook,1.0,One,"After only 6 months the coffee started leaking from the coffee carafe back down to the water chamber. It had a 1 year warranty. After speaking with the company they are replacing the carafe part, charging us for the shipping, and not giving us a delivery date. Company rep said ""at least 14 days"". Not feeling very kindly toward them. Our original brew station lasted years before the valve for dispensing failed. I love the convenience but do not think I will risk buying this product again."
"April 28, 2019",Lillie Powell,5.0,,I had had the same coffee pot that I purchased in 2009 and had been great.  It had developed a small leak so I decide to replace it. This new pot has some really neat upgraded features.  My favorite being the separate water fill tank. I haven’t used it yet but it will make iced coffee which seems great.  I will have to try it out this summer.
"August 23, 2016",Dave Long,5.0,,"Fantastic coffee maker and doesn't burn the coffee. Every carafe we've ever had always dribbled coffee all over the counter when we tried to pour, even if we lifted the lid and sssslllloooowwwlllyyy poured into the cup. What a mess. That's no longer a problem with this machine. Put the cup under the spout, draw your coffee and pull away with no drips at all. One word to HB though: Add a small LED aimed down next to the spout so users can see how much coffee is in the cup when the room is dark. A minor annoyance but easily remedied by your engineers. It should switch on when the draw button is depressed and off when released. Still, we really love your coffee maker."
"March 7, 2014",Mr. Wayne S. Mergott Jr.,4.0,,"First I will say this - I don't drink coffee, only tea, so please read what I say with that in mind. I like to brew my tea in a machine and decided to try this unit because it has no carafe. I have other machines as well and they all do a good job of brewing tea. I drink much iced tea year round as well as hot tea in the morning. To make iced tea I use a maker with a carafe. For drinking tea hot I now use the Brewstation. The unit is very easy to fill and operate and I have no problem dispensing the tea although the machine can move some when you press your cup to fill. I think the big advantage to the Brewstation is that the tea or coffee does not sit on a hot plate after brewing as it would with a carafe type machine - I think this improves the flavor. I use 2 tea bags to easily make about 10 cups on the measure. This results in about 4 full mug type cups full of tea or coffee. I use Tetley tea and some brands might not brew as strong a cup. I've only used the Brewstation for about a week now so I can't comment on how it will last but i think it seems to be a good looking quality product and Hamilton Beach has a good reputation."
"February 19, 2020",SPARK10,1.0,,"Sad to say this purchase was a bust. 15 days after the return window for Amazon, this thing starts leaking all over my counter. We tried to figure out the problem but couldn't understand why it was leaking coffee. Save your money and buy a different coffee maker. This one isn't worth it. Wish I could return for a refund. But there's nothing Amazon can do. And the manufacture wont accept returns from third party sellers."
"November 25, 2020",Country EpiscoPal in the Big City,1.0,,"One year and three months it starts LEAKING ! ! Thank you, everyone for your reviews because I feel less alone and less CRAZY ! Puddles everywhere and I thought it was me. I don't know why, but it just started leaking ALL OVER the place all of a sudden ! Was it worth the 60$ plus to have it for a year? I guess? but not really ... I'm not gonna make the mistake a second time. :-("
"April 25, 2021",mom in illinois,4.0,,I was a little worried with some reviews of the leaking.  The coffee maker does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty so that helped ease my mind.  Overall I like it.  Not 5 stars only because of a few quirks.  The water fill opens to the right.  It blocks the access of using my sprayer to fill it.  I know it is easy to take it off and fill but just wanted to share.  It has to be fully against the wall to push the fill or it won't come out.  For now 4 stars and will review again after 6 months
"May 20, 2020",PaPa,1.0,,"It works. After that it’s a mess trying to clean it. You lift the lid to take out the grounds and water runs down the sides and down behind. You lift the basket and again water drips all over. Lastly once you pour out any remaining coffee and clean the inside, the metal plate that literally boils the coffee to keep it hot requires steel wool or sos pad to clean. I guess you get what you pay for.  I suggest spending more and get a higher quality maker.  If you drink coffee everyday, you’ll regret choosing this one."
"June 29, 2020",Stevo1212,2.0,,"I’ve used this same product in the past without fault, however I believe I received a faulty device this time around. There is a leak somewhere while dispensing, causing coffee to run down the machine behind where your mug would go, into the drip tray and all over the counter. Very frustrating as I waited several weeks to use this and I do not see any options now about returning the product."
"July 30, 2019",Andreina Garcia,3.0,,"La parte de abajo donde se supone va la taza donde te sirves el café , se sale con mucha facilidad eso no me agrado de la cafetera , no trae el colador del café , deben comprarlo , No mantiene el café tan caliente , puedes programar el tiempo que quieres que esté prendida de 1 a 4 horas , la tapa de arriba se sale con mucha facilidad se desarma mucho , eso no me gusta"
"January 24, 2020",Lynne Edwards,3.0,,I gave three stars overall because the black plastic pins that hold the top on the water tank arrived with one broken off. The water tank seems precarious and crooked. Odd. Gives impression of poor engineering and materials. Coffee tastes ok. Easy enough to use and clean. Wish I could receive a new lid for the water tank.
"November 25, 2020",RogerMo,5.0,,"Wife and I like no pot. We don't want to have to life a pot and pour. This is perfect.  Had a Hamilton Beach that lasted 5 plus years before we bought this one. It would still make coffee, but would not use all the water in the reservoir during the brewing cycle. If this one starts that mess, then Hamilton Beach is out the door. So far, so good."
"March 18, 2020",not Mark Twain,1.0,,"We have actually enjoyed this machine for 9-1/2 months. Till last week that is, when is has decided to boil 12 cups of water out without make more that a couple of cups of coffee. Oh, and it take an hour to steam that much coffee (well you could call it that, or burnt caramel).  Tis a sad state of affairs when cars can go for years, and a $55 coffee machine bites the dust in less than a year."
"April 23, 2021",D. T.,4.0,,"We have been using this type of coffee pot for a few years now. My last one just got old and so we got this Hamilton Beach pot. Our first pot was defective, but they exchanged it easily! It's a decent pot but is very loud. I think it's the heating element, it pops and is just loud. Another thing I miss from my last pot is a light at the pour spout. If your pouring in a dark kitchen you can't see how much your getting! But this pot was much cheaper that the pot we had before, so for the price, it does the job!!"
"May 24, 2021",JavaOops,1.0,,"Update: It's 2021 and the second one I bought (this one) has failed.  In 2017 I bought one and it failed about 1.5 years later.  I bought this to replace it, and it failed about 1.5 years later. Avoid this product unless you like replacing often.  Bought a cheap mr coffee when it didn't work one morning, and will not buy another one of these."
"May 19, 2021",Sharon Hanson,4.0,,This is the second brewmaster  I have purchased and this newer model is a piece of junk.  Started leaking just 2 months after purchase.  Customer service is  nonexistant.  Still waiting for a reply of the warranty from customer service. They will only accept emails and the only answer is an automated one sent at the start of the process. UPDATE have heard from customer service and they were very helpful. Said my problem was with the coffee tank and they are sending me a new one at no cost.  Have changed my review to 4 stars
"February 19, 2020",Rhonda Demers,5.0,,"This is a great coffee maker. I just got it today and had to try it out. It makes coffee faster than the original ones do I love the removable water reservoir. Now I won't spill water trying to get it from the sink to the maker. I always make a mess. You can also make ice coffee with this one, I haven't tried it yet but I will soon."
"March 22, 2013",Morticia89,5.0,,"I bought this as a replacement for a standard carafe-style brewer that was only a year old and on the fritz. (Lost my biz Mr. Coffee!) I wanted something that wouldn't burn my coffee after sitting on a heating plate for two hours. With this, my coffee doesn't even last two hours! (Read on for the reason why.) PROS: 1) This brews the best coffee I've ever had, even with the cheap brand I buy to cut costs. 2) The design easily accommodates my large travel mugs as well as my standard cups. 3) Fills easily. 4) Programmable for a future start time (this is a must for me as I need my coffee immediately upon waking). 5) Normal and Strong brew settings. 6) Longer 'keep warm' times than most other brewers--2 is standard on most, this will allow 2, 3, and 4 hr keep-warm settings. CONS: 1) You have to pour the water carefully or you'll slosh it out. I've started using a pitcher to fill it that fits better within the opening. 2) If you don't have your maker on a slide shelf, be careful pushing it back: water can slosh out around the bucket. 3) When opening the lid after brewing (when you're ready to make another pot) condensation is terrible. Have a towel handy to set the filter basket on. Also, the lid is heavy with condensation and if you don't open it quickly you'll have water all over your counter. 4) The lid doesn't always go down flat into the slot. I have to make sure it does otherwise it drips out the front spout. You'd think that's a lot of negatives, but the Pros far outweigh the Cons in this purchase. If you keep in mind what I've mentioned above I think you'll enjoy this maker very much!!"
"December 28, 2013",Tabitha,5.0,One,"I only buy Brewstations because I hate carafes. But because Brewstations never make it to the two-year mark, I buy a lot of them. Even the 'commercial' version lasted only 13 months. I decided this year that because all of the models are jusy about rated the same I'd just get the least expensive. WHY oh WHY did i not do this earlier?! I LOVE THIS MODEL!!! Hands down the best Brewstation design EVER. Totally ergonomically magnificent. Easily-lift off water reservoir is so simple to use and handle -- and fixes an issue I have HATED about these machines: the water reservoirs are clumsy to handle and then you have to pour the water carefully into the machine to brew. The dispenser bar is well-placedm so no more coffee pouring down the back of my mug; you can fill a tall travel cup; there is a keep warm button AND this one actually looks better on my counter than previous models. If it breaks after 13 months I won't care -- it was half the price of my last one. I am just so kiddily happy with this machine...."
"April 27, 2016",Laurie A. Belair,1.0,One,"I have been using Hamilton Beach brew station type coffee pots for about 5 years now. I needed to get a new one, and purchased this model because I liked the idea of not using the coffee reservoir as the ""bucket"" needed to fill the clean water reservoir. I thought it would keep the clean water container cleaner. HOWEVER. ever since I purchased this 6 months ago, we have had a problem with water pooling underneath the coffee reservoir, on either side of the hot plate.  I have been trying to find a solution for why it does this for quite a while, and today, I called Hamilton Beach to ask them how I could fix the problem. Apparently it is built to do this. ????????? ""that is why we created the two deep pockets next to the hot plate - to catch the water condensation. you need to dump it out every couple uses"".  That just doesn't seem the right way to make a product. Built to leak. They said that this particular model, with the water reservoir on the side,leaks like this, but the others don't.  I have never had a leaking problem in any of the other versions, so I have to believe them when they say its just this model. but, seriously? I will be getting something new soon. probably NOT a Hamilton Beach."
"August 20, 2018",Denise,3.0,,"When I find a replacement, I want to return this item.  You get what you pay for. Not much thought was put into the design of this coffee maker. I bought it because of the no carafe feature. But it's appeal stopped there. I'm going to list 1,2,3 less typing. 1. No light, can't see how full or not your cup is. 2. How much coffee is still in the reservoir? Unless you turn the whole unit to the side you can not see it. So, if it is empty the pot is still on and the heat plate is scorched. 3. The spill plate is not secured. So, constantly having to reposition it. I could list 4,5 but will stop here."
"February 4, 2017",C. Boyd,4.0,One,"Not nearly as good as the 12 year-old HB we replaced - filling with water can be tricky, the rubber feet on the bottom won't stay on (we have to slide this out from underneath a cabinet to fill it, so maybe it's only made to be stationary), and it won't stay still when we dispense coffee from it (again, some of the rubber feet have come off).  However, it makes good, hot coffee and keeps it that way without a glass carafe to deal with.  In my opinion, this style coffee maker produces better-tasting coffee than the cheap carafe models, so my only regret is that we couldn't buy the older model."
"December 1, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Love this! We spent years annoyed with Keurig and their options before deciding to go for another option. If you hate using a million k pods a month, or are overwhelmed refilling your reusable pods, or just settle within one cup to avoid the hassle then this pot is for you! It makes as small or large of a pot you want, keeps it warm for up to 4 hours, and you just push your cup onto the ""handle"" until full. Best morning routine purchase we've made, EVER! Also, I never figured out programming my Keurig but had this figured out day 2 after not realizing I had to set my program then turn it on."
"October 6, 2015",MJ,5.0,One,"So far so good.  I don't know why people are complaining about water making a mess with this machine.  I will upload a video to show you how it works soon. Pros: Makes good coffee Pours smooth from the dispenser Cleans easy No dripping Good options Cons: If I had to make one, I would say it is to small or have a slide lid.  Being nit picky here though. Update: Here is a video of water being poured into the reservoir. It's not difficult and I don't understand why people are rating this lower because of difficulty. Just pour the water controlled and to the side, no mess. Since I have had this machine, I replaced the top reservoir once because I started making tea and coffee via press. I use this machine to make hot water. It is perfect for my needs."
"February 7, 2020",Barb,5.0,,"For the life of me, I can't figure why anyone would give any less than 5 stars.  The Hamilton Beach coffee maker gives the best tasting cup of coffee if you take it out freshly brewed or have to wait a couple of hours to take it.  I wouldn't want any other brand of coffee maker or style (47900).  It is really easy to use and to clean."
"December 28, 2012",Michelle Light,5.0,One,"Well I was hesitant with so many negative reviews. But My SIL had one and when we went to visit her for the past 2 years, she was always using it. So I called and asked how she liked it, and how many she had bought. She said just the one, It has been great, and if it goes out, she is getting another just like it. So I decided to get one too. Very easy to use. I love that it has a cleaning indicator light. So you know when to clean it. (Just a water-vinegar solution, and you run it through the machine, then run plain water through a couple times after.) It also makes Iced coffee. Yes condensation does gather under the lid. Tapping it a couple times helps in the run off. Also I noticed that you do need to hold the cup level, against the back button in order to get it to come out fast. A light under where the coffee comes out would be nice, but isn't really necessary. Also we have used the warm cycle for 4 hours and the coffee still tastes fresh. It doesn't get bitter tasting. No complaints."
"May 23, 2020",Mark,3.0,,"I don't like to post a mediocre review but this coffee maker is work I don't mind a little work but this is too much work. It's very large to begin with so people should keep that in mind. From the splash of the coffee grounds onto where the water spouts out to the drips onto the base and the disassemble and reassemble just to make coffee it takes many steps to make coffee and then when done you have to do some serious cleaning. Honestly, I packed mine away and got a simple cheap one. I also had to dump the coffee out bc the coffee tasted like plastic. On the plus side it has a clock and you can set a timer for the coffee too and it has settings for med or bold taste etc"
"February 7, 2021",Carole H,5.0,,"This is my second purchase of this product.  I absolutely love this coffee maker.  My other one is 4 years old and was starting to lose its warmth, but I am keeping it for someone else.  All it takes is a reheat in the microwave.  I just felt like treating myself to a brand new machine."
"September 23, 2017",JLK,3.0,,"I had to look on Amazon to see how long i've had this: Two years. So, not too bad considering the price. However, after two years, the coffee comes out as a trickle. You'd think this would be an easy problem to fix: Clogged hole somewhere? Buildup? Nope. We can't figure it out to save our lives. So, it's cheap, it makes decent coffee. It's programable. But expect to replace it in two years or less. It also makes quite a big mess when you're filling the water and emptying the coffee grounds. Water drips everywhere. When I read that in someone else's review a few years ago I thought, ""C'mon. Who cares. Find something real to complain about."" But it really is annoying."
"January 23, 2017",Blondeinacamaro,5.0,,"Bought this  for my Husband ,as I don't drink coffee, but he wanted a coffee maker like this ,that dispense,s  by using only  a cup  and not a pot  the only thing I found wrong that broke off the first time,I placed on the counter was the little rubber feet ,one is forever lost and the other one won't stay on ,so,I left it off as it would be off balance with only  one .I'm sure their was a reason the manufacturer put these 2 rubber pieces on bottom ,but however doesn't take away from making  the coffee or the looks.All in all good coffee maker for the price ."
"May 20, 2016",hmbp,3.0,2,"Does the job and worth it for the convenience. My only complaint is that it makes a lot of noise even after it has finished brewing. It has a constant rumbling which is not a huge deal since eat in our dining room which is out of earshot of the coffeemaker, but if you have an eat-in kitchen I think this would be annoying. A nice add on would be a small LED light above the cup while you're filling it so you can see how much coffee you're putting in since the overhang of the brew container covers your cup, making it hard to see the coffee level. Other than that, controls and operation are easy and overall I'm happy."
"July 27, 2016",Nate,5.0,,"From all the coffee makers I've had in my life, this is by far my favorite. While the concept of brewing coffee has not really changed over the years this machine is innovative and fun. Easy to clean, don't have to touch the soggy filter when throwing it out in the thrash, and best of all NO DRIPS OR SPILLS!!! It is like at a fast food place getting a fountain drink and hot coffee comes out. Just top your cup off or pour a new cup. It has a bold feature and a warming setting that can be set from 1-4 hours. Completely programmable. The only thing I dislike about it is the the blue back light stays on all the time. It would be nice that it would turn the back light off after 30 seconds or something."
"December 26, 2020",mdcolliver,1.0,,"I have owned a Hamilton Beach coffee maker for years, when I had to replace my old one I bought this pot. Coffee runs down the front of it every time it's used. I contacted the company, they said it was the tank and sent me a knew one, nope it's not the tank just a bad design. Will never purchase again."
"November 14, 2014",Mono,4.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  It is the third Brewstation design we have owned.  We keep upgrading from the starter version to the better one eachas time. The best feature is ""no coffee pot"" and it dispenses right into your cup or mug.  The controls and operation are very simple and straight forward.  I also like how you can set the time for auto turn on and how many hours up to 4 after for auto shut off.  This is a fantastic feature for those couples that get up at different times or on a lazy Sunday when you want to grab a cup in the late morning.  There is also a feature called ""bold"" that actually does give the coffee a bolder, richer flavor, closer to a coffee house brand which I really like.  I hate weak coffee!  Overall, the fit and finish and design are solid.  We got about  2 or 3 years use each out of our former models, which I think is fair considering we used it every day and usually brew 10 to 12 cups at a time.  I think price to value is very good and I recommend getting the models with the extra features for just a few $$ more."
"July 5, 2016",hihatt2,5.0,,"I have this model at my home as well as my office.  I like that it doesn't require a glass pot than can break.  You take off the coffee filter basket and the top tank and simply fill this tank with water to the amount of cups you want to make (from 4 to 12) and pour the water into the bottom tank and put the top tank back on, add a filter and coffee to the basket, put it back and close the lid.  To ""pour"", after the coffee is brewed, push a cup against the bar in the middle and the coffee is dispensed directly into your cup.  It has worked well for me.  It is programmable to start automatically and also to keep coffee warm up to 4 hours.  I have had no problems with it."
"December 18, 2016",Michael S. Shelton,2.0,,"This is our fifth Hamilton Beach coffeemaker.  The quality is sliding downhill.  It looks attractive, but it's cheesy construction, and looks like it was made to be a toy, not a long-term kitchen appliance.  Surely this thing wasn't made in America.  The functionality and operation are OK, but lifting off the top support structure that holds the coffee filter / basket is painful because of a poor design of how to grasp the structure.  The drip tray doesn't have a solid fit and it's too small to allow a cup to sit on it.  Overall, it's the flimsiest and most poorly made HB product I've purchased.  I will think long and hard before buying another HB product."
"November 11, 2020",Joe Momma,2.0,,I tried this contraption yes contraption it made good coffee but the hassle to make the water container to pour water is awkward. Wear you put coffee in is awkward  design.also after 3 days of use it did not shut off after getting cup of coffee made a mess. you need to just spend the money an get a Bunn coffee maker
"March 24, 2013",C. Lambright,5.0,,"I read the reviews on this coffee maker before  buying it and was concerned about the reviews saying that it dripped, and that you can't fill a travel mug or an insulated coffee cup without spilling coffee all over the counter because  I use an insulated mug and my husband uses a travel mug.  But I liked the ""carafe-less"" feature, so decided to try it.  After two weeks of use, all I can say is ""bravo!""  The coffee is great and we have had NO problem filling my double-walled coffee mug and my husband's travel mug.  As for dripping, when you lift the lid to remove the basket and the reservoir, you do get some condensation that runs down the back of the coffee maker, but on the INSIDE, not the outside as one review said.  No problem, really....and if you tap the lid before you lift it, that helps.  My only negative comment is that it takes longer to brew a small amount of coffee than a traditional coffee maker with carafe.  But I guess I'm not as impatient, hurried, or stressed as many of the other reviewers because that's not a problem.  I would definitely recommend this product and hope ours will have a long life."
"April 1, 2021",Melanie White,1.0,,"After using for about 6 months the coffee from the coffees holding tank around the heating element. Call customer service and they say it because its dirty. Um no we cleaned it and its not the dispenser spout leaking its the holding tank. They are in total denial of this leaking. We have bought 4 and all 4 LEAK, or I should say coffee runs out of the maker as its brewing. Way too much money for a coffee pot that leaks coffee all over your counters and floor. I will never buy another Hamilton Beach product again. Absolute garbage and very poor customer service."
"December 12, 2013",tessaame,5.0,,"I just received my Brewstation Summit today.  It is amazing!!!  It was easy to set up, and to learn to use.  Just follow the directions.  I read review after review and finally decided to give it a try.  I can't understand why so many reviews are so critical.  The brewstation works great.  It keeps the coffee hot, the flavor of the coffee is excellent( I am a coffee snob and grind fresh coffee with every pot), there is no burn taste, and what is the issue people can't see the coffee filling the cup?  I am 63 years old and can see the contents going into the cup fine.  Sometimes people have too much time on their hands and have to complain.  If this brewstation last a short time or a long time, I will never go back to a standard coffee maker.  Oh yes, I have cleaned the brewstation, what is the big deal?  And no leaks. People need to be more positive.  This is a great unit for the price.  It is good looking as well as functional.  I am beyond pleased."
"September 16, 2020",Nanny,2.0,,"This is the 3rd one of these I've owned.  The first one was amazing and lasted over 2 years.  I make a lot of coffee so I was okay replacing it the first time.  The 2nd one I owned lasted barely a year.  It leaked everywhere.. on my counter down my cabinets.  I cleaned it and cleaned and replaced the piece that holds the coffee.  I tried one more time and ordered the 3rd one which lasted less than FOUR MONTHS... Leaked everywhere AGAIN.  I contacted everyone and was told it was ""out of warranty"".  So there you have it.  Out of luck after 4 months.  I give up.  This is ridiculous.  They obviously cheapened the construction parts.  I like this type of dispenser but I won't ever purchase another."
"November 11, 2020",Darrell Cain,1.0,,"At first I loved this coffee maker.  Worked great, looked awesome.  Then, as time goes by, the plastic lever that depresses the flow stop gets weaker and weaker until it is too weak to perform the way it was intended.  After 7 months it is time to find a new coffee maker.  This one is so close to being perfect except for the material it's made of.  Sorry, but i wouldn't buy this if your morning coffee is important."
"November 1, 2019",R G Shore,4.0,,This is our second one of these coffee makers.  We still have not figured out why the portion of the maker below the basket fills with water!  Over time the water collects in the voids and makes a mess.  We overlook this since the maker makes such good coffee and is reasonably priced.
"December 1, 2020",Paul Telesford,1.0,,"THIS UNIT IS NOT PACKAGED PROPERLY FOR SHIPPING.  IT COMES IN A FLIMSY BOX WITH SOFT CORRUGATED CARDBOARD ON THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM.  THERE IS NOTHING TO PROTECT IT DURING SHIPPING AND ""BAD"" HANDLING. SO RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX I NOTICED THAT THE DISPLAY WAS ""BLEEDING""  OF COURSE THIS RENDERS THE UNIT USELESS. I AM PEEVED THAT I HAVE TO GO THRU THE TROUBLE OF RETURNING SOMETHING THAT I REALLY WANTED BECAUSE IT WAS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ON HERE.  GO TO THE STORE AS IT IS AN EXCELLENT MACHINE.  I HAVE HAD ONE FOR YEARS BUT THE DISPENSER STOPPED WORKING, ITS STILL BREWS WONDERFULLY AND KEEPS HOT FOR HOURS."
"July 23, 2016",Lindsey R.,5.0,,"We bought this because we had only a french press and a keurig. My husband would take forever to make coffee in the morning with the french press and it never seemed to be enough coffee. I decided to get this one as a replacement and I'm so so happy I did! It's awesome! I love that you can just press your coffee cup into the dispenser and pour out as much as you need. I do small amounts at a time so it always stays hot. It keep coffee hot for up to 4 hours which is wonderful for people like me who drink coffee throughout the morning. It's easy to clean and takes me a minute to put water and coffee in in the morning so now I'm not waiting on my husband :) It has a nice ""bold"" setting which I find makes the coffee taste so much richer. It's wonderful and I only wish I'd have gotten it sooner!"
"September 27, 2019",Donna S.,2.0,,"If you buy a $35 coffeemaker, you get a $35 coffeemaker. This one was a loser for me. Parts did not fit snugly together so after the coffee brews, it continues to make brewing sounds....and will not stop!  Absolutely crazy making!  I can push the coffee reservoir back and it will stop. So clearly it was defective. It looks cheap and is cheaply made. I’ve never been a Hamilton Beach fan, but decided to take a chance. Won’t make that mistake again."
"June 8, 2020",Kindle Customer,2.0,,"Sounds like an efficient concept, the basin holding the coffee is a dual purpose bucket to fill the water reservoir...I hate this model. I was so excited to get it because the model before it was nice For several months until the water pump failed, and then when we replaced it the new one failed within a month. Every time in try to get a cup of coffee there’s a steam of coffee trickling down the machine resulting in a puddle underneath the coffeemaker. As I don’t plan to clean a mess every time we get a cup of coffee, I’m returning this messy machine ASAP. I only rated a 2 star because the concept has such great potential. I will not be buying these coffeemakers ever again."
"November 2, 2020",Tina Holmes,5.0,,"I waited a couple of weeks to write a review, just because the reviews are so mixed. I ran water through a few times in order to get rid of the plastic smell.  The coffee tastes great and the temperature of the coffee is 160 degrees first cup and 160 degrees 4 hrs later.  No leaking as per other reviews.  The programing is easy unlike my previous coffee maker. I’m pleasantly surprised.  The previous coffee maker was much more expensive and I loved it but it only lasted 2 years so if I get one year out of this one it’s worth it."
"June 5, 2020",L Jewkes,1.0,,"We bought this coffee maker to replace our original one which we had for years, but the bar that allows the coffee to be released into the cup would not work anymore.  We received the replacement unit and noticed that the unit's brewing cycle would not stop after the coffee brewed and the coffee was in the compartment that dispenses the coffee. It caused the coffee to remain too hot and the top of the unit was way too hot.  We felt that this is a fire hazard and we are returning the unit.  We contacted Hamilton Beach and they assured us that that was the way the product was supposed to work.  Well, the original did not work in this overheated manner and so we are reluctantly returning the unit."
"January 10, 2020",Craig Rickard,4.0,,"So far the Brewmaster works well but does have its shortcomings.  I believe that some, if not all, of these have been mentioned before.  First, one has to hold the coffee pot to keep it from sliding on the counter when dispensing coffee.  Second, lots of condensation develops inside the filter area after brewing.  Be prepared with a few paper towels when opening the lid.  Finally, it does drip some from the dispenser spout but it's manageable.  I guess that's to be expected with this style of coffee maker.  Hopefully a better system is in the pipeline."
"August 30, 2012",SammysCat,2.0,One,"I had to replace my two year old BrewStation Deluxe model 47455 because it kept leaking coffee from the coffee tank at the dispensing point. Thought I was upgrading to this new model 48464 but I don't consider this a betterment of the product. The lid is where the brewing water is pumped into so it can then spray down on the coffee grounds. Not all the water actually gets removed from the lid into the coffee and just sits there until the lid is opened and then it runs everwhere, including down into the electronics, over the sides, down the back. In order to minimize this I have to hold a towel over the back of the coffee maker to catch some but not by any means all the water. I would encourage Hamilton Beach to go back to the drawing board on this coffee maker and actually test it in the real world before putting it on the market. The concept is great.  It is so much easier to push the dispenser bar rather than lifting and pouring from a heavy caraft."
"January 21, 2016",Phoebe V.,3.0,,"Update (July, 2018): I am now frustrated by the pouring of the coffee into a mug. It spills and drips everywhere (see photo). Next time I buy a coffeemaker, I won't buy one like this... This coffeemaker works great, overall. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I had been excited about the ""warming"" feature (to reheat coffee later on), but it takes a long time to warm and does not actually get hot, so this was somewhat disappointing. Since it's usually just me drinking coffee at home during the weekday, I like how you can make a small amount of coffee and adjust the setting to ""1-4 cups"", though I don't actually know how much of a difference it would make if I didn't use that setting- either way, it's easy to make a small or large amount of coffee."
"January 7, 2019",Bianca,5.0,,"One of the best coffee machines we have purchased so far. It is easy to prepare coffee, and very simple to clean it (just remove the whole basket where the prepared coffee is stored). What I also loved about is that there is no jar to be holding and cleaning, your pour coffee right out from the machine. Fill out the water container is also easy as you can just take it to the sink if you don't want an intermediary container."
"November 24, 2020",Sixt8bird,1.0,One,This is the 3rd of the newest model I have had. Everything is way better than previous models but unfortunately HAMILTON BEACH. You fail bigtime. The coffee fills at the back of the cup and it spills down the back of the coffee pot while filling your cup. It ends up all over the counter. As I said this was a new design and it sucks aZZ!!! All 3 dripped!!!
"May 31, 2021",Eileen Vadeboncoeur,4.0,,A great coffee maker.  We had broken too many glass pots in the past so was looking for an alternative.  This fits the bill.  Convenient dispenser system. A fresh HOT cup every time.  Have used the convenient programming feature.  Coffee is ready when you get up!  Only drawbacks are the grounds splash up under the inside of the cover and has to be clean every use.  (We always make 12 cups).  A small light in the dispenser area would be great.
"October 12, 2016",CHB,5.0,2,"I've had this for a couple of months and really like it.  The modular way the pieces fit and work together is a great and workable design.  I love not having a glass carafe to worry about.  The method of filling it is very easy to use.  It is very good at keeping the coffee hot.  The only downside is that it is somewhat awkward to fill a large travel mug.  If the mug is tall, you have to tilt it in order to push the coffee release lever.  It can be difficult to monitor how full the mug is when doing this.  But even with this minor hassle, I am very happy with the machine."
"July 24, 2020",🇺🇸Hippie Redneck Chick🇺🇸,3.0,,"Thought a maker without an actual glass carafe would be ideal; was incorrect. Find it harder to pour water into water  reservoir without making a mess, difficult to push lever for dispensing coffee and can’t clean reservoir good enough. The bottom warmer in the “carafe” & the built in filter were “stained/burned” brown after 2nd use. It is slower than we are use to on brewing. Flavor is good, set up is easy & a nice looking appliance."
"August 6, 2014",Dr. Phil,1.0,2,"This 47950 BrewStation replaced an older BrewStation model which served us faithfully and flawlessly for nearly four years; we LOVED that machine.  This 47950 model is a huge disappointment.  After about 6-months water began leaking, during the brewing process, into the cavities around the heating element.  It started leaking slowly and now, 8-months after purchase, leaks over 3/4 cup of water during each brew cycle.  The machine must be unplugged and the base drained into the sink after each use.  If we forget to drain between brewings, the cavities around the heating element fill up and water runs all over the counter during the second brew cycle. We are ordering a model 48465 BrewStation to replace this disappointing, prematurely failed model 47950 BrewStation.  The model 48465 does not have the detachable side water reservoir and is of a design similar to the BrewStation we formerly enjoyed for such a long time.  This model 47950 has definite design flaws, quality problems, and should be removed from production. One expects an appliance to have more durability than an 8-month service life.  I gave this BrewStation model 47950 a 1-star rating only because I didn't have a zero star option."
"July 14, 2016",William Chann,5.0,,"I work in an office that has communal coffee pots. For a year I was subjected to drinking burnt tasting coffee before I decided to buy my own machine. This coffee maker is amazing. Its easy to use, convenient, and makes a great drip cup of coffee. Best of all is it will keep your coffee at the perfect temperature all day (you do have to turn it back on after 4 hours).  I will say that overall its construction seems a little cheap, but I have found this to be the case with almost every other coffee maker I have used. This coffee maker is ideal for an office. Whenever you want it you have fast hot coffee at the ready."
"February 9, 2020",Grammie,1.0,,"Overall, this coffee pot is a great idea.  It makes good coffee quickly enough and can be programmed to keep the coffee warm for one hour or more.  The problem we have had started last week (about six weeks after we started using it).  When leaving coffee in the pot (internal carafe) during the day, coffee leaks out onto the counter and also into the heatign element chamber.  It's concerning that the leak could ruin the countertop and the wood floor plus the coffee in the heating element chamber could be a fire hazard.  Of course the problem started after the period of time that we could have returned it so we are stuck."
"July 24, 2014",Carl S,4.0,One,"In terms of quality and performance it's about what I'd expect from a low-end coffee maker.  I've had it for a few months now.  It's easy to use, easy to clean and makes a decent cup of coffee.  I really like the idea of dispensing coffee right into my cup. The only very minor complaint I have is the coffee needs to sit for 5 minutes or so after brewing is complete to allow it to get nice and hot.  Aside from that, no complaints. On the pro side, even if the coffee is left heating for 2 or 3 hours this machine doesn't ""scorch"" or burn the coffee.  It tastes just as fresh after sitting for several hours as it does when first brewed.  That alone makes this coffee maker worthwhile and it's the only machine I've ever had that doesn't burn the coffee. Definitely recommended if you can't afford hundreds of dollars for a high-end machine."
"May 28, 2020",Don N.,2.0,,"I gave it one star for Easy to Use because it doesn't work well. Seemed like a neat idea, but didn't last long. After a few weeks, it began to stall: it would not brew all of the water. We cleaned it and that helped, but for awhile. If it worked well, it would bet five stars for Easy to Use."
"February 20, 2020",Sparky,3.0,,"After several months of daily use. The Program function has fried out. It doesn't even light up, nor work. I love the concept of not having a coffee pot but It looks as if I will need to purchase yet another coffee maker. 3 in 3 years. Yup, Made in China, gotta love it."
"April 26, 2015",dmalcolm,2.0,2,"This is our third Brewstation.  They seem to last 2 to 3 years then something happens and it's usually the dispensing valve will begin to leak.  On this one however, and after just a couple of months, the carafe started to leak.  A full carafe will leak down in a couple hours and it's not noticeable at first because it drains into the water reservoir.  I tightened the screws on the bottom to see if that would stop the leak but I don't know the result yet.  I just snugged the screws up, as they just go into plastic and I didn't want to strip the screw holes.  More later. Update #1: Test finished.  I slowed down the leak considerably but it still leaks.  Now I have to find another carafe. Update #2: New coffee tank $30.44.  I like these coffee makers but the quality and longevity is just not there.  Next time I'll try another brand."
"December 7, 2016",Florida Investor,2.0,,"I really wanted to like this coffee maker, but it's just very clearly cheap. The worst part: the coffee is NOT hot enough. After five minutes, it's simply warm, after ten minutes, it's luke warm. I didn't realize how much this mattered to me until I'd been using this for about a week and kept noticing I was trying to refill my cups to make them warmer. When you like a nice cup in the morning but can't sit and drink it all at once, the temperature really matters.  The machine itself is very lightweight and plastic, almost feels like it could fall over.  Conversely, the machine parts - where you have to fill water, etc. are clunky and not easy to handle (they are big, spill when you pour, etc), which is super annoying when it's 6:30 am and you just want your coffee. The timer works well, but maybe that process is part of the heating issue. If you need a second coffee maker for some reason and just want something cheap I guess this is OK. But, for your main coffee machine, if you use this everyday, definitely spend the extra money to get something better. I wish I had."
"June 10, 2021",R. Barber,1.0,,I've had this for 7 weeks and during week 6 started leaking awful. Followed all the cleaning instructions and it's still awful. I had one years ago and got about 5 years out of it before that one started leaking. I figured I needed new. So I bought a different brand. Guess I need to stay away from this one.
"December 27, 2019",Barbara Partridge NO,4.0,,We bought this Hamilton Beach coffee maker. Received fast. and coffee has a good flavor. Only 1 problem is that the front  right corner leaks you are getting your coffee. My husband puts paper towels beneath the coffee maker to soak up the coffee but we still have to change the towels every day because it is a dark  brown and have to clean the space where it sits. Over all I will buy one again.
"June 9, 2020",Marcia S. Weigle,5.0,,"I love this model and after 18 years, I bought the same one as a replacement. The old one was still working but was leaking a little around the pour valve. Probably just needed a small part. Great machine! I only cleaned it twice ever... If the bucket is rinsed properly, it stays very clean inside."
"May 4, 2021",Sam,1.0,One,I gave this to my mother for a birthday present.  She did not tell me it leaks and it has stained her counters.  Horrible!
"February 10, 2021",Anne Watermelon,1.0,,"Straight out of the box, I washed my brand new machine with hot soapy water. As a practice run, I put in an empty coffee filter, added cold water into the Reservoir, waited about 15 minutes and finally, pressed my coffee cup onto  the lever to release piping hot water into my eagerly awaiting mug. See video.  It leaked hot liquid all over the tray below and my kitchen counter . Every. Time. Unfortunately, the “return date” was five days ago. It’s been sitting in my garage for a month waiting for my old coffee maker to die, and it did, this morning. Warning to Amazon shoppers, there is an end date to returning stuff, even crappy stuff."
"April 18, 2014",MyFriendTait,5.0,One,"I purchased this unit after our old coffee maker finally died after 20 years of daily use.  I don't think this one will last that long but it does make really good coffee.  Yes, it needs to have something behind it when you are dispensing the coffee.  If you don't have it set up where it is against a backsplash then you need to put your hand behind it.  Yes, you can fill almost any cup with coffee.  We have not had a single problem filling any of the cups we have, including travel mugs.  The travel mugs will fit without having to tilt them if you remove the (removable) base under the dispenser. And YES, you CAN reheat the coffee.  There is no need to dump out the coffee and start a new pot to have hot coffee.  If you press and hold the On/Off button for 3 seconds the unit will heat up any coffee left in the dispenser.  This is stated clearly in the pamphlet that comes with the unit.  For the price I think this is an excellent coffee maker."
"June 18, 2019",Pat and Emily Cena,5.0,,"We bought this brand of coffeemaker 13 years ago and really liked the design--no carafe to clean.  That original model finally gave out so we replaced it with this one and it's a big improvement on what was already a very good coffeemaker.  This new version is easier to use because the water tank feeds into the machine by itself--no need to fill the tank and then pour it into the machine.  That makes the process faster and much less messy.  The dispenser is much faster as well, and the whole machine looks better than its predecessor.  Nice job, product engineers!"
"February 6, 2017",M. Day,3.0,,"I've enjoyed this coffee pot during the 6 months I've had it. But when I receive it one thing I immediately noticed that could potentially be problematic has come to fruition. The plastic bar that you press your cup into to get the coffee dispensed controls a cheap plastic compression mechanism, which now leaks. It leaks thru the plastic press bar then trickles down the front of the machine a significant amount. It's a shame because, other than this, I've enjoyed the machine. I believe I'll pay the extra and just get a Bunn."
"June 24, 2016",Dr. Siphu,5.0,One,"OK, I'm a coffee aficionado. That being said, I am a drinker, not a barista. However, I have dabbled at trying to make good coffee with so-so results. This is why I end up going to Starbucks almost daily. I decided to give this coffee machine a shot based on the reviews I read. Yes, I read the bad ones too, and I almost decided not to buy it based on those reviews. Boy, am I glad I ended up buying it! I figured that it's only $30 if I made a mistake. Turns out that this coffee maker is friggin awesome. I have never had a cup of coffee so great at home before. In fact, I stopped going to Starbucks because I can basically make the same cup at home. Although I'm not crazy about the plastic (Hamilton, if you're reading this, please make a stainless steel version), this unit far exceeded my expectations. I'm not sure why there are bad reviews, but I guess you can't please everyone. In my opinion, the bad reviews are way too technical and over-analyze the whole process. In the end, what matters is how the coffee tastes. Buy one. You won't be disappointed. No, I don't work for Hamilton Beach."
"December 9, 2020",Jeff Cornish,3.0,,"Nice looking machine with clean lines and a small footprint, and that's about the end of the positives of this coffee maker. Overly clumsy design to add water, oddly loud when brewing, and leaks constantly. Very unhappy with this coffee maker and deeply regret purchasing."
"December 26, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"Third one we have bought. Not one has lasted a full year as of yet. Love the no caraffe part but, tired of the repeat having to replace. This one has made it 11 months. Wow"
"August 11, 2016",John A,5.0,,"I use this mainly to make iced coffee, and it works excellently. It makes the coffee surprisingly fast, and the taste is quite good. I am going to use this in my dorm, and it will be a very convenient way to get my iced coffee in the morning without shelling out $4 for a drink from one of the coffee shops in campus. The directions recommend putting ice in the tank where the coffee pours, but I personally have found that it turns out better to make the coffee hot, then pour it into a cup or tumbler with an ample amount of ice. Make sure to make it double strength though so that the melting ice doesn't make the coffee too weak."
"November 3, 2018",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,"I loved how easy it is to use and clean.  It also made a good cup of coffee, but after about a week it started to leak from the dispenser.  At first it was just a little, now if I let the leftovers in the pot it leaks all over the counter top."
"November 8, 2020",Don,1.0,,This is  a great coffee maker for a few months and then over time it will leak.  I purchased it in March of this year and it just started leaking all over my counter.  Appears the constant expanding from the heated element touching the coffee has compromised the plastic seal on the sides causing it to leak.  It worked great for several months but unfortunately it doesn't last long.
"August 18, 2018",Hugo Serrano,5.0,One,"This is my all time favorite coffee maker so far in my life and I've tried several and different brewing methods. It brews quickly, is programmable and makes delicious coffee every time. I love making iced coffee in this! The dispenser is SO convenient! If you want to buy a reusable filter, I don't recommend buying the plastic and metal ones because I've ordered and bought several and none fit. I ended up buying a reusable Hemp coffee filter off Amazon and it's perfect!!! Don't waste your time and money and get the Hemp one!"
"November 10, 2011",Amazon Customer,2.0,2,"I have to say the advertising, even on the box, is not true. This was a big disappointment. All I was looking for was a coffee maker that could keep coffee hot for a reasonable time without that scorched taste. So, I guess it is back to using the carafe style coffee maker I've been using for the last 10 years. The claims: Insulated Reservoir. What a laugh. The reservoir, which holds the hot coffee, is thin plastic. I have to admit it is two layers of very thin plastic separated by about a sixteenth of an inch of air space. You have to really look to see that it isn't just a single layer of thin platic. Once the heating element shuts off, it goes cold in about a half hour. Seriously, your coffee will stay hot in a cup for about as long. Gentle heater. Yeah, right. The box says ""...maintain coffee's temperature -no hot plate to scorch coffee flavor."" You can set what is essentially an internal hot plate to stay on for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours after the coffee is brewed. You can actually see the internal hot plate boiling the coffee around it. I have tried setting the coffee maker to even one hour of heating. It's no use, you will have that nasty, scorched taste at even one hour. So, you have a coffee maker that will scorch your coffee in less than an hour and keep it cold the rest of the day. What a deal! I give it two stars because it does do one of the three things it claims to do: it dispenses coffee. By the way, forget about trying to use Styrofoam cups with this thing. You need something very rigid to press against the dispenser bar."
"December 1, 2020",Randy Parcel,3.0,,"My wife and I owned two models of BrewStation for more than a decade, so we expected the quality to be the same when buying a replacement. Unfortunately, our expectations were let down when I took it out of the box today and brewed the first pot. The latest model dribbles coffee down the side of the unit whenever I dispense, which didn't start happening until YEARS of using the previous model. This flaw destroys every ounce of enjoyment I get from what is usually a pleasant experience. I'm not very confident that replacing parts will bring us better results. Depending on how their customer service department handles the situation, they may have lost a customer. Disappointing to say the least."
"November 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"See my attached video - when you press the dispenser actuator, a second “unauthorized stream” dribbles down the back of your cup. I sent back the first one thinking I just got a defective unit and whaddya know the replacement one did the same damn thing. Tried tightening screws and whatnot but it still leaks. Sent back the second too and got a Cuisinart DCC-3000."
"January 31, 2014",Deborah Collins,2.0,,"I really like the coffee maker, in fact this is the second one I bought.  It's for the lake house.  I solved the bubbling noise problem by putting a thin metal washer on the metal heating plate.  Noise gone.  The coffee has always been hot enough for me.  The problem arose when the coffee maker arrived with the small plastic drip catcher broken.  I called customer service and gave them all the numbers from the bottom of the machine and other information they wanted.  They said I had to send a receipt.  Amazon didn't't send a paper receipt so I sent a copy of the electronic one.  After a few days they responded that they couldn't open the link.  I gave them all the information on the receipt.  We went back and forth about it but they refused to send the part without a receipt.  Did they really think I was asking for this if I didn't have the machine?  Would it kill them to send the part that couldn't cost more than a few cents?  It seems more important to them to stick to their rigid policies than to please a customer.  Just so you know!"
"August 22, 2013",BF,4.0,One,"It pretty much works as it should. We haven't had any issues like some of the other reviews mentioned. No leaks or anything like that. The only downside is that the warming plate serves to ""boil"" the coffee. My husband got up and made 2 travel mugs of coffee (6 cups on the machine.) and set it to the 4 hour warming setting. By the time I was up and pouring my coffee it had reduced by about half. It was still hot, he knows he measured correctly but the warming function kind of boiled it away. Surprisingly there was no scorched or gross burnt taste given the heat. So that was good. I also find that the ""BOLD"" option on brewing doesn't do a whole lot, whereas our previous BrewStation's BOLD setting really made it a bold flavor. Not a dealbreaker for us but a bit disappointing, nonetheless. Hubby doesn't like the reservoir for water on the side, but I love it. The older model was a pain to fill, pour and have to put the whole thing back together. For me, the side reservoir is great. The iced coffee option is great. I've used that quite a bit and it works very well. Overall, I'd say it's a decent coffee maker although not as good as our previous BrewStation model that was discontinued."
"July 4, 2018",Marc C.,2.0,One,"This does the job OK and I liked this machine at first- but eventually having to tilt the thing to get at that last bit of coffee to be dispensed is a pain in the butt, and if you have an odd shaped mug or to go mug good luck getting it to dispense easily. In addition, the burner directly touching the coffee is a huge problem. If you let coffee sit for more than 15 minutes is has a noticeable burned coffee taste. Mine also never worked correctly with the “keep warm” feature- if you turned on the machine that burner stayed on until you unplugged it. It also has a huge clearance so it doesn’t fit under most countertops. Unless you are extremely lazy and can’t use a carafe, I’d advise you look elsewhere for your coffee making needs."
"January 29, 2020",Big AL,4.0,,"It's supposed to be a 12 cup capacity. A cup is equal to 8oz. I can only add 60 ounces of water to the resivor (and that's top off) which means it is not a 12 cup coffee maker. Its only an 7 1/2 cup coffee maker. False information in description about capacity. Also you need to clean the heating element (physical scrub it) inside the coffee storage area, ever 4 or 5 days, that's a bit often. Overall it is pretty good. I would recommend trying a different one with a true capacity if you drink coffee like me, all day. Thanks"
"June 28, 2021",Jacki,2.0,,"This machine was great for the first month. Coffee was delicious,  it stayed hot for up to 4 hours and it was easy to use. After a approximately a month of every day use, it started leaking everywhere,  everytime. I tried all the suggestions on how to stop it, including cleaning the machine, to no avail. I had to buy another brand coffee maker to avoid a mess every day."
"January 31, 2019",Marilyn Goodman,3.0,One,"I originally chose this because I wanted to avoid a breakable glass carafe.  The coffee it makes is fine, but I find it impossible to clean sufficiently.  The coffee reservoir, which can't be submerged, has many uneven areas that can't be scrubbed with any tool.  I have tried soaking it with detergent, vinegar, bleach.  Nothing removes the coffee residue."
"March 15, 2017",J. Boyle,2.0,,"I bought this coffee maker in part based on the explicit claims in the product description that the parts were dishwasher safe.  Even the ""manufactured supplied"" section on the Amazon site says that the coffee reservoir is dishwasher safe.  However, when it arrived, the included printed user guide says do NOT ever put the reservoir in the dishwasher.  I called Hamilton Beach and the agent (who seemed very professional and polite, by the way) confirmed that it is NOT dishwasher safe.  She said the HB website makes no such claim and that she was sorrry, but that HB can't control what goes on the Amazon website.  I made sure she knew it was in the ""manufacturer supplied"" section, but she couldn't explain the discrepancy.  I'm returning it unused."
"August 2, 2019",Kitchen girl,4.0,,"I had this brew station years ago, switched to the coffee maker.  I bought it again, & have noticed when i pull it away from the back of the counter, to fill it, there is coffee under it, staining the counter.  It does it every time, i have to wipe up the mess.  Also, while filling my mug, coffee runs down the maker into the drip tray.  I have held my mug in there several ways, some always runs down to the drip tray.  I do love the convenience of filling your mug, versus the coffee carafe.  When i dies, i probably won't purchase it again, was disappointed, had always trusted Hamilton Beach products. :o("
"January 11, 2015",DebG,3.0,,"I have had this coffeemaker for a little over a year. In that time it worked well and produced a good cup of coffee.  But suddenly the unit started making a lot of noise when brewing, creating a lot of steam and taking forever to brew a pot.  I followed directions for cleaning the unit, like I have done consistently throughout the year.  ( A cleaning message flashes when it is time).  Even though I cleaned it twice, the clean light keeps flashing and the quality of the coffee has gone down considerably.  I almost feel like the unit is over-heating and scorching the coffee.  In the past my coffee makers have lasted for years, but I feel this one is becoming more unreliable after just one year.  I just broke down and ordered a more basic Mr Coffee to replace this unit.  I am not happy with the life of the unit at all."
"May 29, 2019",Ian,5.0,,"Got this because I wanted something to make the coffee for me (a timer). I was going to buy a less expensive Hamilton but this caught my eye, mostly because it said it would make iced coffee. I haven’t had a bad cup since I got it, iced is great too. The 46310 is great if you don’t want to spring for this one. Update: after a little more than a year the heater doesn’t work as well as when new. Keeps coffee Luke warm at best."
"November 6, 2015",Nikta222,1.0,2,"I've been a big fan of the Hamilton Beach coffee dispensers for awhile. But unfortunately they don't make them like they used to. I had one last for 7 or 8 years before it died, and I had to go with a newer model. TWICE. This model was the first of two. Both of them lasted less than a year before crapping out, and we cleaned them daily, and deep-cleaned/descaled every few months. Both times, it would stop brewing before using up all the water in the tank, and sound like galloping horses by the end of the cycle. At long last, I think I have to move to a different brand."
"March 22, 2020",Alfred K. Hicks,2.0,,"I bought this unit and thought it would work well for us and our coffee, but I was wrong.  It wasn't expensive, but the darn thing leaks coffee all over the place. I have bought coffee makers before and this one by far was the worst one yet. I would not recommend this unit"
"April 12, 2021",Charles D. Collier,5.0,,My first one was about 10 years old and got to where the dispensing valve let the coffee drip down behind the fascia missing the drip tray. So I decided I needed a new one. This version is cosmetically updated from my earlier one and is still a great coffee maker.
"September 17, 2020",Allison,2.0,,Font buy this one I have had it for 6 months and now the delay brew works but the coffee maker makes coffee anytime you put water in the resorvior doesn't even have to press the on button.  add water it makes coffee set the delay brew and add coffee and water It makes coffee.  The oON button is not even lit and it makes coffee It also feels like the warmer is never turning off. I have unplugged it because at this point it is a fire hazard - I have purchased another one for our RV now I wonder how long that one will actually work
"December 9, 2016",John J,5.0,,"True to its name and even though there is a newer model; I've used this brand and type before. I had one from 2008-2012 which worked perfectly; then put it up for one of those trendy by the cup pod machines costing hundreds. I went through 4 of those in three years; fortunately, the establishment where purchased had a generous refund policy. The 2008 model was lost in a move (or I would still be using it), and so I returned back to this type and brand this year. A word of caution; if you grind your own coffee too finely, some of the microscopic grinds will pass through the filter and eventually clog the dispenser; and it's a task to clean. With brand-name ground coffee, or more coarsely ground home coffee there will be no issue."
"February 21, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"This coffee pot is awful! We have had it for less than a year and it’s already broken! Something inside is broken and it won’t hold the coffee in the tank. Walked out to find coffee all over my kitchen floor. On top of it not holding coffee in the tank now, it also won’t keep the coffee hot. Not even 15 minutes after  it was brewed the other day, the coffee was room temp at best. So disappointed!"
"November 5, 2019",William J Pepicello,4.0,,"This product  eliminates the need for messy carafes.  It also eliminates the need top pour water into the unit, as it has a simple container that fees water into the brewer. It keeps coffee warm as long as I want.  In short, it takes care of my biggest gripes with other coffee makers.  It makes my morning coffee easy and delicious.  The only issue I have is that it is a bit noisy because it boils the coffee while it is in the keep warm mode. But it is by far the best coffee maker I have ever used."
"June 22, 2020",TERRA,2.0,,"Bought this in Feb 2019, we use this on an average of only 3-4 times a week. A year later this had started leaking & I tried cleaning, vinegar cleaning, to see if something was getting in the way of it from closing. Really wished it had lasted longer,  Hamilton Beach has always been good for us. I will say,  I do wish it was taller to allow travel mugs to fully fit underneath."
"October 2, 2019",Heather ❤️,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker. This is my third one in the last 10 years. No burnt coffee,  no decanter to have to worry about breaking and easy to use and clean.  Love the programmable feature and being able to wake up to hot fresh brewed coffee. And it keeps your coffee hot for four hours."
"October 9, 2016",Tammy Tucker,4.0,One,"Love this coffee maker so much that this is the 2nd one for me. My first one was the one that had more of the brushed silver on it. It lasted several years but then finally conked out. So, I bought this one. My favorite thing about it is that there's no carafe and you can make a full pot of coffee or a little amount of coffee (you're not limited to 1-2 cups like lots of other no carafe coffee makers). It does seem like you're limited as far as colors. My mom wanted one but needed it in white, and we could NOT find one."
"June 16, 2021",Jana,1.0,,I'm hoping mine is defective and not all have this many issues and are insanely loud. The on/program lights are very bright and illuminate my entire kitchen. After a few months it started leaking water from the bottom and I ended up throwing it out and buying a different model.
"July 3, 2020",Gwen S.,2.0,,"From the first time I used it, the timer doesn't work that's supposed to start the coffee in the morning and it leaks from the dispenser when pushed to get coffee. I've bought this brand many times over the last 15 years and never had problems like this. This model #48465 was suppose to be better than the last one #48464. No, it's just as bad."
"January 14, 2020",Lynn W,2.0,,"I initially really liked this coffee maker. But I realized that the coffee was brewed, then being held and heated in plastic versus a glass pot. It made noises that indicated it was practically boiling. I think that is unhealthy. I replaced this with a traditional coffee maker."
"July 16, 2014",D. Florio,5.0,,"A great coffee machine! Water is easily poured into reservoir from tank with a minimum of dribbles. Programming is relatively hassle free & the price is great.  We've had other brands like Mr. Coffee and I was thankful when it broke.  I was looking all over for another one like this from Hamilton Beach as we had owned a similar model years ago but is was broken when dropped by the movers when we relocated.  Walmart had the exact same model priced $10 more than this, but the box had been opened & I was leary about buying a previously opened item. I quickly checked the mobile Amazon app & saw it available.  I was happy to have found it. It has some cool features like ""extra strong & iced"". I would buy it again in a heartbeat should this one meet some unfortunate end."
"March 23, 2017",Tabum,4.0,2,"I'm giving 4 stars because I previously had this coffee station and it worked perfect for 4 years.  The one I received had debris all over it out of the box.  I cleaned it up and was running water/no coffee through to clean it before using and I realized the right side of the blue display was pulled away from the plastic.  I checked all of the buttons and the right side buttons were loose. Tried to do a replacement but feature could not locate my card, so I am returning it.  Am ordering another one...hope this was just a fluke."
"May 8, 2021",Debbie,1.0,,I used it 3 days and the 2nd day starting leaking coffee down to tray.  Had my first brewstation do long I could not get any replacement parts.  This one I would like to replace right away.  But paid enough money for it. So I use a napkin on top of tray...pretty sad.
"February 24, 2021",Desarae Orgo,1.0,,Bought this coffee maker less than a year ago and I just chucked it in the garbage.... because that’s where it belongs. This coffee maker leaked over and over again no matter what I did. I cleaned it with vinegar (as instructed on their website) and I allowed water to flow through the lever (also instructed on their website). This thing leaked so bad my counter tops and cabinets are destroyed. Spend a little more money for a better quality because you obviously get what you pay for!
"March 23, 2020",Pete the Cat,1.0,,"This was the second time we purchased this coffee maker. It was fantastic. Was until we found out the bottom of the carafes plastic was peeling off. What likely leached into our coffee we will never know. This didn’t happen with our first model. Not sure how to contact seller for support, but I hope this helps."
"March 29, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"LOVE!! I’ve used it mostly for its ice coffee making capability and it’s amazing. Even though you put ice in the machine, it somehow manages to not create watered down tasting ice coffee. It comes out strong. It’s very easy to put together, to clean and to use. I love how the coffee sits in the compartment above and is kept warm or cold.  My sister turned me onto this coffee maker and I’m so glad that she did. Absolutely LOVE. You won’t regret this purchase."
"February 16, 2016",Joe E. Lepo,5.0,One,"I've bought of few of these over several years for friends and relatives, and I have used mine for well over 5 years. This coffee maker is so superior to coffee makers with separate glass carafes. How many times I've had to replace broken carafes and always have that extra motion of pouring the coffee into the cup. The Hamilton Beach system is and so easy to program and use. Just put your cup underneath and get fresh delicious hot coffee. At 6 a.m. this is luxury. I periodically clean the valve area to keep it flowing freely, but this is a 5 minute task maybe done every few months."
"June 12, 2014",nina,5.0,,"I love this coffeemaker.  I had one from my MIL for several years and discovered a science fair project (looked like sewage, YUCK!) a few months ago.  My old one was not able to be cleaned in the water well area well at all, though I tried, but once I got the flash light out...I chucked it in the garbage.  This lead to my search for a coffee maker with 2 requirements 1) It needed a dispenser, no pot and 2) able to be cleaned easily.  I looked high and low and I found this one.  I really like it.  It has the somewhat weak construction (seems a little weak where you attach the water well) assumed for this brand and price, but all the pieces come apart and can be cleaned to avoid the river sludge of my past brewer. It has a timer I have finally started using and also a timed warming base so you can set it for 1+ hours. Great buy for me, if I get a couple years out of it I will be happy (my last one was Hamilton Beach and lasted about 10 years)."
"March 27, 2021",ellen roberts,1.0,,This is my 3rd coffee maker in this Hamilton Beach model.  I have enjoyed mine at home for at least 15 years.  I also bought my parents one.  I had to replace mine at home and I am very disappointed in the current model I received.  It is flimsy plastic and not half as sturdy as mine that I have owned before!  I’m very disappointed with the cheap materials used to make it.  I will not ever buy another and I would not recommend it.
"December 27, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is the second Hamilton Beach coffee brewer I have had. I love it!! You can leave it turned on for four hours and the coffee still tastes fresh brewed. My first one only lasted two years and it started leaking. I can overlook that for the money I saved as I didn't throw out leftover coffee. I would recommend this to my friends!!
"December 31, 2019",Irish Lass,3.0,,I am disappointed in the coffee maker. The heating element is too strong and Cooks the coffee directly. I thought it was more of a carafe holding the coffee warm but no it's cooking the coffee so it's quite bitter. There is no light underneath the dispenser so if you're trying to grab a coffee without turning your lights on watch out for spillage.
"February 24, 2016",Ross,3.0,One,"Here is what I like - the separate tank is a plus.  I like the dispenser vs. using a carafe.  Makes good coffee.  Not that hard to clean. Here is what is wrong - the lid to the tank broke very easily soon after I got this.  (the hinges).  Cheaply made.  The design also allows water to accumulate around the heating element after each pot is made.  Eventually you have to dump out this whole thing or water starts to leak all over your counter.  It did this from the beginning.  Most recently, it sprang some other leak - not of brewed coffee, but somewhere along the tank-to-heating element cycle.  I'm getting a new machine and will donate this to goodwill."
"May 13, 2020",BEE,1.0,,"NEW REVIEW less stars AFTER ONLY 5 WEEKS OF USAGE - I noticed black goo underneath the brew station, upon inspection I noticed the basket reservoir is seeping into the coffee maker where the reservoir rests and the well was filled with black goo where the basket is leaking. BEGINNING TO THINK THIS PRODUCT WAS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY sticker says one hand - only 2 of the 4 legs have rubber pads and the coffee pots slides.  have to hold the coffee pot in place in order to push cup to get coffee.  maybe mine is just defective but it is frustrating"
"February 6, 2019",Rick,1.0,,"This is the worst coffee maker  I have ever owned. Several issues. The cup always slips off the push lever to pour the coffee. It has this hard plastic ridge that the cup clips on. The plate at the bottom is too small to hold your cup.  The on button has this rubber in it that started peeling off. The Hamilton Beach lettering started wearing off so it looks crappy. Yiu can never tell how much coffee is left because after just one use the indicator has coffee residue on it. If you run out of coffee and don't realize it, after o ly a fre minutes any little bit of coffee burns on the plate really bad. And, it takes forever for this coffeemaker to brew a cup of coffee. The reservoir always looks crooked because it leans out. And its noisy, even when it's done brewing, it continues to make a noise. On the upside, it does keep the coffee hot, but the coffee tastes old pretty quick."
"November 27, 2017",Bean,4.0,2,"We have had a few of these over about a 15 yr period, along with other coffee makers but I like the fact that you can pull off the container on the side and fill it up, the biggest downside to the unit is under the pot between the heating element there are two reservoir's that fill with condensate that you have to soak up with a washcloth or something daily, if you forget you will have a huge wet mess everywhere, but the pot always makes a perfect cup every time!"
"June 11, 2021",Christina Jones,1.0,,"The flavor, timer and usage is great. But no matter what cup I try I put up against the button and it LEAKS ALL OVER so I have to hold a wash cloth at the bottom of cup while trying to dispense my hot coffee. I I’ll be tossing in the trash because it is past my return policy."
"February 9, 2014",Elaine M,5.0,,"I purchased the Hamilton Beach Brewstation at a local store but a different model, and when I opened it and saw how wide it was I was very disappointed since it just did not look good sitting on my kitchen counter taking a lot of space up so I returned it.  After looking on Amazon at the different models I purchased this model, took it out and placed it on my counter but it did not fit underneath my cabinets, Amazon's measurements were not accurate.  But I found a spot for it and honestly I rated this a 5 star, it is great easy to use coffee taste great and I love placing my cup pushing the bar and getting a fresh cup of coffee instantly.  Also no carafe to break or stain anymore.  I read some of the ratings and was uneasy about buying this some rated a lot of spilling or water on counter.  I don't find that at all.  When you pour your water in I use a pitcher with a spout and also when you push your cup against that bar, there is more then enough room for the coffee to pour into your cup, never misses!  Great buy I would recommend without any hesitation!"
"March 18, 2020",The Music Doctor,2.0,,"Seemed like a good idea. It seemed like a cool new option.  I had always had the regular Mr. Coffee drip maker.  This unit worked OK for a while, then I realized that about every 3rd batch tasted like crap.  then I realized that it was leaking internally and leaving a black gummy mess underneath the unit.  WTF?  I dealt with it for a couple months, then threw it away (after only 4 months).  Went back to the regular 12 cup Mr Coffee.  Couldn't be happier now."
"October 17, 2020",Karen,1.0,,"This is the second coffee maker in this model that leaks.  In July we exchanged the first one purchased in June for our RV because it leaked, and our bad we didn't try it out before camping again in Oct. only to discover it leaks as well, and now the return window is closed. The leak is around the dispenser above the button to push to fill your cup.  Runs down the front into the catch basin and makes a big mess.  Have to use paper towels to catch the leaks when filling our cups. This is so disappointing as we owned this same model of coffee maker for many, many years and never had a problem with it until it died."
"April 28, 2021",Shannon Cooper,1.0,,"We used the coffee pot for the very first time and left for work. What coffee was left in the reservoir leaked thru the downspout all over my counter. It was flooded with coffee when I got home. Apparently we have to drain all coffee from the reservoir each morning so it doesnt flood our countertops. Not happy. Aside from that, its a nice looking coffee pot but super bummed out."
"July 14, 2016",MS,4.0,,"We love this coffee maker! It is easy to use and clear instructions are included. Easy to clean also, which helps. It is nice that the water/coffee is all kept inside the machine and you just fill your cup below. It is tall enough to fill a travel mug. The one thing I wish it had that it doesn't is a light where you fill your mug. Our machine is kept in a dark corner and there is no sound when the coffee is coming out and you can't really see into the mug, so one day my husband overfilled his mug and we had coffee all over the counter."
"January 3, 2020",EJ,4.0,,"Easy to use. Works well. Good use a light in the area of where the coffee streams out into the cup. Beware that when you do push your cup to get coffee, the machine moves unless already against a wall. Simply to clean, easy to set time and timers. Overall a very good buy if you compare it to the Cuisinart one which costs an extra $30 and doesn't have a light either."
"November 25, 2020",s,3.0,,"If the coffee flavor is good, and keeps the coffee warm, then what's the problem? I love the fact that I brew several cups of coffee at once, but can pour one cup of coffee at a time. Unfortunately, every time that you do this , it leaks...and leaks...and leaks- all over the counter and with each cup of coffee. I do not understand why Hamilton Beach does not address this short coming.  My only conclusion is a flaw in a design that they choose not to support. This would be a great product if the leaking was fixed."
"December 11, 2020",HB,1.0,,"This was my third time trying this coffee maker.  The two prior ones started leaking after a few months.  Big mess, not worth the trouble.  Decided to give it one more try and purchased another one which was damaged in delivery.  Secured a refund and will now buy another brand."
"January 9, 2013",Morgan County,5.0,,"I have used the Hamilton Beach brew station for years.  I love that the coffee never tastes burned and you are not dealing with a glass container. My previous problem with this coffee maker was that it did not have the cup calibrations inside the water tank.  I fill the water tank with my kitchen sink faucel spray and I often make more coffee before the previous batch is completely gone.  For this reason I need the calibration inside the tank and with this model, after years of guessing, they finally have it. Now, my only complaint is that you can not turn it on once the stay warm time is done.  My husband accidently shut it off and couldn't get it back on.  It won't let you do this unless you make more coffee.  I have had to trick it by adding a cup of water to get it to  turn on.  I do not see a reason for this.  It's probably some safety feature for stupid people who probably shouldn't be operating this kind of complicated machinery anyway. But all in all, I love this product and this model has many improvements over  previously years."
"June 15, 2020",Marta,3.0,,I love the look it's very nice looking. Love the metal carafe that won't break. Coffee tastes great. But don't like that it doesn't stay on to keep coffee warm. After first cup. We have to put coffee in microwave each time we serve it. Not hot enough. It would be perfect if it stayed on to keep coffee hot.
"December 6, 2020",Ramona Gutierrez,1.0,,I have owned 3 of these machines in the last few years and they are great but unfortunately end with the same result. I give 1 star because the machines last maybe 3-4 months before they start leaking from the heating plate. The rubber molding underneath the heating plate does not hold up well and causes the coffee to seep through making a big mess everywhere. Again I have owned 3 of these with the same result. The last one I bought was at a store a month ago and I just threw that one away 2 days ago due to the same problem. I will no longer buy them as they should last longer for the price they are charging!
"November 29, 2020",Bradley D Steele,4.0,,"This purchase was to replace an older Hamilton Beach model we had for 15+ years. The quality of the coffee made is the same between the old and new models. I don't like how you can easily bump the time buttons and accidentally change the time. Not good when you use the timer. Another thing we noticed is at the end of filling a cup, the nozzle drips and runs down the back panel. I have it propped up in the back 1/4"" and the last bits now drip in the cup. These were not issues with our old model.  If these 2 items were not issues, I would have given 5 stars all around. I would recommend this product."
"March 9, 2020",L. Davidson,2.0,,We always purchased Hamilton Beach products. This coffee pot was a disappointment. First day to try it and it leaked really bad. We emptied it and looked closely to make sure we removed all tape from shipping. We didn’t find any thing. Tried once more and again it made a huge mess. We put it back in the box and I went online to order a different one.
"January 6, 2018",Amber,5.0,3,"I love this coffee maker because it can be taken apart and rinsed each day, without unplugging the coffee maker and bringing to the sink to clean out. My previous coffee maker had crevices, and was very difficult to clean. That nastiness ended up in our coffee, so I went with the Hamilton Beach dispenser type. We really love it, but be cautious about leaving it on when the coffee reaches a certain level, as it will burn on the metal heating element."
"September 30, 2013",Scott and Anna Olson,3.0,,"There are a lot of reviews on this coffee maker so I don't feel I need to say much.  It's an okay machine in that it makes good tasting coffee.  It's programmable and has nice features like a bold setting.  The clock is easy to read.  You can easily refill your cup with the press of a button.  However, I don't think I'd recommend it to others because of two things.  First of all, I don't like the main section of the maker - where the brewed coffee is stored.  It's not easy to pour water out of it into the actual machine and it's not easy to clean that section either.  It's just awkwardly shaped.  Second of all, the coffee maker just doesn't make very hot coffee.  It's barely steaming after I add a couple teaspoons of creamer.  I like hot coffee - not lukewarm coffee.  So... in summary, the machine works well enough but I can't recommend it for the previously mentioned reasons. I bought the Hamilton Beach 80675 Gold Tone Filter to use with this machine and it fits perfectly.  That, I like.  :)"
"September 5, 2018",Rhod Enlund,5.0,,"There is nothing i don't like about this machine. Perfect coffee, the 4 hr that keeps it hot is great for someone who drinks it all day. It also is great if you want to have iced coffee. You can program it so when it stops brewing, it shuts it self off. It does help if you put a small piece of foam under it as it has a tendency to move when you dispense."
"November 13, 2019",Mom,2.0,,"This is a replacement item, same make/model, but at least a 15 year upgrade.  We loved our previous Hamilton Beach self-serve coffee maker.  This newer version is TOO NOISY, it seem to constantly search and gurgle for water for a couple hours after it's made coffee.  And just recently, coffee is tasting burned.  The coffee maker doesn't turn off after the 4 hour setting which is scary.  It also doesn't make a full 12 cups as our previous coffee maker.  The only positive thing I can say is it's a nice design and it's easy to clean."
"March 27, 2016",Moogie,5.0,,"Every good thing everyone said is true! We got tired of making individual cups with the Keurig & washing out the reusable filter. It was fine before hubby retired. So I got this Hamilton Beach for his birthday along with a gold mesh filter. It makes great coffee on the bold setting, keeps it very warm up to 4 hours without producing a burnt taste & all the pieces are engineered well. The pouring spout doesn't dribble, all parts fit well together. It even has an opening in the back in case you overfill the reservoir, which I so cleaverly found the first time I made a pot! Recommended!"
"February 1, 2021",gina ianacone,2.0,,I should have taken a before and after This thing leaks like a sieve when getting your coffee The coffee comes out from the area where you rest your cup and then flows down all over the place What a mess No other brand carries this style or I This would have been sent back the next day
"February 17, 2018",SuZee,3.0,One,"Update....Customer service is shipping me a new one. She said to cut off the cord and throw the old one away.  Well, that is nice, but since they weren't open on Saturday, we went out and bought another brand at Walmart.  Will keep the new one for a spare I guess. Well, we got this on Jan 7 and today it would not work at all. Face lights up.  Will not turn off unless you unplug it.  Nothing. Feb 19.  Junk.  On hold for product support forever.  Junk. .."
"March 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Love it, my favorite coffee maker,easy to set up and get my coffee in the morning,,,that was good whileit lasted,,,,now the automatic timer wont work and thats important to me,,,,,for all the money i spent,,,this wasnt a very good coffee pot compared to others i've bought"
"February 28, 2020",liz w.,1.0,,I've been using this coffee pot for three months now. Three months to many it went in the trash can this morning. It's difficult to fill very awkward. Takes it forever to make a pot of coffee. There is always coffee dribbling out down the front of it. I don't know where it comes from but there is always a big puddle ( at least 1/2 cup) of coffee under the pot. You don't want this one!
"August 24, 2016",Irene Morin,5.0,,Hello my peeps the reason I purchased  and gave this coffee maker 5 stars is because the mechanical working is FANTASTIC  and my clients love coffee and sweets  early in the morning . However let me warn you if you purchase be prepared to chase the coffee maker across the table/counter (IT SLIDES) to get a cup of coffee . I do not know what  the problem is I have tried everything from putting towels underneath to backing it against the wall ( NO AVAIL ). The only solution I came up WITH ( SHORT FROM GLUING IT DOWN !!! ) is to hold it in place at the back end of the coffee maker but do it quickly it get hot back there. With a heavy heart I had to return it do to its slipping and sliding I am  afraid  it will tip over somehow  tip over and cause a sever burn . CONCLUSION : THIS COFFEE POT  IS A DANGER TO MY CLIENTS AND SELF !!!!!!!!.
"July 16, 2016",Sandee B,5.0,3,"Love it.  Works great.  Keeps coffee warm for up to 4 hours (or your choice up to 4 hours), has a side part where you put in water (this is an improvement over earlier models), has a nice spout where the coffee comes out one cup at a time, and it will fill taller cups also.  You can choose ""Bold"" if you like stronger coffee.  Just a great machine for us, and I highly recommend it."
"May 11, 2019",KDillon,5.0,,"it was time our old coffee maker died, i look at lots of models and order this one, from warehouse deals,  it showed up in the original box that looked like it had gone to the moon and back, the unit was in perfect shape. But where was the coffee carafe. I looked at a lot of units, and missed that this one has no carafe, wasn't to sure I liked that but decided to give it a try. We love it and would buy again"
"January 24, 2020",Gene,4.0,,Read all the reviews before purchasing and decided to give it a try. I think it keeps the coffee hot enough. It does seem to brew a milder cup (haven't played with the brew strength feature) but that's the way I like it. Have not had a problem with the rubber feet like some folks complain about. I find that I don't have to push very hard to get it to dispense.
"February 26, 2021",Elizabeth A. Doyle,1.0,,"I purchased one and used it for about a year and a half.  It started leaking, and it quit working.  I purchased another one, and after about a year and half, it did the same thing.  I purchased one, which just arrived a week ago, and it is already leaking and the filter is backing up.  I purchased the warranty this time, but after a week?  Really?  I would definitely not recommend.  I want my money back, and I am sorry I purchased the extended warranty."
"May 27, 2015",Mark Baldwin,5.0,,"Build a better mousetrap, er coffee maker and the world will beat a path to your door.  This is by far the most convenient and easiest coffee maker I've even owned.  Certainly from an engineering point of view, it could be improved, but that is always the story.  But when compared to the standard coffee maker, this is definitely a superior design.  It works perfectly and for those that know all the ways you can groggily make mistakes fixing coffee first thing in the morning, this eliminates most of them. If I was going to improve it, here are a few items... - Remove the screw bump on the inside of the hot container to make it easier to clean. - Make it easier to see the brewed coffee level. - Find a way that it is easy to slide when setting up, but difficult to slide when getting the coffee (this is a tricky engineering problem, perhaps impossible)."
"March 4, 2017",Melissa S.,4.0,,"Our previous coffee pot was a Hamilton Beach and we loved it.  Decided to give this one a try.  We were enticed by the features of no carafe and the easy individual cup dispensing.  All functions work as described and overall we are very happy with this product.  Unlike the video which shows ""hands free"" dispensing, we have to hold the base or the top so it does not get pushed back while we dispense the coffee (it is a slow slide backwards but none the less it does not stay in place as demonstrated in the video.) It made me wonder if it was sitting on top of some sort of rubber mat to stop the sliding so I put one under ours and presto magic!  The coffee maker no longer slides when we are ""hands free"" dispensing the coffee!"
"November 5, 2019",Shopalot,1.0,,"I am on my 3rd Hamilton Beach 48465 in three years. I tend to break glass carafes and don't find the thermal pots keep the coffee as hot as I like. I'm a daily coffee drinker and like to bring a mug to work. #1 was replaced after two years when the stream of coffee became so slow I couldn't wait for it. Cleaning the unit with vinegar didn't help so I ordered #2. It started leaking out of the box so I returned it to Amazon for a replacement unit. I received #3 in July 2019. Last week the on/off button went wonky and now only works intermittently. It is past the replacement date for an Amazon return so I have sent a request for a refund from Hamilton Beach. This is the coffeemaker that I hate to love, but after 4 in 5 years I'm going to look for one that can stand the test of time."
"February 18, 2016",Jessica Myers,4.0,One,"I don't like that the words rubbed off of the front pretty much the first time we cleaned it. It also leaks condensation at the bottom now that we've had it for something like 2 years--we put a dish towel underneath it and change that out when we use it, not a big deal, almost no effort. This maker is super convenient though and it DOES keep coffee just as hot as any other maker, if not hotter, in my experience. You can put it on Iced coffee mode, or not, on 1-4 cups, bold, change how long you want it to keep your coffee how (after which it'll shut itself off, so you never need to worry about doing so again). It's programmable, which is convenient, and it's got a little handle inside so that when you're taking it apart to empty it or clean it you're not awkwardly carrying it to the sink (we have a cart for coffee that's not super close to the sink so that's helpful for us)."
"June 3, 2019",bev miller,1.0,,i do not recommend this coffee maker.  i had an earlier version that conked out after about a year but this one only lasted about a month.  despite cleaning and doing all i should do per the instructions it simply will not complete brewing the coffee but i have to keep pushing the button every 5 minutes to restart in order to eek out a small amount.  buyer beware!  get something else!  i am.
"March 2, 2021",idahogirl5,1.0,,Don't buy it.. absolute plastic junk. Bought this at Christmas as we were in process buying new house and our old corroded SAME MODEL needed replaced. SHOULD'VE KEPT IT!!  I just made my 1st pot of coffee today and coffee leaks all around the dispenser button... RUNS OUT!!!  Absolutely disgusted!!! Too late to return..JUNK!!! DON'T BUY IT!!
"May 5, 2019",Julia S.,5.0,,This model is excellent for those who like to have several cups of coffee throughout the morning.  The design keeps the coffee from getting stale and sediment settling at the bottom of the traditional coffee carafe.  Each cup is the right temperature (not too hot nor lukewarm) and a treat to drink.  Plus the design makes coffee prep easy and - if a second pot is wanted - easy to prep another batch.
"January 11, 2018",Asli E,1.0,One,"I bought 2 of these in one year, thinking the first one was just a lemon. Within 2-3 months, both stopped working after moderate use. Coffee would drip messily when the dispenser button was pushed in, then quickly it would not brew at all. Additionally pouring water into the reservoir is always messy due to the poor design."
"October 14, 2020",J. Muri,2.0,,"Overall, I liked most of the features, including the removable water reservoir, ease of cleaning, but brand new leaked from the brewed coffee reservoir onto countertop.  I think the design is good, but the quality of manufacture is definitely lacking"
"February 10, 2021",Kenton Svetek,1.0,,"My product came damaged and broken. I'm not surprised though. The plastic used to make this coffee maker is paper thin. One of the hinges that holds the lid above the basket was already broken upon receiving this product. I will not be surprised when the other side of the hinge breaks as well. I think I could 3D print a better more durable version of this coffee maker on my own. Buyer Beware! Horrible quality and horrible quality control. Yes it does brew a pot of coffee, but I doubt this product lasts more than 6 months. Definitely NOT worth $50 or $60. Don't waste your money on this coffee maker."
"February 28, 2015",Alysia,2.0,One,"I bought this last year, and it has broken multiple times throughout. First, the part where coffee comes out would continuously drip, so every time we made coffee, brewed coffee would pour out without us pushing the button. Then it started burning my coffee grounds, so that smoke started coming out and we could smell burned plastic. At this point, it was still under warranty so I went ahead and contacted Hamilton Beach to replace it. They were prompt about it, so that was good. But a few months after getting my new one, the overheating problem started, so I don't use it anymore. Not worth the price for how much it has malfunctioned on me."
"June 13, 2014",Tinkerhead,4.0,One,"I bought this to have an automatic coffee maker and I thought the lack of caraffe was really cool. The automatic feature is easy to set and works flawlessly.  It's neat to serve a cup of coffee, no mess. It does make the churning noise noted in other reviews.  I haven't done the mod, because it doesn't bother me that much. The biggest complaint I have (loss of 5th star) is the temperature.  It isn't HOT.  It's hot, but if you add a refrigerated creamer, it's not as hot as your standard caraffe maker, and sometimes you need to put the cup in the microwave for a few seconds to heat it back up.  I have found that setting it to brew about 30 minutes before you intend to drink it helps.  It brews at a cooler temperature than it maintains."
"March 7, 2020",Ed41,5.0,,This is the second one I have owned.  I really like it because I don't make as much of a mess filling it with water.  Never was all that coordinated. I find it easy to make coffee and I like the dispensing system as it goes directly into the cup.
"June 23, 2013",Itisi0499,5.0,,"I have seen some bad reviews about products such as this one.From leaking to noise problem. I have to say that I do not understand why. My sister-in-law had one of these years ago, and I have always wanted one. I finally got this one for my birthday. IT MAKES THE BEST COFFEE! It is quiet, and every morning, I wake up,not the loud noise, but to the smell of coffee. The only sound I ever hear from it is when it lets me know that the coffee is made by 1 beep.  As far as leaking, I have had no problem whatsoever with this.  I love this brew-station!  I would totally recommend this product to anyone who loves a good,crisp cup of coffee. I especially like that it has such a long hold time when keeping coffee hot. It is so easy to clean, fill, and not too big for our counter space. It's just an all around great coffee brew station. I did find out though, that it does not take an ordinary reusable coffee filter. The one we had used for another coffee maker was too tall, and the lid on this one did not go down all the way with it. My husband just cut the filter down to size instead of purchasing the Hamilton Beach type, and it works just fine. Happy in Seattle. :)"
"July 16, 2018",J. Allen,2.0,,"This coffee maker never worked properly and I should have returned it quickly, but was lazy. Now it's not working at all. First, the on/off button never worked properly; I had to unplug the unit to turn it off, meaning it was a pain in the butt to make a second batch of coffee and reset all the settings. Now, I get an E03 and after an internet search find no one knows what this code is for! Great job Hamilton Beach."
"November 27, 2017",Mark Twain,5.0,,After three leaky normal coffee pots from three different makers I had to try this.  It makes coffee as fast as any other conventional coffee maker. The warm option allows for four hours of heated UNBURNT coffee.  No leaking on the counter top and no messy pouring.  I found filling the pot to be no problem at all and cleaning not a problem.  I will update if it goes out too soon.  I have no idea why I did not buy this first even at full price it is cheaper than replacing the leaking coffee pots.  I don't know what happend to quality in other makers for conventional drip machines.
"June 10, 2021",Lloyd,3.0,,This is probably the 10th Hamilton Beach Brewstation pot we have purchased over the last 15 years.  We drink a lot of coffee. This one is NOISY.  It constantly sounds like it is trying to brew coffee and just doesn't have enough water.
"September 19, 2015",Cat,5.0,2,"Love it. I researched long and hard for the best coffee machine, and I'm very happy I chose this one. I've had it for about 2 months now. My favorite things about it are: 1. The ""bold"" coffee setting. Tastes like a French press! Very rich and creamy, I absolutely hate ""watery"" coffee. So this is perfect. 2. You don't have to wait for the full amount to be brewed before you can drink. A minute in and there's a cup's worth already available to you. This is possible thanks to the press-and-release coffee spout instead of having to manually pour it from a pot. 3. You can make iced coffee with it. ICED COFFEE PEOPLE. I recommend freezing some leftover coffee in ice cube trays and using those to make it. This is an awesome, sleek looking coffee machine. I would recommend it to anyone."
"January 14, 2021",Anthony 33,3.0,,"This coffee maker was great for the first 12 months,  however after that time, it started leaking the entire water reservoir about once every 2 weeks; other reviews note it leaks after 8 months.  So, for a relatively cheap coffee maker, with some great features,  I would consider this a disposable  product and replace every 9-10 months."
"March 14, 2016",Kandyce Peveto,4.0,,"I have had this coffee maker for about a month now. It is really easy to use. One day my husband brought me a cup of coffee before the bell had chimed indicating the coffee was ready. My coffee was barely warm. So, you want to make sure you wait for the bell to chime before you get a cup or plan to heat it up in the microwave. That process seems to take longer than other coffee makers. The motor that runs to keep the coffee hot is loud and constant. If there are other people talking and/or the tv or radio going or you are in not in the kitchen then you probably won't notice it but on the mornings I am up by myself it is a little annoying. It is loud enough that I am afraid it is going to stop working sooner rather than later. One thing I did not think about before purchasing this coffee maker is the fact that the receptacle the coffee is kept hot in is plastic. This bothers some people and if I had it to do over, I probably would choose a coffee maker with a glass or metal carafe. Overall, for the price, this is a good coffee maker. Time will tell if it was worth the money."
"June 3, 2021",Irene,2.0,,"Less than impressed. I've owned 2 of the brew stations in the past and loved them.  The ""upgrades"" they've made since I purchased my last one a couple of years ago, are awful.  2nd day using it... every time I try to get a cup of coffee, it makes a mess.  Goes not only in the drip pan but all over my counter! Will be going to town this weekend and purchasing a basic coffee maker.  Hamilton Beach has lost me as a Brew Station owner.  So disappointed. ... They should have avoided making their upgrades, as it used to be a great machine!"
"February 9, 2019",Thomas B.,1.0,One,"After less than 2 months (purchased Dec 18, today is Feb 15) the coffee maker is dead in the water. Will not power up, will not do anything. No elecical surge occured and everything else plugged into the same outlet is perfectly fine. This coffee maker was really pretty nice, until it died... Was east to brew, was very east to dispense... But when it will no longer power up its complete trash now."
"January 7, 2020",Amanda Beaty,1.0,,"Then it would not pump the water into the tank. I tried to get the company , but to no avail. I looked up on YouTube, cleaned it, followed all the directions. Finally, I sent it back. I was really sad. I have used the same kind for years, but then they ""improved"" it and it no longer worked!"
"September 17, 2019",tim r.,2.0,One,"bought new brew station after having one for years older model , was great just wore out , new model had some great improvements  except that during keep warm cycle coffee  maker is very noisy with a irritating gurgling sound for 4 hours so not sure why that is with all the other changes they made , called hamilton beach they said that was normal ! hummmm , seems like a step backwards to me ."
"November 7, 2020",Sheila Schetrompf,5.0,,Ove this coffee maker! We have used this brand/style for a really long time. Easy to fill detachable water part and best of all coffee stays in top and you use the dispenser for fresh coffee whenever. We set it to shut off after 2 hours and heat in microwave later when we want some. Tastes just as good as when you first made it! Love love love!
"February 24, 2017",R C Gilbert,5.0,,"I am loving this machine! The coffee does not scorch even when set for 4 hours. I love the bold flavor setting capability, however, it takes a little longer to brew on this setting. The program button is a little tricky because it does not engage immediately (maybe I got a bad one) but I keep at it until it works 8 out of 10 times. Do t let that last comment stop you from purchasing because it is absolutely amazing to just walk to the machine and press your mug against a release panel underneath, and fill it with coffee...heavenly!"
"June 16, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"When I first bought this 2 months ago, I loved it….it didn’t leak like my older one, and made great coffee. Last week I wanted to use it and it didn’t turn on at all. After going through many attempts and checks, I decided it must be faulty. I went through all the steps to get in touch with Hamilton Beach with no success. Is it too much to ask for a return call?"
"January 9, 2020",Brittany Hardecki,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker! It's our second one now. The first lasted over 4 years. It probably could've lasted longer with a good cleaning of the screen, the coffee began to dribble slowly out so we were having to take out the whole top part to pour coffee efficiently. Again, that's probably on us. It would've been simple to take the screen out and give it a scrub. Otherwise, the only other issue is that it stopped ""warming"" only when you tried to reheat leftover coffee in it. If you hold the power button down for a few seconds, it's supposed to turn the heating element on but not run a new cycle. It started beeping loudly and asking for water when trying to use this feature. Anyway, the new one has had several runs so far and is working just as great! We love it!!!!!"
"March 3, 2014",Ian,4.0,,"Second one I have purchased. The last I owned 5 years. We are rtired and like making a big pot in the morning to share while we watch the news and wake up. Looking around locally, everthing was either a glass pot (not a fan of overcooked coffee) or the new pod type systems. Felt a bit pushed into the pod type-hype. They are very expensive and so are the pods for what you get. If we only drank a cup each in the morning, it might be worth that, but it does not work for us. I went to the HB website and it was double the price from Amazon, I even got a $5 digital coupon with my Amazon. One criticism would be, it is a little taller than the older system, and does not fit under the cabinet of my coffee shrine. You may want to add the height to the details."
"June 28, 2020",MisterB,2.0,,"I regret buying this. It looks nice and the coffee tastes good, but it is very loud as it brews, it has a lot of condensation so the whole thing is dripping wet, and the reservoir is separate from the basket which you have to lift out and it’s dripping wet as well, which is an extra item to deal with."
"December 20, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Nobody needs a pot or carafe if you're drinking  coffee at home! No pot drips from pouring! Love this coffee pot! Well this pre-made post is exactly what I was thinking of writing! There is no need to have a pot that can break and drip all over your counter or table! Just go up to the pot fill it up your cup and then another cup and another cup!excellent idea I will never buy anything but a brew master as long as it stays in production!
"November 15, 2017",Geeseofbeverlyroad87,2.0,,"Subpar coffee maker with some nice features.I have owned this coffee maker for a little over a year, and finally decided to upgrade. I enjoyed the timed brew feature, which afforded us the luxury of having a “fresh” pot of coffee each morning upon waking. One caveat: the coffee is really bad. I have tried all varieties of beans, and they all taste considerably worse than when brewing with a French press. The coffee maker is also quite difficult to clean sufficiently, which is probably a major factor in the less-than-decent tasting coffee. Finally, the coffee maker does a terrible job keeping the coffee hot. The reservoir has a heating plate built in, but it left a lot to be desired. Generally the coffee was warm at best—certainly not hot. My recommendation would be to steer clear of this coffee maker, unless you’re really adamant about having the timed brew feature and no carafe. Otherwise, opt for something else. 2/5"
"November 17, 2018",GrandpaJesse,4.0,,"This pot brews very good coffee in a short amount of time.  It will keep it warm for up to 4 hrs, you set it how you want it. There is no carafe with this machine, it has a tank that holds the hot coffee.  My only complaint is that I have difficulty pouring the water into the tank without spilling it.  After the 4 hour warmer shuts off I have to pour the coffee into my cup and heat it in the microwave, there is no reheat option.  For the extra price I wish I had just gotten a regular pot with a carafe."
"May 17, 2020",Jerry C Williams,1.0,,"Had this for only about 6 weeks and noticed it started to leak a small amount while brewing. Now, just alittle over 4mo. old , it leaks so badly , we can no longer use. Also bought the 4yr. warranty, which is no help because it's still under the manufacturers warranty. Amazon says to call the provider of the warranty and they said they couldn't help either, so you decide."
"March 1, 2020",LisaG,5.0,,"We have used this same coffee pot for over 10 years. Eventually they will leak from the tank, some issue with a rubber piece that wears out. I don’t care, just get another one. Makes fantastic hot coffee, easy to operate, I highly recommend"
"June 21, 2013",Bluestocking,5.0,,"My other brew station finally ""gave up the ghost"" as my grandmother would say. I am so happy about that! I read the 1 star reviews about the spout being too far back and not centered. This is somewhat true. The spout is further back and not centered, but slightly tilting the cup makes for a perfect pour. I have used a travel mug, large coffee mug and small coffee cup, the coffee poured without spilling and a good half inch from the lip of the cup. If you use dainty cups, this might not be the right brew station for your needs. You don't have to press that hard on the dispenser either. Additionally, the burner is centered so that all the coffee is hot and stays that way. Also, the bucket has water level marks on the inside. The clock light on the front is very bright blue. I'm sure there is a way to dim it, but then I would have to open the manual (as if ). Great brew station!"
"January 27, 2014",Heather Smith,4.0,,"We like this coffee maker fine. Like others have said, it is better in some ways than the old versions (the separate water container was a good idea) but overall I can't say we like it as well as previous models. It is harder to push the coffee dispenser, for example, and takes up more space and so doesn't look as sleek. The light on ours shorted out within a month, but to Amazon and Hamilton Beach's credit they sent us a replacement immediately. This was true even though we bought a refurbished unit. As a side note, we had to replace our previous version because the electronic display stopped working properly (we had had it for a couple of years), so the electronics are definitely a problem with all of these Brewstations. Overall good machine, though, and having the coffee stay warm without (often) burning and having it dispense directly into a cup without mess or spillage outweigh the cons in our minds."
"June 13, 2020",Kathleen Carlton,4.0,,"Great coffee pot however it is lightweight so it slides across the counter when you press your cup to the dispenser lever.  So needs to be against a backsplash or you need to hold onto the unit to stop it from sliding away.  If not for this, I would have given it 5 start."
"November 24, 2018",Terri F,2.0,,"Liked the No Carafe model, was very convenient.  You hold mug under and push lever to release coffee into the mug.  But unfortunately it started leaking nonstop without the lever being pushed (I think a spring broke) and wouldn't hold the coffee inside any longer. This just occurred last month, Oct. 2018.  (Entire pot just leaked out all over the counter because we were not aware it was broken and not in the kitchen while it was happening.)  It was not terribly pricey, but I still think it should have lasted more than 10 months.  (I had a very cheap coffee pot in the past (@ $10 Dollar General) which lasted for 3 + years.  Never actually stopped working, I just decided to to upgrade.)  Overall I am disappointed in this product."
"April 3, 2016",PinkCoyote,2.0,,"We had a previous version of the brewstation and really liked it, but it started to leak after a few years so I bought this newer version. I'm disappointed with it. The 2 silicone rubber feet to keep the station from sliding when pressing your mug against the lever always fall out when you slide the station out along the granite counter top to start making coffee. I'll have to super glue or hot glue them in place. Secondly, after the coffee is made the unit sounds like it is continuously boiling the coffee.You can hear it from the family room about 20 feet away while watching TV."
"July 21, 2014",meg,4.0,One,"Saw this same model at Target for $20 more. I bought it for the no-carafe feature, the separate water box, and the ease of making iced coffee. For all of those, plus the GREAT coffee, it merits five stars. The ""bold"" setting makes a good cuppa with less ground coffee, too. As long as it is within the ""keep warm"" time frame, it's piping hot. I knocked off a star because of the condensation, but it is a problem I can live with. The condensation collects in two chambers underneath the container that holds the coffee and filter (the part on top, right above the clock/display in the picture). Each time I wash the container, I soak up the collected condensation with a dishcloth--it's clean plain water, not smelly or anything, and the amount seems to vary batch to batch. It's a quick job, no big deal, but I can see where not doing this would eventually cause ""leaks."" Condensation is a common problem with many kinds and brand of coffee makers, including more expensive ones. I would definitely buy it again!"
"November 5, 2018",Jo,1.0,,"I am returning a SECOND maker.  I am not interested in drinking BOILED COFFEE !!!! Not only does it ruin it, defeat the purpose of this maker, but in my  opinion it is a HAZARD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is the second one I have tried and I do not have any more time to waste on these makers ! They are defective ! so until they REDESIGN THEM ! I am in the market for a new brand.  Very sad ! I have used these types of makers for over 10 years :("
"December 5, 2019",Pegg Fisher,1.0,One,Plugged it in two weeks ago. Timer never worked. Today would not brew all the water. Will not buy another. Liked it better before water feed was moved to the side.
"October 18, 2018",Ang,2.0,One,Bought this based on the great reviews but we didn’t have a good experience. Coffee tasted like plastic even after washing per the instructions several times. The brew strength wasn’t consistent either. Big and clunky to get in and out of our sink and to clean.
"September 7, 2017",CraftyMamaCyta,5.0,,"So i just got this and i put it to run right away because i baught the ""used"" one, what money is tight and i got bills to pay. It works great. This machine was easy to program and brew a decent cup of coffee. I thought i would have issues because im use to the french press ( my husband kept complaining it was to much hassle for him at 4 am). Whats really awesome is that morning when i woke up .... imagine spongebob intermission saying 3 hours later... the coffee was still fresh and hot, oh did i tell you this pot has a strong brew button. Dont miss the french press to much but keeping it around for my oprah tea, yumm."
"December 16, 2019",Esther Wiliiams,5.0,,I searched for this machine because I love the dispenser.  It can dispense to any height drink cup I own and never drips over the side like a carafe.  The removable reservoir makes filling up the water easy and I can keep coffee warm up to 3 hours.  We've used it for several months now and have not had any issues.
"June 2, 2016",Rob Walter,5.0,,"This is a great value. When our Keurig conked out and I couldn't easily fix it myself, my wife and I decided to try and kick the K-Cup habit. We certainly didn't want to defeat the purpose and spend a lot to do it. I found this one after comparing A LOT of models. I think a lot of the coffeemakers out there now have too many extra features, and therefore have more things that could go wrong. This one is fairly simple, but that's also what makes it reliable. It brews the coffee, it has a timer, it has an extended warming feature, and those are the features I use. You can adjust the strength of the coffee, but I don't tend to do that. It is not very heavy or substantial, but I don't get the impression it's going to fail anytime soon."
"July 17, 2019",Deborah Kelly-Corn,4.0,,"Pros: I really like the style and idea of the design. It's really easy to clean and use.  And easy to read water/coffee windows Cons: it's light weight and needs to be up against something for easy one hand use. Also there's no bell/alarm to let you know when it's done, and it makes a continuous heating/simmering sound."
"August 3, 2020",Michael Antes,1.0,,"Coffee tastes good, it's hot. But I have a major gripe with this machine. It constantly drips coffee on the outside of my cup every other time I dispense coffee. I now have coffee stained paper towel next to my coffee machine because I'm always having to wipe coffee from the outside of my cup because this coffee machine is poorly made and doesn't properly dispense coffee without it getting on the outside of the cup. If you like wasting napkins, paper towel, and your time. Get this coffee machine so you can become and expert at wiping coffee from the outside of your cup."
"August 3, 2019",Nick,2.0,,Seemed okay at first. I thought other reviews were crazy complaining about the leaks as I did not experience this. But after 6 months it became a problem. I put up with it for another 6 months and tossed it. Was a pain to clean also. Lesson learned.
"December 3, 2019",Tom,1.0,One,"Making coffee. Received 11-17. On Thanksgiving, we woke to coffee all over our countertop and floor. The pot emptied itself again on 12-3 but we caught it in time. Button to release coffee into cup is stuck. As soon as it perks, the coffee pot emptied itself since the button was stuck. Can't get it to release. Our last pot like this lasted 15 years. This one barely made it 15 days."
"April 12, 2020",Druann,2.0,,"Broken after 3 months. I loved all of the features of this coffee pot and was very excited to use it and have enjoyed using it for the past 3 months, but now it is already broken. We had the coffee set to brew, came out in the morning to coffee all over the counter and floor. Wrote it off as the dispenser getting stuck one time, popped it out and continued to use. Now two weeks later it happened again. We are not hard on this button and check it when we set it at night. The spring inside seems faulty or somehow gets stuck and now that we have encountered two messes, we will not continue to use."
"August 28, 2019",Alan Shenefield,4.0,,"I've has three so far. I love the design and ease of getting coffee with a push. Now they do wear out. Don't remember first one, but second one little gasket got old, little drip. But worked, just decided to get new on. New one seems to make crackling noise while it on whole time. Sent one back because I thought something is wrong, replacement does the same thing. But because I love how you use it I just keep it."
"May 2, 2019",kc,1.0,,"The water tank doesn't sit properly...on a bit of an angle.  The Hamilton Beach logo actually rubbed off when I cleaned the coffee maker, using just water and a dish rag.  I contacted Hamilton Beach directly and sent them the serial number, etc.  I heard back from them with a generic response.  I responded stating that if they indeed make this product, it was shoddy workmanship.  No response.  Since the machine makes coffee, I didn't go through the hassle of returning it, but I will never, ever buy a Hamilton Beach product again."
"August 4, 2019",Tina Rubinstein,3.0,,"The coffee maker is okay. It does move, so you would be wise to have it against a wall to prevent it from moving. It is bulkier than what I am used to. My travel coffee mug did not fit underneath. I would have to tilt it sideways. It does have a ""blue light"" which is one of the things that attracted me to this coffee maker when I was looking for a replacement. I went back to my ""basic"" coffee pot. I found it easier to clean and more compact."
"September 25, 2020",sugarmami,5.0,,"After almost 6 have it to own it, I gave it away, the push button to dispense the coffee always spill coffee, need to be very very very careful not to spill, I need to  make a pose to see what is going on under the dispenser! I replace it for a B&D stainless carafe, the best!"
"November 7, 2020",Pearl,4.0,,"Slides back on the counter when pushing your cup up to the lever but, we added rubber to the front feet since they didn't have any. If you hold the side it won't slide. Makes a little gurgling noise while keeping the coffee warm but, not a problem. Makes good coffee. Super easy to clean!"
"November 7, 2018",Tara T,1.0,,I’ve had this coffee maker for 8 months and it has been leaking for the past 2 months; as much as a half a cup of coffee. We keep a mug under the spout just to catch the dripping. It has stained my white counters from all the leaking. Not to mention the label on the from with the Hamilton name has rubbed completely rubbed off. Which makes be believe this wasn’t a genuine Hamilton product. This was a total waste of my money not to mention the damage to my counters.
"June 27, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"I have owned one of these for years and LOVED it. It would leak some coffee outside the cup but usually only when the reservoir was almost empty,  it eventually started leaking badly after a few years of use.  Figuring it was age, or that I ruined something in the cleaning, I ordered another exact same model. Like I said I loved it. BUT, the new one, now into the second week of daily use is leaking more coffee on the counter than you get in the mug even when the reservoir is full and your pouring the first cup. I'm hoping the company will send a replacement and fix that glitch."
"May 6, 2020",kyle,2.0,,The coffee pot takes forever to fill up and when you push your cup up against the back lever for the coffee to dispense it drips off the back part down the front of the coffee pot into the drainage laid however it does work and I replace our Walmart coffee pot with this one and it seems the Walmart ones work better
"May 21, 2020",Commander,2.0,,The dispense leaks every time you get coffee. You'll have to clean the side of the cup and the coffee maker. Good thing there is a catch tray at the bottom but having to clean it and the cup since coffee drips all over the cup when dispensing makes it an annoyance for me. Returning it.
"May 29, 2020",Karen Foster,1.0,,"I was excited to get this for our office. It was exactly what i was looking for. I just got it and the first new did not go well at all. On the regular Brew setting, using one Melita filter, the water overflowed the filter and the coffee is NOT hot. If argue that my tap hot water is hotter. I'm going to measure the temp and I'll revise with the temperature."
"June 18, 2016",Ladyjn13,5.0,8,"This coffee maker has so many features, I just love it! What's really nice is that it has a special setting for making 1 to 4 cups that most other 12 cup coffee makers don't even think about including but helps make this a more versatile machine. While I work from home in the software industry, I'm certainly not a caffeine junky and only drink 2 to 4 cups a day. You just can't make less than 4 cups in a normal 12 cup coffee maker and expect the coffee to be drinkable. Additionally, my husband loves the bold setting. Oh, and another cool feature is that it's programmable, so you can wake up to the smell of fresh brewed coffee in the morning. The gentle keep warm feature is just one of the other amazing features of this unit, insuring the first cup is as perfect as last!"
"May 23, 2021",Sheila Machado,3.0,,"I had a Hamilton for 18 years, before it started to leak, 18 years! I bought this one it was almost the same, except it had water fill on the side, but it started to leak a bit. Ugh, I then tightened the screws, I think one I will have to add a silicone to it. I really believed in this product, I don't think it will last 18 years... But it makes good coffee, good timer and options for warming time. Thank you! Sheila M."
"July 24, 2020",Islander C,1.0,,"Just bought this version to replace my other older Brewstation.  I do not like this version at all.  I do not recommend a purchase of this model.  It LEAKS.  If you buy this version, keep a towel underneath it & when pouring a cup, a paper towel will suffice.  Contacted Hamilton Beach customer service twice.  No response.  Contacted through FB, they tell me contact customer service.  And they are still selling this horrible product everywhere."
"May 10, 2021",James Stubenrauch,1.0,,"I don't normally like to return things, but this piece of garbage had to be returned. I didn't have it for a month and it started leaking. I clean it every time I used it and did not have any build up. The tank would leak only if the liquid was hot. I used cold water to find were it was leaking, but nothing. I thought I was over filling but no. I ran 10 cups of water through and then I found where the tank was leaking. Seems there was a crack at the base of the tank where it was plastic welded but only leaked when the liquid was hot. I spent more time cleaning up from the leak than drinking coffee."
"July 12, 2020",Kristine Fiorilla,1.0,,"Received coffee maker on May 30,2020. It leaks from the bottom - no cracks or anything just leaks coffee. contacted product services they asked that I clean the reservoir and run it through a few cycles. Still leaks. I will call them again today. Not happy that I had to spend time cleaning a new coffee maker, I think they should offered to replace the coffee maker but we will see what happens today. I will update."
"March 12, 2016",Patrick,3.0,One,On my third one.  I gave it 3 stars because it gets cheaper every time I buy it.  I like the fact that there is no carafe and it is easy to use.  I dislike what a pain it is to clean and the fact that they have a non removable screen inside which makes it seem like they deliberately didn't care about making this thing long lasting and user friendly.  Eventually no matter what these screens get clogged beyond your ability to clean them and occasionally the seals also go bad causing a drip from the spout.  I guess it I get 2 years out of it I am happy.  Wish it had a better reservoir for the water...something more like a Keurig in that respect.
"January 15, 2021",Christopher S,1.0,,"I had a Brew station for years, and loved everything about it, except the size.  I got it before I was married, and for one person it made the perfect amount of coffee.... 2 mugs. I upgraded to this since there are more people in the house and after using it a week, I am very disappointed in the fact that it can not dispense the coffee without leaving a puddle of coffee on the counter. I really wanted to love this machine like i loved the previous one. Its great except it leaks down the front when you dispense coffee.. the drip tray can not contain it. Will be returning"
"November 6, 2018",Denah R.,4.0,,I LOVE that this coffee pot can be taken almost completely apart to clean it. My old coffee pot totally grossed me out when I realized how much gunk was down in the water reservoir. That is not an issue with this pot. You take the reservoir off and can scrub it in the sink. I saw that some people said theirs leaked but we haven't had any leaks. My only complaint with this pot is that it brews through too fast so the coffee is weak even on bold mode. Simple fix is to just double up on filters. Now my coffee is perfect and will even stay hot up to 4 hours.
"March 7, 2016",Yuriy,5.0,,"Recent medical studies show that drinking coffee has tremendous health benefits.  You can save a lot of money by brewing your own.  A medium cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee runs about $2.25.  If you purchase this machine and brew your own coffee (assuming 30.5 oz ground coffee costs about $8), it will pay for itself after just 17 cups.  This machine works great, and has the gives you the option of brewing ""Bold"", or stronger coffee for an extra kick.  I love the timer option, which allows you to set the timer to brew a cup of your favorite coffee waiting for you when you wake up."
"June 8, 2020",Charles J Girard,2.0,,"Sadly, this coffee maker just has a poor design. Good things: I liked the tank option to use it as a dispenser like a refrigerator-super convenient. When it worked, it worked as described. Bad things: first one began leaking after about 3 or 4 weeks. Replacement began leaking after 1 week. The problem is the gasket seal in the tank. Both failed exactly the same way and leaked coffee out the bottom of the machine. Also, lifting the lid after coffee is brewed results in a waterfall of condensation that requires a little clean up. Besides that, I did like it. I wished it had a better design, but alas, gasket failure seems inevitable."
"February 25, 2017",AJay_89,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker! Bought for work. Our coffee club has a tendency to break carafes and spill coffee when pouring. It's literally impossible for them to do it, now! I am very pleased with this purchase! Note: DO NOT BUY THE PERMANENT COFFEE FILTER THAT'S ADVERTISED. The filter does not fit the coffee maker and will leave the lid ajar. I thought that since it was the same company and it was recommended on Amazon, it would be a good purchase. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE."
"February 9, 2021",Charles Edwards Sr.,1.0,,"Poor design for filling the dispensing reservoir by removing the filter holder and  warming reservoir to be able to see and fill the dispenser. Leakage would occur behind the cup dispenser and run down the side of the cup and also into the drip tray after the cup is removed. Attempted to contacted the manufacturer by phone, due to Corona Virus they are not working or answering the phone. Sent in support form explaining the problem, never to hear from manufacturer."
"October 31, 2013",T. Weverka,5.0,,"My husband loves this coffee maker. I bought it for him but I was worried because of the bad reviews saying that  it spills. We have had NO issues with this. It keeps the coffee fresh and hot and when we want a cup, we get one with no spills. Great product. Plus it was fast shipping. Only thing I didnt like was that it shipped in the box that it comes in. Usually when I buy something from amazon, it is in a brown box. This was not an issue because I was able to get home before my husband saw it on the front step. I would have been upset if he would have gotten home before me because this was a gift for him and he would have seen what it was. But that is my only only complaint.  As far as the coffee maker goes, its a great product and looks nice too."
"November 23, 2020",diane,4.0,,Did not open this coffee maker because it was too tall for the space I wanted to use it.  The coffeemaker was new but not re-boxed like traditional merchandise we normally get. It was sent in the retail box and was delivered to our home with damage to the front of the box. I didn’t open the box because I will need to send the coffeemaker back. Just hoping that a “heads up” message gets to the shipping department or customer service. I was unable to find a email address for Amazon returns. No reflection on the coffeemaker.
"February 10, 2019",Crystal Aldrich,5.0,,"Quick shipping, package was good...  I have been using this style coffee maker since they came out...  Love not having to pour coffee & spill all over like the other style ones do...  Just push cup on the lever & have coffee flow in...  This is a replacement...  I also give as gifts to folks that are coffee drinkers...  I make several pots of coffee a day, so it gets lots of use...  Washes up nice too...  I do use a pitcher to fill the water container instead of the coffee storage unit... but that is my choice with a bad shoulder it's just easier for me..."
"February 12, 2021",Wes,1.0,,"I replaced a previous Brewstation that worked for many years.  This new one leaks when dispensing.  A stream of coffee will flow down the front where your coffee cup is filled.  I'd estimated I lose about a cup of coffee from a full pot, about 20%, enough to overflow the catch tray. Unfortunately, I threw out the packaging when I got it since my old one worked so well for so long, so no option for return."
"March 21, 2018",ROBYN HOLDER,4.0,,"I like this coffee maker except for one thing.  It is noisy.  It is a great machine.  I love the water tank and how it comes off the machine to fill with water at the sink.  You cannot get coffee out of the maker without holding the back of it so you can press the dispensary button.....otherwise when you push the coffee cup in, the machine itself goes backwards.  While brewing and until it stops warming, it makes a sizzle noise.  Coffee tastes just fine.  I'm keeping this coffee maker and will just live with all the noise."
"November 18, 2016",mamavee,2.0,One,"Loved this coffeemaker for the last couple months we have owned it. Does what it says and keeps the coffee hot and fresh without scorching, which is wonderful. The problem comes when it's time to clean the machine. The instructions say to use a pint of vinegar and then run a few cycles of clean water through it. We did this several times and the coffeemaker display continues to flash ""CLEAN."" Went back, rechecked the manual, did everything correct, and we still have the flashing ""CLEAN."" This shouldn't be complicated. Next time we will stick to Keurig."
"July 27, 2014",Dd,1.0,3,"We had a brew station prior to this machine, which is why we decided to buy it. We got this new and updated version of the brew station and were excited to use it. After the first or second time, we noticed water collecting underneath the reservoir where the coffee collects once brewed. That issued continued to occur. Now, today, on this Sunday morning, we go to brew coffee, and it started to make and then completely stopped!!!!! We only bought this 2 months ago and the previous machine lasted us several years!!! We are not happy with this and now, according to the order page, it's been too long to return it."
"October 28, 2017",LUV2BEEP,4.0,,"Very nice to not have a carafe!  Love the coffee maker but it could use a few improvements. 1 -  The bottom is not weighted so unless it is placed against a wall one cannot dispense coffee because the pot  slides around.  2- the dispensing tab has a molded line across it making it more difficult to push the cup into the tab.  3 - if the window to view the amount of coffee left could be placed on the front, that would help instead of having to look around to the side of the pot and 4 - the tray at the bottom is just cheap plastic - not that it affects function - but it does not match the quality of the pot. Now - for the good things!  - So very nice to remove and fill the dispenser and not have to pour water into the coffee pot!!!  Nice not to have a carafe that can be broken!  Nice and easy to pick up handle where coffee resides and pour excess coffee and clean it out!  Coffee stays much hotter than any coffee pots I've ever owned."
"February 17, 2021",tunalover,5.0,,It is perfect for us. No glass carafe to break. It has the cutest “gas gauge” to let you know how much coffee is left.  Easy to clean. We’ve been drinking coffee for 40 plus years and this is the very best coffee maker we’ve ever had!
"September 4, 2018",Barbara A. Halsell,4.0,,"I like the fast brew. A little annoying to have to remove coffee filter basket AND tank to add more water to reservoir to brew a bit more coffee. The burner under the tank makes some noise while keeping the coffee hot, Very sturdy though and it stays put while dispensing coffee, no sliding. Overall, I am happy with this unit."
"April 20, 2016",Lizzieeroo,5.0,,"Have been using this machine for years without any problem - only that the water residue had built up within the unit. Bought a second one to replace the first but ended up being able to descale and clean it with no issues! Kept this second one as backup instead of returning it bc this is a great machine. Love the ease of use and how there's no coffee pot. I really like the dispenser - no leaks or anything! I bought a smaller one as a gift and that one is working great, too, from what I hear; they're still using it!"
"August 7, 2020",Product Analyst,3.0,,"The coffee maker is sleek concept with storing the coffee in an interior tank and fills similar to how a refrigerator water dispenser works. It definitely is something uncommon but anyone I that sees it compliments it. I do have one issue: if the coffee storage tank isn’t empty by the time the warmer turns off, my coffee maker releases the rest of its contents all over the counter. I’m not sure if that typical though."
"November 9, 2020",Dan Pavela,3.0,,"We have loved this coffee maker up until this current weekend when it started leaking ANY excess coffee stored in the carafe part- all over our counter... upon testing and investigation of where the leake is coming from, we found that the screws/metal plate from the bottom of the carafe may not be working as well? We are not sure. But we are trying to correct it ourselves right now as well as looking into the warranty, complaint to manufacturer as well as asking for a replacement since it has not even been used for a year yet, and we haven't even used it daily..."
"January 16, 2019",Eleanor Infantino,5.0,,"I like that I don't have to have a coffee pot to catch the liquid. Though I rarely drink iced coffee, it's nice to have the ability to brew it without a mess in my kitchen. The programmable option is helpful if I have an early day to plan for. I MUST have my coffee!!!! Good purchase for me."
"May 13, 2020",Jayson P,1.0,,The worst coffee maker ever. Coffee is leaking from heated reservoir. Not even 6 months old with occasional use. I liked the pot less design but the coffee was never warm enough yet the metal warmer was very noisy and seemed to almost boil. Tried to contact  manufacturer but there are no phone lines being answered and I'm unable to make an online claim.
"December 14, 2019",NWJEEPER541,4.0,,"It works great, brews coffee relatively fast and easy to clean and easy to start brewing...but it has one downfall; only coffee mugs fit underneath, none of my travel mugs I use every day fit, so I have to put it on the side of the counter to dispense, which is kind of a hassle but not too bad. Will buy a different type when this one dies. But worth the money. Thanks."
"December 14, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I loved this coffee pot when it worked.  It's a great concept, but they used a REALLY cheap plastic piece for the dispensing mechanism and it NEVER worked right.  I always had to take the pot apart, while hot, to reconnect the button so we could get coffee out.  After about 3-6 months of messing with it, my husband threw it away and bought an old fashioned coffee mate."
"February 29, 2016",Pammles,4.0,,"Our old coffee maker by Hamilton Beach finally bit the dust after 10 years {sniffle} & we had to get a new one. I really like the concept of no coffee pot & just being able to insert the cup underneath, so it made sense that we would get the same (or similar in my case) coffee maker that we've been so happy with. No complaints really, just a couple pet-peeves... The rubber feet that adhere to the base don't stay in place when I push into the button to fill my cup. I'm just going to have to relocate my coffee maker so that there's a wall behind it to keep it from moving. Otherwise, I would totally recommend this to anyone!"
"May 12, 2020",Dawn Booker,3.0,,"I've had it for over 5 months now, and these are my 2 complaints: 1. The coffee is not hot enough when just brewed. I have to microwave it in my mug for half a minute to make it hot enough to drink. 2. After the freshly brewed coffee sits in the reservoir, it quickly evaporates and gets very strong. The ""burner"" is way too hot. In about 1 hour about half the volume evaporates. In summary, it comes out not hot enough, but then gets too hot."
"June 23, 2016",Aubrey,5.0,,"I am a big fan of coffee maker. I bought a new one, because I have a 7+ yr old one that lost its ability for programming it to brew in the morning. (I still use it at my vacation house though.) The new one is sleeker-looking than the old one and has a few minor but appreciated updates (most notably a dam across the water spout to help keep it from spilling over while filling the reservoir like the old one seemed prone to do if you poured to quickly). These updates make it even easier to use, and you can't beat the convenience of the single-pour! Note: I do not have problem with it dripping like others have mentioned, and although I've only had it for a month, I believe it is a durable product made with quality based on the longevity of my old one and this one seems even better."
"March 12, 2019",katelynn,5.0,One,Its been a while since owning this product and Im happy to say my family and I feel like were still using a new item. Worth buying for large families.
"February 12, 2017",BONES,5.0,,This is a Great coffee maker for the price. I have been using the Keurig for years and forgot how much better coffee is from a REAL maker. This maker works Great. Can make a desired quantity of coffee and take what you want with the press cup to dispense feature. Coffee will stay warm for 4 hrs with no burning (coffee stores in body of maker)  Cleaning is simple as parts remove easy.  Very happy with this machine and for $35 on Lightning deal-No BRAINER
"February 21, 2021",Kirk P Bidwell,3.0,,"I was very happy with this coffee maker. It was easy to use, easy to clean. About three weeks before the first anniversary of purchase, it began leaking coffee from the reservoir, where the heating plate is attached. It appears that Hamilton Beach is not going to honor the warranty. On their web site, they say the phone lines for customer support are closed due to COVID. I sent them an email. There has been no response."
"January 9, 2021",B. Savage,3.0,,"I gave it 3 stars because, ultimately,  it makes coffee. It does it's job. However, it leaks....constantly.  There are definitely design flaws. But I will say that I keeps the coffee very hot and I like that. Just watch out for the leaks. They make a mess."
"April 10, 2020",Curtis,5.0,,"On Board tank keeps coffee hot or you can have heating element turn off as soon as coffee has finished perking. Tall cups fit under the dispenser to fill my 4 cup mug with ease.  This is the second one that I have owned and will buy again if needed in the future. I tried another brand, MR. Co..ee. It didn't dispense coffee using gravity as this one does. It had to be pumped out using a noisy motor that the neighbors could probably hear. This one should not disappoint."
"March 28, 2021",Rich Dasaro,5.0,,"Makes coffee ,, Thats all you need ,, Its actually a perfect pot ,, I like how this dispenses without pouring i actually replaced a high dollar fancy coffee pot with this one i like this better and its price point is perfect"
"June 17, 2020",CallMeTracy,5.0,,This is my 3rd or 4th brewing station. I fret when I need to order another one in fear of not finding this coffee pot. I will not use anything else. The coffee is always hot and brews fairly quickly. My only issue is not able to find replacement parts.
"February 15, 2021",Arizona Snake Charmer,1.0,,This particular model was unsatisfactory because of the location of the water reservoir (hard to fill).  Also the sensor showing water/coffee level did not work well.  I exchanged it for the model with a removal water reservoir located on the side and it isgreat.  I really like the Brewmaster model I now have.
"August 11, 2020",Sue,1.0,,"Worst coffee pot I ever bought. Unfortunately I didnt save box or recipe,  otherwise I would have tried to exchange it. Leaks all over the counter. Will be tossing and buying a new coffee pot. Hate to throw things out as it's such a waste of money. Dont purchase this product."
"May 29, 2019",Warrior Princess,1.0,,"I tried getting hot coffee out of this machine for 3 days of reading the manual as well as online troubleshooting trying to figure out how to adjust the temperature. I finally broke down and contacted Hamilton Beach directly. They said they'd send me a new one, but I would have to ship them this one first at my cost before they would ship me a new one AT MY COST. Nope. Returned."
"October 5, 2020",Jim,1.0,,"Purchased this in May 2020. Had a previous version of this item, worked very well for years. This model keeps the coffee hot, which I liked, but the plastics used to fabricate the  brew tank could not support the temperature and failed at the heating plate causing a slow leak at 4 months, and then a complete failure at 5 months. You can no longer purchase the replacement brew tank (part# 990145100)anywhere, so I suspect that this is an issue with this model of brew station. Beware the model 47900.... stay away."
"December 17, 2020",cates,1.0,,Bought this pot less than a year ago and it has already broke. Called support and they have shut down the phone lines due to COViD.  So you have to email them. Not heard a thing from them. I have bought from them before and never had a problem with the other products.  Don't recommend buying this product at all.
"May 12, 2020",Barb,3.0,,"I'm sorry I gave this a try.  This looks nice, is easy to operate.  Coffee is ok, but once I get down to 2 cups of coffee it will burn what is left in the maker.  So I either turn the maker off and reheat the last cups or just put down the drain.  To late to return, so this will be in the next yard sale."
"October 1, 2019",sandyw43,1.0,,Bought this coffee maker had about two weeks it stopped working. They replaced the coffee maker the second one work a week or so then it stopped. Now they want 11.00 dollars to return the coffee maker. This is a Hamilton Beach brew station. More china junk.
"June 3, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Water winds up all over from the countrr to the sink even down the back, from the lid, where plug comes out I had to keep a towel under it, when cup was pressed against button coffee would come out in cup and down the wall of the unit getting all over counter and cup and tray...just a bad unit"
"September 29, 2019",Lisa Graves,3.0,,"I’ve had this coffee maker for about 3 months and from the beginning it leaks whenever you push the button to dispense coffee, coffee runs down the front of the machine and fills the catch tray, which then overflows making a mess of the counter. At first I though the leak was due to the fact I use large to go cups usually, but no, it leaks even when a smaller cup is out under the dispenser."
"August 6, 2015",B. Dow,4.0,,"This is my second order of this coffee maker (the original is going to our beach house and we wanted this one for our primary residence because we loved the first one so much)... I will say, however, this version is not quite as high quality as the first one we bought.  The bottom portion is all plastic, while the original had more of the stainless look / feel, and the water/coffee bucket portion of the maker does not seat in to the body of the coffee maker solidly and seems a little shoddy in terms of workmanship.  Lastly, this one is much noisier and even after the brew cycle is complete, it continues to sound like the coffee is brewing.  Overall, still happy with the product but definitely notice a decline in quality."
"May 6, 2021",great game!,1.0,,"It worked for a few day and after that it automatically started only making 4 cups no matter what I did. I reread the manual thinking I may have made an accidental change in the settings. Nope, I have to repeatedly restart it to brew another 1-4 cups until the pot has enough to make 2 cups of coffee! When I do, the coffee gets weaker every time I have to brew it over and over. Would not recommend I’m going to contact the seller and hopefully get my money back"
"July 7, 2019",Georgiana E Mitchell,5.0,,I have had a few Hamilton beach Brew stations but this one is a better design not as bulky and is perfect for easy clean up .. the coffee taste great and it makes iced coffee simple instructions easy set up Highly recommend this product and the price is great..
"January 9, 2020",Randy Parsons,3.0,,"It is very convenient for our family. Easy and fast to set up to brew. The 12 cups must be 6oz cups but it is great still. Now that we've been using it for a half year, it all the sudden quit working in the middle of brewing a batch, tried starting over even un-plugging and re-plug etc. even cleaned it out, can't get it to brew. The clock works and the heater seems to work."
"October 1, 2020",Pamela,3.0,,"This is my 2nd coffee maker of this kind. I love it because I'm clumsy so not having a glass canister is really nice. My old one worked but I couldn't increase the heating time and I could see the labels on the buttons (wiped off because of wear) to set timer and clock. I bought a new one but after about 5 months, the tank started to leak. Hamilton Beach has been horrible about responding to my problem. I was able to use the tank from my OLD one but it's not a solution - it's brand new. I won't buy another or ever purchase a Hamilton Beach product again."
"April 15, 2014",MBrett,3.0,,"I like a coffee maker that does not require you to fill one container and then re-pour contents into the machine. This limits my choices greatly. I also wish the manufacturers would make a coffee maker that would last longer than 1-2 years. I would be willing to pay more for for a 3-4 year warranty. Think of it as saving the land fill. This coffee maker is set up well and have had no problems. It does make very strong coffee and this is coming from someone who likes it strong. I have tried reducing the amount of coffee to reduce the strength but it is still strong. Never need the bold button. Another customer mentioned an aftertaste since the coffee does sit in a plastic container and maybe that is the issue, but just seems strong to me. It does make a small/moderate amount of noise after the coffee is made and heating in the holding tank."
"July 16, 2019",alison,5.0,,"I hated our keuirg because of the pods taking up so much room in landfills but love the convince of it! I also hate normal coffee pots filling the top with water because it always seems to make a mess. saw the water reservoir in this one so bought instantly! I honestly didn't know it was a ""brew system"" but actually really like it! dispenses coffee like a water jug!"
"May 25, 2013",TomC,5.0,One,"This is a great coffee pot (without the pot)!  Makes a delicious cup of coffee. Very hot (not Dunkin' Donuts burn your mouth hot -  just right). This is the case from the first cup you pour to the cup you have 2 hours later - just as hot and fresh. I find it easy to rinse out and clean. There is a lot of condensation if you try to open the top and clean it right away. There is a lot of ""drippage"", so open slowly (or wait til later). It is clumsy to measure and pour the water with the canister as they tell you to do, so I use a separate pitcher from the kitchen. This is not a big deal.  It makes a great small pot of coffee. I use the four cup setting for me during the week and the large setting on weekends for both my husband and I. Flavor and taste is very consistent. The pro's outweigh the con's - I love this coffee maker!!!!!!!!"
"March 23, 2018",Ski Pro 3,3.0,,"I replaced another Hamilton Beach coffee maker with this one after the first one started to leak bad.  I liked the old one better because the filter,/carafe slid out from the side and not hinged top.  This one is taller and I have to completely move it out from under the over head cupboard it sits under.  What a pain!  However, there isn't another that does, so I went with the quality if Hamilton Beach I'm familiar with. Once again, a superior product replaced with something that has poorer application."
"May 14, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,This is the 4th coffee pot I've had of Hamilton beach. This one is the worst. You can tell it wasnt put together very well. Parts are not snug. The lid broke on me after one use. Had to tape it so I could use it. I like these coffee pots so I'll have to deal with it.
"June 3, 2021",Catherine Gossett,2.0,,I totally agree with the leaking problem. It is getting worse as time goes by. Cannot find where the leak is coming from. It is the second  Hamilton Beach coffee maker I have bought and find the same problem. Will do my research and order a different brand next time.
"February 1, 2021",Lorraine Y,1.0,,Purchased as a Christmas gift and the thing has been on ever since! It doesn’t cut off! You can here this thing running all day and night! The coffee tastes bitter from being on way past 2 hours selected to keep warm! It doesn’t brew “just” 1 to 4 cups! The heating plate inside scorches because it stays on continuously so scrubbing it everyday is a MUST! It is a waste of coffee and money!  I wish I had known before the return window expired I would’ve sent it back and got my money back!
"April 10, 2020",R E,4.0,,"This is the 3rd Brewmaster I have purchased.  The first two had lasted  many years each.  I like the fact this model went back to the 4 hour 'keep warm' feature.  the 2 hours on my last one was not enough.  The only thing I'm disappointed in is that this model leaks onto my counter  all the time.  I've only had this one almost 3 mos, so I'll have to see if it gets worse over time."
"April 2, 2019",LS,2.0,,"Noisy , constantly sizzles while on,  maybe 12 very very small cups.  It was only $39. so not a huge loss.  I have replaced it with the one with the glass pot and has an individual cup maker on the side.  So far so good with it but it only keeps coffee hot 2hrs."
"November 14, 2019",DL,1.0,,"After a month or so of using the brew station we noticed it wasn’t brewing with all the water. We had to turn it on and off multiple time in order to brew all 12 cups. We then started brewing with the top of the part where the water is held, open. With the top open it brewed all 12 cups. After a week of brewing our coffee this way, it stopped brewing all 12 cups again and we were back to square one. I would not recommend buying this brew station. Unfortunately it’s been over the allotted time to return it. It’s a waste of money."
"September 22, 2020",B Deluso,1.0,,This coffee maker must have been returned once before. Face of  the water line falling off & a bunch of glue on it. The other side loose ......my husband opened & threw everything away so may not be able to return it. Leaks & very noisy...... This is the second time I've sent but haven't heard back.
"June 28, 2016",Gordon R Sallee,4.0,,"I love this product for its ease of use.  One problem I have is it seems to boil the coffee continuously even after the brew cycle.  I'm not sure if this is a fault or Hamilton Beach intended to continue the temperature at such a high temp.  The blue light is very bright on the display.  It lights my entire kitchen at night when all other lights are out.  Too strong of a light, but the ease in which I dependence the coffee, clean the maker and make the coffee from scratch cannot be better. The initial setup was a breeze.  I really like this coffee maker."
"March 8, 2021",Texas buyer,1.0,,We had previously owned 2 Hamilton Beach coffee makers of this type and liked them. THIS one leaked from the first day we used it.  We returned it and bought a Cuisenart one from a local store at twice the priie but it doesn't leak.
"December 16, 2017",Marie B,5.0,,"Wanted a simple, basic coffeemaker but wasn't sure how I felt about the lack of a pot. Had nothing to worry about. This is basic but smart enough to set the morning brew time the night before. Holds 12 cups and can keep them warm for up to 4 hours. Takes normal filters, easy to clean, and I may never need to go back to a pot after using the handy button. Would recommend or buy as a gift!"
"June 21, 2019",Laniah Robey,5.0,,I bought this for my husband after the pot got broken on his last one. I love that there is no pot with this one. That the carafe keeps the coffee hot. I can take out the filter compartment for easy rinsing and I can remove the water tank to fill up directly under the faucet. I love this!
"April 5, 2020",Craig A.,3.0,,"I liked this product, until coffee stopped flowing easily from the pour lever.  After multiple cleanings, i still cant get my coffee out of this machine and am dumping it.  Also, it brews at a low tempature and coffee needs to be microwaved to be at a hot temp.  This is probably why coffee lasks some flavor. I loved that there was no pot to break, but there is a reason competitors dont produce a model like this with a pour lever instead of carafe. Decent coffee maker if you only need it to work for a year."
"August 27, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"We had a Keurig for about a year. At first it was nice because of all the different k cups you can buy, but after the hype runs out you realize they are expensive. Also, they never make a full coffee cup full of coffee. Since purchasing this coffee maker we haven't used the Keurig at all. I love how it keeps the coffee in the reservoir and not a carafe. It's also a tall enough dispenser to put a travel mug under. The one downfall is it does take a little more time to brew coffee then the Keurig. But overall is a great product!"
"February 19, 2021",Mickenzie Lockwood,2.0,,Leaks. Also more of a pain to clean than a regular coffee maker but not too terrible. If I had to do again I’d have purchased something different. We just thought this would be cool with the dispenser but it’s really not convenient.
"July 18, 2019",Judy W,4.0,,"I like that it keeps the coffee hot for 4 hours. If my husband had not already discarded the box after I tasted the 1st cup of coffee,  I would have sent it back.  It tasted like the plastic it is made from.  I had cleaned it well, ran water through it a could times before I used it.  It has gotten better, but it is just not the same as a glass decanter.  Luckily it is close to my sink and I can use my sprayer to put water in it. If it gets turned off after it finishes, you have to take filter and container full of hot coffee out and add a little water to the tank to get it to come back on or it will tell you to add water."
"May 22, 2021",Tracy Lambert,1.0,,"Have had this unit a little over a month.. Machine brews fine, but has started to leak from the brewed coffee reservoir. Leaks down inside the machine and out the bottom encasement to the countertop. We've cleaned the machine, ensured the there's no buildup on the brew area, below the reservoir, etc. It appears the reservoir just leaks. Have to clean coffee from the counter every brew. Not really what we expected from a brand new coffee machine."
"May 27, 2013",Alvin,5.0,,"Makes excellent coffee. Programmable ""Keep Warm"" feature is an exceptional option that is very useful. The push button dispense feature makes getting a cup of coffee very convenient - no carafe to drip on the hot plate (no hot plate exists) or counter. The tall dispensing area height makes coffee cup size a non issue when getting coffee. The digital display stays backlit and is sufficiently sized to be easy to read and makes programming a breeze. The programmable regular, ""Bold"" and 1-4 cups brewing feature is also very handy. This makes brewing a small pot of coffee work very well as well as a strong or regular pot to suit your taste. The brew basket does tend to drip a little more than some coffee makers when disposing of the coffee grounds from the last pot but is easily controlled. Both the water tank and the brewed coffee holder are clearly marked so that getting the right amount of water for brewing is exceptionally easy.  I do, however, prefer to fill the water tank with a mug rather than the large coffee holder."
"January 28, 2021",Tom L.,5.0,,Used a machine like this a few years ago while on vacation immediately came home and bought one. Best Coffee Maker in the world. No more glass pots no mess. just put your cup up to the machine press and BAM coffee comes out. Just Fantastic  Cannot go wrong  100 % recommend .... Had to replace the one from a few years ago and bought the same model again..  Coffee never tasted so good...  Good Morning to you as well....
"October 17, 2019",Casey,5.0,,This Hamilton Beach Brew Station is far better than my previous one.  I love the side container for the water.  There are no drips on the counter when lifting the lid to add coffee or to clean.  So glad I got this one.
"November 7, 2019",Nick/Peart,1.0,,This is an update. I now had this coffee maker for 8 months. It stinks. The coffee doesn't come out strong. It taste very watered down. It also uses up a lot of coffee.  I had to buy another one and this time I'm staying away from Hamilton beach. I bought a ninja. Don't buy this coffee maker.
"March 9, 2020",Margaret Vander Vloedt,4.0,,"After my second time purchasing this...... I found that after a couple weeks, it didn’t brew all the water that I had put in. After cleaning, it worked better but I had to turn the coffee maker on and off to do so. I was disappointed with the second time purchasing the product, I have to say. All I want it for all of my coffee to brew when I press a button. I should add, that I had the first one for 3 years before and rarely gave me any trouble. The buttons just malfunctioned."
"March 2, 2021",Colleen Broomfield,4.0,,"This is my second maker. I love it. The reason for not giving 5 stars is the filter recommended when purchasing. It doesn't fit. The lid will not fully close, and heat and steam will escape. So buy the maker, skip the filter."
"October 10, 2015",Amazon Customer,1.0,3,Within a week of buying this coffee pot I would come into my kitchen and see coffee all over the counter top - not just water as it seems others have experienced with this pot. I think something is defective with the mechanism that dispenses coffee into a cup so that if any coffee at all is left in the holding tank it leaks all over the counter after a period of time.  I failed to keep the original packaging so I can't send it back to Amazon.  Guess I am stuck with it.  I did look at some of the reviews before buying but they were very mixed - some loved it and had no problems while others hated it.  I decided to try it.  I definitely should have listened more to those who said it was terrible.  I would not recommend this pot at all.
"September 21, 2019",Taylor,5.0,,"I have had Kurigs and regular coffee makers as well as super expensive coffee makers but this one is my favorite. I love waking up to hot coffee ready to go and I am a slow drinker so it keeps it warm inside the machine for me for four hours, which is awesome because there is no coffee pot that my toddler can reach up on the counter and drop on the floor."
"August 1, 2015",Sean Tanner,5.0,2,"My previous maker, also a HB (without the detachable reservoir), was still working when I felt the need to replace it with this one. I read the reviews, after I saw a friend of mine had one, and was surprised to see some of the problems people are having with it. The things that concerned me the most were leaking and that the coffee is not hot. I went for it anyway, with faith that it would still be better than what I had. Manufactured machines, no matter what they are, have a failure rate off the line. I am happy to say that, although some have had these kinds of issues with their makers, ours is working excellently and I'm excited to not have to dump the old coffee only to pour clean water into the same, cracked hopper, to have to pour it into the maker. This reservoir is SO MUCH NICER! The only thing this one does that has any level of annoyance is, when it is still on after the brewing is done, it continues to have a crackling sound. But guess what? That means the coffee is, wait for it...HOT! It automatically brewed at 5:45 am and I didn't get any until just after 7am. Almost immediately after dispensing it into a cup, I almost couldn't pick up the cup because it was that hot. You should also know that the lights on the display and the buttons are a bit brighter than the other machines, so it is not recommended for those who sleep in the same room as their coffee makers. I only got this a few days ago, so perhaps over time I will have problems with it, but so far, our daily coffee experience just got way better. And I couldn't find any other dispensing machines other than from HB, unless I wanted to get an industrial Bunn maker. No thanks."
"August 19, 2016",R.A.M.,1.0,8,"Update: I bought this July 2016 and as of April 2017 it's still working, sort of, but the brewing quality has steadily gone down hill and my wife will no longer drink it. I can only stand it because I put cream and sugar in it. So it was $50 wasted. My initial impression was negative. Our previous coffee makers were over $100 and very good quality but they were only lasting about 5 years, same as the cheap coffee makers so we decided to spend less this time. The Hamilton Beach feels rickety in comparison. When you pick it up or move it, the flimsy plastic feels like it's going to collapse. The coffee is not as hot as I'd like but is adequate, about drinking temperature; hot enough to melt sugar and just hot enough to melt powdered creamer. What I like is how you add water, coffee, and the dispensing mechanism. The latter took a little getting used to, at first I dismissed it as a gimmick but my wife loves it and it has grown on me. The removable coffee bucket with warmer has a lot of corners and crannies for something that needs to be washed regularly. It was clearly designed for the convenience of the factory and designers with little thought to the end user. Some reviewers complained of dribbling but we haven't had any problems like that. There are (or should be) 3 rubber feet on the bottom to prevent sliding but one of mine was missing and a 2nd was loose in the box and won't stay on no matter what so the coffee maker slides around if you don't hold it still. The coffee is good. It tasted different than our old coffee maker but after getting used to it I like it."
"September 4, 2018",K. Fredrick,5.0,,"This is the second one I have owned! The first one lasted a good five years. The iced coffee option is great and is the reason I bought the exact same one! Easy to clean with some white vinegar run through the machine. I love way the coffee dispenses by pushing your cup against the bar. The first machine probably would have lasted longer than five years, but some days we use it 2+ times a day! The display is nice and bright as well."
"February 23, 2021",cassandra,1.0,,"My mom wanted me to purchase this for her and when she received it she was not happy. The hole where the brewed coffee comes out that is part of the bucket/coffee filter holder does not match with the hole the that is part of the coffee maker. When she places her coffee cup under and presses the button most of the coffee goes into the machine and spews onto the counter, instead of going into the cup. My mom has major health issues to her spine/arms and should not be lifting anything but she has to everyday just to clean underneath the coffee pot."
"September 15, 2015",Kindle Customer,5.0,One,"I have had mine for almost a year now and can not be happier! I had an older model for several years and was upset when it finally gave out. I was worried by some of the reviews that said it leaked, but I am very glad I took a chance and purchased it anyway. It is programmable and very easy to clean. Unlike the older version that made you fill the container and then pour it into the machine, this one makes it easy by allowing you to just fill the reserve. It is tall though, so to put in the filter and coffee I do have to pull it out from under my cupboard. I like that during the summer I can make ice coffee at home and decide how sweet I want it. I personally make a full pot and then pour it into a pitcher, mixing what I want into it. Oh, and I have NOT had any trouble with the machine leaking."
"September 24, 2019",Linda McDougall,1.0,,I am so disapointed. This is the 2nd one I bought in a 5 year period. I would think that a coffee pot for a home would last longer than an average of 2 years.  I called Hamilton Beach and was basically that everyday use is not recommended for quality assurance. it's a sad day when a company that has been around for so many years no longer takes pride in their products.
"October 23, 2018",blowndisk,2.0,One,"Liked: Timer, keep warm feature, temperature and flavor of brewed coffee. Disliked: Not easy to thoroughly clean coffee sedimant from tank. Dispensing spout broke in an open position releasing the coffee all over the place while brewing. (Broke after 17 months of use; Manufacturer warranty is 12 months....)"
"June 8, 2017",USA Patriot,5.0,One,"I absolutely love this pot and its ease of operation.  No cleanup, no mess, just a clear cup of coffee.  However, the measurements are way off.  Twelve cups measured in the pot = 7 cups of water.  No big deal, as there are only two of us, but for big coffee drinkers, it could be a problem.  I still give it 5 stars because it's so easy and clean to use."
"December 6, 2019",Faye Kuwamoto,5.0,One,"Love this coffee, maker. So simple, a lot nicer than the last one. This is number 2. Easy to use n makes excellent coffee."
"October 6, 2016",Jocelyn Doddridge,4.0,One,"This is the first time I've used a brewing station like this.  I really like that there's no pot to have to deal with.  The machine works really well, and I love that there is ""Bold"" option as my husband and I prefer stronger coffee.  The only negative I have about it right now is that my travel mug that I bring to work every day doesn't fit.  I can tilt it, but it's much harder to watch it fill up that way.  It's just a minor thing, and I make it work anyway."
"August 1, 2014",Wanetadrift,3.0,,Does the job.  Have to wait til it is done brewing to get a hot cup of coffee so be patient.  Like that you can adjust Keep Warm stage from 2-4 hrs.  and then shuts off.  Only had a few weeks so so far so good.  Easy to clean.  Replaced an older Hamilton Brew station and paid higher price but it was made with better and sturdier stuff.  This unit is a bit more delicate so time will tell.  You get what you pay for.  This is better for the occasional coffee drinker but if you are hard core drinker you would be better off investing in the upgraded brew station. Love the fact that you need no glass pot that is a plus.  My husband states that you need both hands to push the coffee cup against the pour bar cause his cup keeps slipping off of it when he pours - could be a man thing..lol
"February 22, 2013",The Andersen,5.0,,"2015 review: I just purchased this coffee maker to replace the exact same coffee maker I purchased in 2013. Used every single day (except vacations) for almost 3 years. It would still be working good today if I didn't drop it in a sink full of water while I was washing it. My fault, not the coffee makers. This coffee maker makes a VERY good cup of coffee. I grind my beans and use the bold setting creating the best cup of joe possible in this price range.  I would give it 6 stars if I could. 2013 review: This is the perfect coffee maker for our house.  During the week I set the programmed start at night and at 6am I get my cup of perfectly brewed coffee and about an hour later my wife gets her cup of perfectly brewed coffee.  The internal post-brewed coffee storage doesn't burn the coffee on the bottom like an external carafe style coffee maker does."
"July 24, 2019",J SHAFER,5.0,,"Love the programmable feature, my husband has fresh, hot coffee ready for him before work each morning and I can set it for him anytime the day before! Also love the bold feature to get that stronger coffee taste and color from any kind of coffee!"
"October 21, 2011",Rob P.,4.0,One,"I like this coffee maker a lot, so I will list only things that could be improved. I have been using it for a month now. The time setting buttons are always live, and easy to bump into and change settings accidentally. The coffee does taste fresh a long time, but never gets hot enough for me. It fills your cup slowly, and it is not easy to see the level in your cup as it pours. The basin is difficult to hand-clean due to multiple protrusions and corners. This is a tall machine, and the lid is permanently attached, so you must pull it out from the counter to open or pour in water. Filling the upper basin with water to pour into the bottom is not easy from my water bottle tap - angles and handle do get in the way, but this would likely not be a problem for most people. Filling the lower basin is blocked by the heating element, and may splash out, and the sides of the lower section are in the way of the upper as you try to complete the pour - a nuisance. As others have mentioned, the fill level for water and coffee is critical. You cannot overfill either. If you do not settle the coffee in the filter it may get up onto the lid, which is part of the dispersion system for the hot water, and that is hard to clean off without being able to easily remove. As I said, I like this pot a lot. The above is mostly minor points that I would appreciate the manufacturer to address for future models. The ability to have decent coffee 4 hours after it is made is great. And for those who are wondering about operation; the lid opens up and back, the filter basket is sitting on top, the top section is a bucket that you fill with water and pour into the lower section. From there it is perked back to the upper section through the lid and is kept warm for serving."
"August 11, 2018",gramma10x's,5.0,,"I think this may be our third or fourth purchase of one of these.....after breaking glass carafes on other types of coffee pots, we enjoy the ease of filling or mug from the machine.  Wish it had a bit more weight as to not move around on counter but that's probably the only issue.  We have bought a few as we have two locations that require coffee pots."
"February 20, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,I’ve had this since December and it’s started leaking everywhere. I think when it’s able to sit on for 2 or 4 hrs it slowly melts the plastic. Also the insulation piece under the container that holds the coffee is encrusted with burnt coffee that’s leaked through and it smells terrible through the house. My mom bought one before me and had to throw hers away as well because it just quit working. I cleaned it routinely. Going back to standard coffee pot.
"October 12, 2015",frenchpete,3.0,8,"I purchased this coffee maker in January of 2014 and have been using it for almost 2 years....here is what I can tell you: Thumbs up first: 1 - It makes good coffee. 2 - I like no carafe. 3 - It brews quite fast. 4 - I like the options to make coffee stronger. 5 - I like the iced coffee function. 6 - It has always worked properly from day one. 7 - Overall, it's just a marginally 'ok' machine. Now, the thumbs ""sideways and/or down"": 1 - The plastic bar you depress to dispense the coffee must be pressed quite firmly, this means you must hold the back of the machine to keep it from sliding backward on the counter top (unless the machine is resting against the counter top back splash for support). 2 - And why didn't they include a small led under/near the cup dispenser so you could see how full your cup was in a dark kitchen, before it spilled over? 3 - The heating element makes noise in the keep warm stage.  And also, it continues to cook the coffee until the element cycles off! Not good. 4 - Water will gather into the two areas/wells next to the keep warm module.  This is from the steam created from the normal brewing cycle.  If you don't manually sponge this water out of there after a certain number of cycles, the machine WILL leak.  I'm not sure how this problem could be solved but it definitely IS a poor design issue with this machine. 5 - The rubber coating on the 'on/off' button is wearing off; not a huge deal but still..... Bottom line: the perfect coffee maker is still waiting to be designed............I haven't found it yet! Update 4/26/2016: THERE IS NO WAY TO GET AROUND THAT THIS PRODUCT WILL LEAK.  EVERY 5TH BREW OR SO, YOU MUST REMOVE THE HOLDING TANK AND MANUALLY SPONGE OUT THE WATER WHICH COLLECTS IN WELLS BESIDE THE WARMING PLATE.  A BAD DESIGN!"
"February 28, 2020",LA22,4.0,,"I really like this brand and style of coffee maker it is the second one that I have owned it is easy to operate, and convenient. I think the first one lasted me about 5 years hoping this one goes a little longer but it does not seem as sturdy as the first."
"May 31, 2016",Jenifer Fellers,4.0,One,"The first one I got the automatic start button did not work, however Amazon shipped me a new one and it does work now. The first time I made coffee I filled the water reservoir all the way up and programmed the buttons for 1-4 cups, it brewed all the water. That's the only complaint I have, however I learned to just fill the water up for how much coffee you'll want at a time. You can program it keep the coffee hot for up to 4 hrs. I read reviews before I bought mine and a few said that they had a hard time figuring out how hard to push the bar to get coffee and that sometimes the coffee would run down the back of the machine, I did not have this issue. I put my cup to the bar and I use my finger to push the bar. Works like a charm."
"January 4, 2014",Sedona,4.0,,"Here's my initial impression after two uses: Really like the no-carafe style. Easy to dispense into various sized mugs. No spills. Inner container keeps coffee very warm for a couple hours--not piping hot, but perfect drinking temp without having to nuke it in microwave. Negative: Coffee is weak. I'm using exactly the same coffee-to-water ratio as with my last coffee maker, and the Brewstation produces much weaker coffee, even on the Bold setting. I'm currently using the permanent Hamilton Beach 80675 gold filter and I was using paper filters in the other machine, so this might be part of the problem. The gold filter doesn't fill the brew basket--small gap all the way around. Will try paper filters and see if there's a difference."
"August 11, 2017",Elizabeth McCracken,4.0,One,"I really like this coffee maker. I will never go back to the regular style. But, I don't like how wet everything gets from taking the ""water basket"" (not sure of real name) out, or when you pour the water into the resevoir, it gets everywhere for some reason. The way the water basket is shaped, you just can't pour the water in without water dripping everywhere. That's just a nuisance, has nothing to do with how well the machine works."
"June 19, 2019",Jeri Maxwell,3.0,,"We purchased this to replace the same machine we purchased the last 3 times over the last 10 years due to it leaking. Unfortunately this new machine, after, a few days, is once again leaking from what appears to be underneath.  Very disappointed but not enough to hassle with returning it. I wish Hamilton Beach would fix this problem since it seems we are not the only ones experthis problem. Otherwise we love this machine!"
"June 9, 2020",Adrianna L. Stiemsma,1.0,,"Great coffee maker until it stopped working. I've had this for 5 months and it just stopped working, bo power going to it. I've tried multiple plugs, let it cool off while unplugging and still nothing. I cleaned it as instructions said. Pretty disappointed, I purchased this as a replacement to one just like it i had for 6 years before I accidentally broke a part trying to clean. This one just not like the old one."
"May 12, 2017",Agent_Cooper,5.0,,"I bought it to be our ""camping coffee maker""...not having a glass carafe I figured it would be easy to pack into a tub with the rest of our camping stuff. It was cheap and plastic and I didn't expect much from it other than that it would be good enough for camping (we usually stay at camp sites where power is available). But I've been pleasantly surprised! It actually makes great coffee! It's easy to clean and stays nice and warm inside the machine."
"August 28, 2016",Matt,1.0,5,"Terrible coffee maker. Weirdly pieced together. It's a complex process every time you want to make coffee or clean up. Cute idea but eliminating the coffee pot only creates problems and dirties other parts. I wouldn't not buy this again. Update (24SEP16) - Dispenser stopped working. Coffee just trickles out of the spout. Have to remove the coffee reservoir to pour out, exactly like a normal coffee pot, but way more complicated. This thing is terrible."
"June 9, 2020",Furphy,2.0,,"Love how easy this is to clean and set up for the morning. That being said, I had this for about 5 weeks when the tank started leaking all over the counter. I missed the 30 day return window. Might as well have thrown money in the trash.  Would not recommend."
"May 13, 2021",George,1.0,,"I bought this coffee maker back in September 2020.  I got because of the concept.  I love the idea of getting one cup at the time.  Initially, my complaint was that the coffee did not get hot enough.  Now,  the coffee maker doesn't work at all.  The coffee doesn't come out.  It seems to be clog some where.  The machine is less than a year old.  great idea, great look but performers like an italian car."
"May 3, 2020",boog,5.0,,"Makes really hot  coffee. Love that you don’t have to pour and spill, lol. Makes 12 cups in just a couple of minutes. Looks nice on my coffee station. Easy to clean outside and the removable parts I put in the dishwater."
"November 21, 2019",Amanda M.,4.0,,"We go through coffee pots like crazy and really like this one but it needs a little improvement... Leaks a little bit of coffee from the bottom.  The inside of the machine stains easily, but it is very easy to operate and clean.  The coffee does stay hot and tastes good.  It doesn't take up lots of counter space which is nice."
"March 27, 2021",BJ Lewis,5.0,,"I've been using this product for years, replacing as necessary. I love the fact that the brewed coffee is always consistently good. When I am at home alone, I love the fact that I can turn off the heat and enjoy the coffee over a day or two, reheating in the microwave, with no burnt smell or taste."
"March 18, 2021",Katie Ryan,1.0,,The water reservoir leaks everywhere but there’s no fix & no way to anticipate when it’ll happen or why so you have to stand & wait to see if it’s leaking or risk waking up to  water all over your counter & mud for coffee.
"July 2, 2020",Dave Smith,3.0,,"This is the 3rd Brewmaster coffee maker I’ve owned - I really like the whole concept of it. Of course, they will wear out over time and develop some minor issues. This new one came with a leak at the spout when filling a cup - it runs down the backside of the reservoir into the overflow grate and fills it up rather quickly. While I wish it didn’t leak, I put a paper towel pad in ever morning to absorb coffee that drains into it. If this maker didn’t have this fault I would give it a 5-star rating - still like the way it brews my coffee."
"March 6, 2016",SamK,5.0,,Had this coffee maker for a few weeks now and. We are loving it. It's so easy to set up and use. We have been saving a ton of money from not buying coffee at the store. Brewing is real easy and I love the fact that there is no glass pot. It has the tank built in and it dispenses the coffee like a soda machine does. You press the cup against the tab under the spout and all the coffee you can dream of comes flowing out. It's easy to clean and use and requirements use. The hardest part is finding the perfect coffee grounds. We DID NOT receive this coffee pot for anything other than our hard earned money.
"March 16, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I like the fact that I can remove the water tank from the system to fill it for making coffee - it's a great innovation! It's very easy to clean, keeps the coffee at the right temperature and allows for strong or mildly brewed coffee to suit my taste. It's a top ;oader, so be sure that you have a place for it that allows for you to open the top for the coffee grounds and removing the tank for cleaning. Other than that, this is a real winner!"
"August 10, 2015",Gary,1.0,2,"Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Coffee Maker, Programmable Brewstation Summit Dispensing Coffee Machine (48464)   This has been my worst coffee pot ever.  I tried different grind coarseness, different filters, various brew settings (normal and bold).  Every pot of coffee tasted like it had burned.  I could hear the coffee simmering in the pot as if it was gently boiling.  I read some reviews that the coffee maker wasn't making coffee hot enough.  Maybe Hamilton Beach tried to correct this problem.  The coffee was VERY hot.  The coffee was bitter and tasted like it had been over heated.  It even smelled like it was burned.  It didn't matter whether the coffee was poured as soon as it had brewed or if it had sat in the pot for a while; the coffee tasted bad either way. I wish I could give it less than one star. Do yourself a favor and look for another pot."
"August 17, 2019",Samantha Kearney,1.0,One,This is the 4th coffee maker like this we’ve purchased. It seems the same problems always occur with these but our latest has two big problem after a week of use. First the rubber skid stops on the bottom continually pull on when we move. But the worst is that it leaks water and coffee out the bottom. We have to wipe down the counter both after using and after refilling. It’s a real pain that usually didn’t happen with our others until after a few years of use. Our last one lasted 3 years and at the end coffee would barely drip out even after cleaning between use.
"March 10, 2021",Jeri Ann Meade,1.0,,Our old Hamilton beach coffee maker broke right before the holidays and this was the closest one I could find. It is awful. Everyday it leaks all over our counter . I can not return it because it’s out of the return window . Do not buy this product. We are getting white counter tops soon and will not be able to use this because it could  stain.it is a large amount that leaks as well .  I have no choice but throw it away . It was a huge waste of money.
"December 18, 2012",JPizzle,5.0,,"We have tried several other coffee makers and keep coming back to this one!  Even other family members love theirs.  The ease of not having to worry about a glass carafe (especially with kids running around the house) is definitely awesome, not to mention no exterior heated parts (burner under carafe on normal coffee makers) keeps little hands and fingers safe.  We love the speed, quality of coffee it produces, as well as all of its automatic features.  These coffee makers DO require normal maintenance that carafe coffee makers dont, but a simple spray of the ""storage"" container with some bleach, and removing and cleaning the interior stainless steel filter (keeps any grinds that do escape the paper filter out of your cup! : )  It will be brewing wonderful coffee for you for years to come...just like our last one did (Started leaking after we put it in the dishwasher)."
"July 20, 2019",Steven Cabral,2.0,,"This coffee maker is not easy to program and just when you think you did it right it doesn’t brew. Also, coffee is not hot enough and makes a very weak flavored coffee. I would’ve returned it except I threw the box away as soon as I opened it thinking that I would love a coffee maker. But I don’t love the coffee maker. I’ll just stick to my French press."
"June 26, 2021",diane,3.0,One,"This is my third hamilton beach coffee maker in as many years.  They are never moved and cleaned regularly, but nonetheless, start to leak and it seems to take over a minute to get a full cup off coffee from the canister.  This package arrived damaged and the metal on the from has several dents.  Rats."
"April 25, 2021",Carrie,5.0,,"This will be the third Hamilton Beach Coffee maker I've bought.  And actually, I haven't even unpacked this one yet.  I got the second one back to working, so this new one will stay in storage until needed."
"July 13, 2021",David Sneed,4.0,,This is my third coffee maker that I had and they sre great for great tasting coffee and to keep it warm for 4 hours and not burn it. The only thing is that the drain eventually quits working no matter how clean you keep it.
"November 24, 2015",Marcia,1.0,One,"Love the Design of the coffee brew stations.  The product works great for hot and iced coffee.  The problem is I hate having to unplug and drain condensation water build up under the filter and coffee dispenser container after EVERY USE. Hamilton Beach needs to seriously take care of this design flaw. It is just such a hassle to drain the condensation water every day, if you do not drain by the second day of use your counter top will have water all over it. I have tried to use paper towel to absorb the water but it takes 5-6 sheets, such a waste."
"April 6, 2019",Jill,1.0,One,"From day one, the spout was awful.  It was an incredibly slow pour which makes grabbing a cup of coffee into a 5 minute ordeal.  What happened after the slowness was the constant spilling of the coffee.  The coffee coming from the spout stopped pouring in its regular way and started to hug the side of the coffeemaker and pour all over my kitchen counter.  This happens EVERY TIME now.  I have to pour for 3 seconds, then pull of, and repeat.  Otherwise the coffee gets everywhere.  It's a constant annoyance and I'll be throwing this piece of garbage in the trash once I go back to a carafe model soon."
"August 8, 2014",cycles100,4.0,,"makes coffee like the previous model.  enjoy the water fill reserve comes out easily and has the cup markings on it. this model is wider and wish the designers put the water reserve on the back and squared it rather than making the maker wider.  takes up more counter space. also, the previous model ""beeped"" when the process was complete.  this model doesn't beep. UPDATE: After 4 months the only flaw we're finding is that the non-drip will LEAK.  We're disappointed.  When we have coffee remaining and leave for work in the morning, we will come home to a puddle of coffee under the maker that overflows the drip tray. We now dump whatever is left when we have our morning cups and fill our in-car cups.  If not, we get to clean up the dripped coffee when we get home.  It's fun."
"September 9, 2016",Amy G.,5.0,One,"Our previous coffee maker developed an issue with the carafe and we've decided to explore an option that has the coffee collected in a tank and avoids having a carafe altogether. We have not regretted this decision! Having the tank on top does make the unit a bit bulky so you'll need to make sure the spot where you are planning to store it in has sufficient space. This coffee maker was very easy to setup and configure. We've owned some that had multiple levels of menus and required software development skills to program. Not with this unit. You can easy select between Normal, Bold, and 1-4 cups options. Setting the duration during which coffee will be kept hot is a one button push. Coffee is kept sufficiently hot and doesn't require microwaving to get to the right temperature. One of our favorite features is delayed brewing / timer. I usually set it up in the evenings, push one button and wake up to a wonderful coffee aroma. The unit uses 8"" round filters. If you've never used this type of coffee maker (w/o carafe), you'll need to read the instructions on how to fill it up with water (you will need to remove both the coffee basket and the tank for coffee collection, then fill up the water tank). Coffee brewed in this maker tastes wonderful. Does not have the ""plasticy"" taste produced by some other makers. Would highly recommend."
"January 10, 2021",Marne Bailey,3.0,,"This is the third brew station that I have purchased, I used the previous ones until they were done and loved them. This is the first one with the new design.  I am not a fan, it is almost impossible to get the water into the lower basin without getting it everywhere all over my counter.  I miss the separate water basin on the side that my previous one had.  Additionally, when I dispense the coffee after brewing it drops out after I am done and makes a mess.  I may cut my losses and order a different one or try to pick up one of the older models that I loved if I can find one."
"December 25, 2019",C. Allred,3.0,,"This was a gift for my husband.  It works great, except the setting for how much coffee to make at one time doesn't work (set for 4 cups, made all 12). Only used once, so going to reset everything and set if that fixes the issue."
"June 17, 2017",Doris,4.0,,"I bought this coffee maker 15-16 months ago, and now the programmable option stopped working.  Unfortunately, the warranty is only for 1 year and you cover the costs for sending it back to/from Hamilton Beach according to their website. It's also starting to drip and run all over the drip pan, table, cup/floor as it is almost done filling my travel mug. Other than that, when it was still working, it worked beautifully.  Loved the programmable option and ability to change the warm settings from 1,2, or 4 hrs. I liked the option to choose between bold and regular, although I didn't personally notice a difference.  Easy to use. A little harder to clean the filter where you put the paper filter due to the very thin slits.  It made it tedious to clean with a green sponge to get in between each crevice."
"December 31, 2019",sal,4.0,,"We love the coffee brewer.  This was purchased to replace one we have had for some time.  The new one leaked water.  It was replaced very quickly and the replacement is fine, I would rate the brewer a five if it weren't for the need to replace it, and the fact that it and the replacement were shipped in the manufacturer's box.  As expected, both boxes showed the results of handling before delivery.  The item should have been shipped in another box with padding."
"December 5, 2019",I delph,2.0,,Was happy at first because it's easy to use and clean.  But after a few uses the part were the water drips into the coffee stopped working and it spewed hot water out like crazy if you opened the lid to fix it when it made an awful noise due to no water coming through during the brew process...i returned it.
"May 30, 2019",Yadira,3.0,,I loved this coffee maker when I first received it but after a couple of months of use it has stopped brewing. I will fill it up with the desired amount of water but only half the water gets used. We have to turn it off/on again for the leftover water to empty out of the reservoir. I have tried twice contacting customer service with Hamilton Beach but I just end up waiting on hold for over 1hr each time. I did leave my call back number and a message but I still haven’t heard from them.
"June 12, 2021",Olive J. Dempsey,5.0,,"I love having 12 cups of tea available in a few minutes. It is for coffee also, but I only drink ice coffee which it also makes. Love love love no bitter taste at the end of the 12 cups. A great product for little money."
"June 3, 2014",Prof. Docwell,5.0,One,"I had very good luck with my previous HB brew station, but it was the model without the side loading tank. The new model works great!!! But, I don't really see the need for the side tank as the top poor system worked just fine. Maybe if a person is short this might be better for them to use. The footprint on the countertop is a little bit larger, but the results still are a great cup of coffee. Special note with the last brew station I made about 350 fresh brews over a one year period. Estimating that I made about 6 cups a day that equals about 2,100 cups or over $10,500 if bought from a specialty coffee storefront shop. That's enough money for a really great vacation!!!"
"August 24, 2019",Allison,1.0,,"The button the dispense the coffee has pushed in, I have popped it back out a few times, but it goes right back in. Coffee maker now isn't usable (unless I want a huge mess), and of course I am 10 days out of my return window. I had this coffee maker, I had bought it a few years ago and it lasted this whole time..... This definitely feels like it's made cheaper now, so I'm not super surprised it doesn't work as well."
"March 17, 2021",Dara Clark,5.0,,I love this coffee maker! I have bought the same brand/type over the years. This has the water level inside so I can how many cups. Easy to use. Hamilton beach has great customer support when there is an issue.
"January 23, 2021",Linda DuBry,5.0,,The cord needs to be longer because people have upper cupboards and in order to fill it because it is tall it needs to be pulled out and the cord is not long enough I had to use an extension cord with it. Nice otherwise
"February 7, 2020",Michele,1.0,,"Omg.  This was the worst coffee maker I have ever had.  It made so much noise the whole time it was on. I had to take a plastic fork and put it between the water holder and the coffee tank.  I put up with it for a couple of weeks and I  Couldn’t deal with it any longer. Therefore, I ended up spending more money and bought another cuisinart. I should have bought another cuisinart."
"May 31, 2020",R. Kurtzman,1.0,,"We have had this model for the past 5 years, 2 pots 7 days a week it was time for replacement.  Two new units have been returned,  coffee flows out of the button that's pushed to fill your coffee cup, making a mess on the counter top.  Now on the hunt for a new coffee maker."
"February 11, 2021",Catie,5.0,,This is our 2nd coffee maker for no other reason then we wore it out after 5+years. We buy this coffee maker as a gift for others. I hope this helps others. This is hands down our favorite coffee maker we have ever bought.
"May 25, 2021",Kenneth Luster,5.0,,This is my fav because there is no carafe.  Although as the coffee sits in the holding tank the heating element does not keep it as hot as I like my coffee so I just pop it in the micro for about 40 secs.
"April 5, 2021",Bill S.,5.0,,"I love everything about this coffeemaker! Removable resovoir, push-button coffee  dispensing, ""steam catching"" design( keeps coffee from turning to mud) and the small ""keep hot"" element that doesn't burn the coffee, even after 90 minutes! By Far, the best drip coffee maker I have ever had."
"July 23, 2019",Tanya C.,2.0,One,The design of the dispenser is not very well thought out.  The machine has to be against the wall so it doesn't slide when you try to dispense the coffee.  Even when against the wall it would slip side to side.  The lids were also very flimsy.
"February 22, 2020",Colleen,2.0,,"I loved this coffee pot at first.  It was nice to not worry about a carafe that might break as we have had in the past.  Unfortunately, about a year and a half after purchasing this coffee pot, I started to notice a puddle of coffee on my counter.  At first it was every now and then, but it increased to daily.  We ended up purchasing a different coffee maker to eliminate the headache. I also found it difficult to clean the interior filter where the coffee dispenses from.  Everything else was pretty easy to clean, but this spot was difficult."
"June 24, 2013",quilterpat,4.0,,"It was at a friends house, where I noticed the coffee was brewed in a Brew Station, it was the best coffee!! It may have been due to the coffee used (Brazilian), but my attention centered on the type of coffee maker used. My friend said her particular model was several years old; she did not know the model #. After intensive research, & reading all the reviews, I decided to order model 48465, even though I'd never had a maker that large. It has been two weeks of making coffee in this model; I am pleased with this maker, it makes great coffee, keeps it hot until dispensed with no bitter taste. It is a tad difficult to see when filling with water but I am short in stature. It does take up a fair amount of counter space & clears the upper kitchen cabinets by only a couple inches.  The cord is too short to reach the outlet, so an extension cord has to be used & I dislike that feature. Accessibility to the inside for water filling is awkward & messy, again due to my height. I find it a bit difficult to clearly read water/brewed coffee levels.  I don't drink just any coffee; it has to be outstanding in taste, smooth & not bitter.  The Brew Station is growing on me, it does make excellent coffee; much of the success in making good coffee has much to do with the ground coffee & water used.  I am using filtered water, not tap water, that helps. So, despite a few negatives, I will continue testing this model.  It is a welcome switch from the Bosch Tassimo 1-cup type maker or my dependable 4-cup Mr Coffee.  Rarely will I make the full capacity of this model--as I am the lone coffee drinker (not hubby), but it will be nice to have when family visits.  I must decide if I like this model well enough versus the space it takes up on the kitchen counter.  Time will tell---------"
"April 13, 2021",Brenda Goodwin,3.0,,"1. Unsanitary to have multiple coffee drinkers refilling cups by pressing same dispenser button. Should have finger controlled button. 2. Would be very helpful to have a small light where coffee is dispensed. For cups that have dark glaze on the inner part of cup, can’t judge how much coffee is in cup. Have overfilled cups many times."
"August 19, 2020",Iris J Hogan,5.0,,"This purchase is my third Hamilton Beach Coffee maker.  I love this type of coffee maker, because I have a hand problem and can not pick up a full decanter of coffee.  The Hamilton Beach Coffee maker is so easy for me to use by just holding my cup to the button and my cup is filled."
"May 1, 2021",vickie,2.0,,"We have used this brand for years, have always loved it. Until now this one is VERY cheaply made the top cover where the grounds go in is very  flimsy.  This coffee maker feels like a kids toy. When you push your cup against it to dispense coffee it slides away, must be against the wall to stop this from happening. It has a automatic shut off in 2 hours, it burns the coffee way before that. Must make the coffee and turn it off right away to prevent burning."
"August 6, 2018",AmandaT,4.0,One,Worked great for 6 months but the coffee started to leak all over the counter. The button is a cool feature but works best with mugs. If you have styrofoam cups in your office you’ll need to press the button with your hand. Also needs to be against a wall so you have some resistance when you go to push the button. Machine is light so it tends to slide back.
"May 2, 2020",R W,2.0,,"I loved that there is no carafe, however, the entire time you have it keeping your coffee warm it is actually cooking it. By the end of 2 hours it already tastes burnt. Four hours was completely unpalatable. It also is noisy and you can hear it overcooking your coffee."
"March 26, 2021",mnmhurd,1.0,,"This coffee maker drips everywhere.  When you go to refill, the moisture build-up drips all over,  the water refill is sensitive and sloppy and leaks and the pour spout leaks after you fill your cup. I would not buy this again."
"February 13, 2020",brett,3.0,,After having this coffee maker for 3 1/2 years I'm ready for something different. The coffee comes out so slow it's painful to watch. I don't think it comes out hot enough so I was typically setting the timer an hour before I needed the coffee so it would heat up in there. Guests never know how it works and I have to explain it to them every time. Sometimes the coffee drips and makes a mess.
"February 4, 2020",Keith,5.0,One,"We’ve replaced our 5 year old Hamilton Beach 12 cupper with the same Basic model, this is an Upgrade from the old one, We Love it Totally"
"March 5, 2017",cdclark,1.0,2,"It worked okay for almost 3 months. This morning, the water would not move from the reservoir onto the coffee grounds.  It would make a couple of grumbly noises, then stopped.  I tried several times.  Unfortunately, it's too late to return this.  Waste of $40.  The other issue I had was that even after hours of sitting in the machine, the grounds never fully drained, so it was a challenge to put them in the trash without dripping coffee all over the place."
"December 4, 2020",unhappy,1.0,One,i have bought 3 of these coffeemakers and had problem with all 3.  2 of them leaked were the reservoir seats and the other one leaked  from the coffee tank
"August 12, 2016",scorpio73,5.0,One,When our coffee pot died I wanted to try a different style than a carafe styled machine and this Hamilton Beach fits that perfectly.  It did take a little while to get use to not grabbing for the carafe but this machine is so much better. You can press your mug against the button to get the coffee or press it with your finger and have the mug sitting on the drip bar. I would recommend this coffee maker.
"May 22, 2013",Gally,1.0,6,"I've had this coffeemaker for about a month and a half and make coffee twice a day and although I love the idea of this coffee maker, I hate the design. It's kinda awkward to fill and when you lift the lid to clean or make another pot, lots of water from condensation runs down all over the back of the machine even if opened slowly. Also, the coffee doesn't stay hot very long. I had to buy the grip shelf liner to keep the machine from moving while dispensing coffee. I think it's a very poorly designed coffeemaker. I use to have a Brewstation years ago and loved it, but they messed with a good thing and ruined it. I would return it, but can't because they only give you 30 days so I'm stuck with it."
"June 3, 2020",G. Briggs,4.0,,"Overall, this is a fine coffee maker. The detachable water reservoir is a bit cumbersome, making adding water to the machine a bit more difficult than I anticipated.  However, I do wish there was a way to turn off the beep it makes when the coffee is finished brewing. For whatever reason, that beep really disturbs my dog. Maybe it is similar to the beep that a shock collar makes? At any rate, I've not been able to find a way to turn that feature off."
"November 3, 2020",Thelma Thomason,3.0,,"I am on city water but, it seems to need to be cleaned to often. I had one prior to this one, I  had it several years and was on a country well water, but didn't  have that trouble with it. Thats why I bought a new one like it when it developed a leak. But not happy with this one."
"December 28, 2010",Heike,5.0,,"Well, I did expect a mediocre machine which will save me time, but I am pleasantly surprised. I have no problems fitting thick-walled coffee mugs under and also do travel mugs with no fuss. The machine makes good coffee (if you use a good coffee powder) the coffee comes out pleasantly warmth, just right not to hot. I especially like the brewing strength feature, pre-set timer, and the keep warm timer (1 to 4 hours). Now when I get up, the coffee is finished, and my day starts a lot smoother. The clean up is easy as well, I like to rinse out the coffee-storage/water measurement part after each use, just take out the filter bucket, discard of the used filter and coffee, take out the measurement/coffee storage container and rinse. Replace each part and refill for the next morning or for later that day. Hope this helps!"
"November 5, 2019",Jamie F,4.0,,"This coffee pot stores the grounds and the water in separate sections of the machine. This way, when you set it to brew in the morning, the grounds have stayed fresh and not gotten all clammy and damp like with some other pots.  The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars, is that it needs sticky feet on the bottom. it slides around on the counter too much for my liking."
"June 15, 2020",Teresa Delatorre,1.0,One,It leaks when getting coffee. It runs down in the front of the machine and in drip tray and makes a mess. I’m so disappointed. I will be returning it this week.
"May 30, 2021","Leslie, Oceanside",4.0,,Great coffee. My one big complaint is the spout on the coffee pot needs improvement. The water or coffee spills over the sides. I have to use an old measuring cup to avoid overspill adding water or pouring coffee.
"April 23, 2020",Chris Roberts,1.0,,"What a mess. I am not sure what is leaking but it creates a lake of coffee on my counter top.  The clean up required for this item is not worth the purchase. It is leaking all over my counter every time I use it. I had to place a kitchen towel under the coffee pot, until I could order a different coffee maker. I am unable to recommend this product. I contacted customer service and have not heard back about a replacement or refund for my purchase yet."
"September 9, 2019",Nana120,4.0,,I replaced an older Hamilton Beach that had served us well.  I like the removable water holder that makes filling the container easier and it keeps the coffee at a drinkable hot level.  It is quite loud while making coffee and steams up the cabinets if not pulled forward. When filling a cup it is necessary to hold the coffee maker to keep from pushing it backward.  It seems to need rubber feet or something to prevent  that from happening.
"March 26, 2020",cynthia h,5.0,,"Love this machine 4 hour option is great options of warm time 1 HR 2,3 or 4 even 0 for ice coffee. Also you don't have to brew more to turn back on. I had previous machines that required you add water to brew in order to turn back on after 2hrs."
"January 30, 2021",chebert,5.0,,I like this pot a lot.  I make a large pot every day.  I like very hot coffee and find it is not as hot as I like so I nuke my cup when I pour it.  I think it is a temperature most people like.  This is just me.
"January 3, 2014",ABS,1.0,One,"REVISED REVIEW: After about a week of use, I am returning the product.  I really wanted to like it. The coffee is not hot at all. No matter how much coffee I put in, coffee tastes weak. Amazon is wonderful for letting me return the product. ---------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: It works well for us. Really like the fact that by the time I come downstairs in the morning, coffee is already made. It turns itself off after a predetermined time so I don't have to worry about remembering to turn it off when I leave. It is great that you can dispense a cup before it is done brewing."
"February 24, 2020",Jess,4.0,,"My only complaint is that I wish there was a little light where you put the cup to fill it- when you use a travel mug you can't see when it is getting full and I have spilled a couple of times. Otherwise, great coffee maker."
"April 7, 2018",Cora,5.0,One,"This coffee maker is awesome, we love it! We have had zero issues so far. It’s a piece of cake to fill up the resivor, no more filling up the carafe and trying to pour the water in a small opening. It looks sleek, feels well built. The only negative I can find is the drip tray at the bottom when you fill your coffee, I wish it was a bit bigger/sturdier. Either way, there are so many misleading reviews for this coffee maker. Ignore them! I would buy it again and again!!!"
"December 26, 2019",Lisa Sobel,1.0,,Has leaked water from the beginning of use. Where the water tank meets the base it leaks. Will soak a medium size towel after two uses. Update: 7/26/2020. Water tank seams are now leaking all over the place. Sonic welds have failed. Do not purchase this unless you want to replace in short period of time.
"January 17, 2019",Sabrina,2.0,,"I really was excited for this coffee maker to arrive. I love the look of it. I wanted to not have to worry about a carafe or coffee pot. The first week it seemed to work pretty well, although the coffee did not get as hot as I like. Since the first week, the coffee is tasting burnt, on top of it not being very hot. I am a coffee person. I NEED a cup every day and sometimes I have 2 or 3 so a good coffee maker is important. My old coffee mate with the pot never burned my coffee and made the coffee hotter and I bought that for $20 at the most. This coffee maker was over double the price and I while it looks nice it doesn't do the job I need it too! However, I cannot afford another pot so I am stuck with this one for awhile. Wish I had not thrown the box away. If you dont mind not too hot yet slightly burnt coffee than this coffee maker is pretty to look at so it will do well. I am returning it. Gonna go with a different option with hotter coffee."
"March 11, 2016",A,5.0,,Our vintage coffee maker we loved that was actually my Grandmothers just started leaking so we needed something immediately. We went to Walmart and purchased a $50 Mr Coffee maker same day and it was terrible. We used it for 2 days until this one arrived and oh my goodness we are so happy with this! It is so awesome and the coffee tasted great from the get go! It keeps the coffee much warmer without scorching it! I would highly recommend it. My husband and I are both so happy with it and it's at a reasonable price.
"July 17, 2020",Patricia A. Pelletier,1.0,,"I've had this coffee maker for a little over a year and it started leaking like a sieve. Also,since the beginning it has made a continuous gurgling sound even after the coffee is brewed. Since it's over a year I'm stuck with it. Not good!"
"July 13, 2016",Jackie McFarlin,3.0,,"I wanted to love this coffee maker. It didn't require a carafe and dispensed coffee by the cup  while not requiring individual coffee pods. The only problem I had was that the coffee wasn't hot enough. I wanted a timer so I could set it to brew in the morning upon waking up. That worked wonderfully, but since the pot is made of plastic and only has a small heat section it just didn't brew really hot coffee. I saw that others had complained of this while still others says it was hot enough. True coffee lovers I believe will not think the coffee is hot enough. I did however make great ice coffee in it. If I had more counter space I'd probably keep it out near my other hot coffee maker and use it for ice coffee."
"November 23, 2019",Jessica L,2.0,,"Bought this last year for a college student, infrequently used while away, used daily since August, coffee now leaks all over the counter after reservoir is full, disappointing that it did not last longer for the price. Replacing it today with a cheaper maker."
"February 2, 2017",TheDonJose,5.0,One,Neat little coffee maker that dispenses nicely. I've wanted a dispensing maker for a while and you can't beat the price on this one. Great traditional setting but the carafe-free set up is the best. Keeps the coffee hot without that burnt taste. Be careful when measuring out your coffee grounds and not to over do it or else you'll have them raise high over the filter and possibly into the water shower portion of the maker.
"March 6, 2014",Amanda,5.0,,"This is my second Hamilton Beach brewstation.  The first one I received as a gift a couple years ago, and like anything else you use every day, it eventually broke.  I moved into a new place, and immediately went to amazon to buy a new one.  It came rather quickly, I ripped open the package, put that puppy right on my kitchen counter, and to my dismay, found it was too tall to fit under my new cabinets :(  Major bummer.  But, I just found a nice cozy spot for it in my pantry when it's not in use.  I would've never thought to measure the space under my cabinets, but make sure you do before you buy this.  It's taller then most coffee pots, I found that out that hard way.  It keeps the coffee wicked hot in the back chamber, and unlike my old Mr. Coffee coffee pot, it NEVER leaks when I'm pouring a cup."
"August 27, 2016",Andi,3.0,One,"We have had brew stations from the start and enjoyed them. This last one is not up to par. The product appeared to be improving with each model This last one that i purchased has been nothing but trouble. The ""clean me"" is always flashing. The ""fill with water"" is always flashing now and it will not push the water that is in the tank through. We have to stand there and keep pushing the on button for it to perk. Today is the last pot I will nurse. It is in the TRASH."
"May 24, 2017",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,"Loved it when I got it, now 4 months later it doesn't work right. I bought it because I could fill the reservoir from my water dispenser.  The reservoir holds 12 cups, it brews about 8-10 cups and leaves water in the bottom of the reservoir. There is only 30 day return on Amazon, but there is a 1 year warranty for Hamilton Beach in which you have to pay shipping both ways.  So if you like half pots of coffee, get this coffeemaker, put it on a full pot and you'll be good. If you like a whole pot, run the other way."
"June 9, 2019",William Marks,2.0,,After less than 2 months of use - The water filler container fell into the kitchen sink while preparing to fill it and the lid broke off.  The hinge is very fragile plastic that is not repairable.  Now the lid will not stay in place and is such a pain that I will have to throw the whole coffee maker in the trash.  I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone.
"November 7, 2019",Sarah K.,2.0,One,"We have had our coffee maker less than 2 months and it just started messing up. It won't process 12 cups of water through, it only pulls 10 cups of water... and quite a bit of that water leaks from out under the container that holds the finished coffee, not understanding from where, how or why.. I LOVE this machine. It is sooo easy to use, but if it breaks down that quick...not sure I want another one. I am going to see if it can be replaced. SAK"
"June 30, 2021",Harold,1.0,,Only used 3 weeks and it was leaking water from the bottom of the tank. Had the same maker prior to this one for 3 years without any issues. This one was just not put together right or something
"January 4, 2018",MelanieR.,5.0,One,"This is our third Brewstation! We love them! They do last, we just had bad luck with ours over the years... first one we had to replace because of rust in our water pipes, second got damaged during a move. But we’ve been using them for years and it is so convenient not having a glass carafe and it keeps the coffee hot for hours while tasting as fresh as the first cup. Don’t think we could ever go back."
"November 7, 2020",Lisa F.,5.0,,"Love it. Can set to keep warm for up to 4 hours! Great feature for me. Does make a sound the whole time it's on, like still brewing even after cycle finishes. Easy to use. Easy to set time and functions. Definitely recommend."
"May 2, 2021",Archibald F MacLeod Sr,1.0,One,It leaked like a sieve!! Some of the screws were not tight on the part where the coffee ends up!
"February 16, 2021",Mandy Oody,5.0,,"I have used this coffee pot for the past 14 years and absolutely LOVE it!  I use it daily and it’s reliable and keeps the coffee warm for hours!  I much prefer this coffee maker I’ve the bun or other expensive brands due to the enclosed compartment.  If you love coffee and enjoy it keeping fresh for hours after it’s made, this is the maker for you!  Also, I am only on my second one in 14 years and that’s because my exhusband kept the other one when we separated!  It is well built and lasts!"
"February 15, 2021",David LHeureux,5.0,,After buying the newer model and being HORRIFIED by how stupid it was. (Who puts the water container UNDER the dispenser and leveling off where the heating element is??) And don't even get me STARTED on the dispenser button that just waterfalled coffee down the front of the machine and ALL OVER the counter... I am thrilled that the old version has been delivering the perfection I was used to!
"April 22, 2020",RyanSandwich,1.0,,"Everything started off well, but after less than a year the coffee maker started leaking.  Coffee would run down onto the heating element, which would burn and give off a nasty smell.  Coffee would also slowly leak down onto the counter.  It's disappointing that so many of the features worked so well, but the simple stuff wasn't made well enough to last for 6 months."
"August 11, 2019",M. Taylor,5.0,,"The box arrived with a fairly deep dent in it but the coffee maker suffered no damage, I was surprised. After unpacking, I immediately rinsed the parts and set it to brew. Try as I might, I really can't find a thing to complain about. For the price I am quite impressed"
"October 21, 2014",joglo,4.0,One,"This coffeemaker is so much better than my old brew station.  They got it right this time with the separate water container but the only minor issue we have with this brew station that when it's done it  makes a continuous noise while it's on.  But yet it's so nice not to have to pour water into it (which usually ended up all over the counter no matter how careful we poured), so we can put up with the noise.  I guess there's nothing perfect but it's funny our old brew station did not continue making noise after it was done brewing but this new one makes noise all the time. If it wasn't for the continuous noise (it's a constant gurgling sound), I would have given this 4 stars."
"February 19, 2021",Tido,2.0,,I had the original brew station  a while back and loved it. I kept seeing bad reviews about this one but I figured I’d give it a shot anyways  since my last experience with one was great. Well let’s just say I should have listened to the reviews. It leaks pretty bad at the dispenser and also when you lift the top the condensation runs down the sides. They should have left it alone because it was just fine before.
"July 17, 2021",bobegnal,2.0,,"The coffee pot makes good coffee, but it really does not last. I wanted a coffee maker without a carafe and this served that purpose. It was purchased in 2019 for a house that we only live in half the year. By 2021 it is dead!"
"January 25, 2018","Artist/Writer &#34;Vernon&#34; from Dallas, Texas",5.0,,"I've had it about a week and so far, so good.  It's a well assembled machine.  I like the ease in loading the coffee and filter and the ease in putting the water in the tank.  Thoughtful design and it makes good coffee.  It does ""sizzle"" all the while the coffee remains in the tank.  But the coffee doesn't taste burnt, so it appears to be normal."
"July 21, 2020",c a b,5.0,,"This is our 3rd unit. We had NO problems with any of them. The only reason we replaced them was cosmetically, scratches and such.  We kept unit clean and never had problems . For the price this is a deal."
"March 19, 2021",Diane Sundberg,3.0,,"If this is 12 cups it’s 12 “small cups”, not near the capacity of our old 12 cup Cuisinart. Also, the dispenser is too far in and does not stick out far enough. It works  and does the job and was a good price. Coffee is good, we always use Uban so it tastes the same as in all coffee makers we have ever had. We prefer this type of coffee maker over the carafe type.  The price was good."
"January 31, 2015",Happy Amazon Guy,1.0,14,"Whoever is designing coffee makers still don't realize that most human beings put their coffee makers on their kitchen counters. And in this magical realm of the kitchen, there are cabinets located directly above the mentioned countertops. So why the crap do they still design coffee makers that have a lid that requires a full range of motion, just to fill the unit with water, that is beyond the measurement of almost every standard countertop-to-wall cabinet setup in the world. My kitchen is not big enough to have a localized area just for my coffee maker. To make matters worse, the Hamilton Beach Brewstation’s maximum overflow hole is located on the back…about a quarter of the way down from the top. This wouldn't be a problem if the unit never had to be moved, but since you have to slide it out just to fill the water reservoir, the trip back to the coffee’s normal brewing spot gets a little wet. And I do mean wet…my kitchen towel looked like it was dropped in a bucket of water. If you will have to move this unit for any reason and want the full 12-cups of coffee, I recommend looking for another coffeemaker. P.S. The Amazon listing also says, “Removable water tank; water-level indicator; dishwasher-safe parts”, but the instructions specifically say to hand wash the inner tank. So basically, the only thing dishwasher safe is the Drip Tray and the Filter Basket. The one thing that has coffee sitting in it for hours upon hours must be hand washed."
"September 9, 2019",Beau F.,1.0,,"I got this to get around my dorms rule about not being able to have hotplates in our rooms. This looked perfect and when i got i was excited to finally have coffee again. However when i plugged it in and hit on it made about 10 drops of coffee and thats it. Tried everything i could to get it to work, had three other people mess with it trying to fix it and no luck. What a waste of time and money. I sent them a support message and i havent heard back from them. I will never buy a Hamilton beach product again."
"April 11, 2014",Stephan J.,5.0,,"After I got use to the idea of no carafe and how to easily clean and use the parts, I was sold. I was surprised at how much the Brewstation improved the taste of the coffee I was brewing. The adjustments for regular, bold and four-cup work well. It was easy to program for auto start. It even has a signal if the maker needs cleaning. It stays on for up to four hours and can be extended by turning the switch off and on again. I love the idea of how simple it is to take just the amount of coffee you want. The scales for filling and how much coffee is left are easy to read. I have found no leak problems and filling the appliance with water should present no problems if you are not careless. It even looks good on the counter. You get a lot for the price."
"February 24, 2021",Kimi Clark,5.0,,"This is my second Hamilton Beach Brewstation Coffeemaker and I love it. The only reason I replaced the first one is after having it for years, it developed a slow leak from the spout so if there was coffee sitting in the pot all day, I would have a small pool of it to clean up. Part of the reason was likely because I didn't clean it as often as I should (I use it every day). Still, it's my very favorite coffee maker and I'm really happy with it."
"November 23, 2015",Glenn CoCo,5.0,One,"I love this coffee maker! I'm an iced coffee addict, but my roommate loves her cup of hot coffee in the morning, so this is perfect. I have it programmed to make my iced coffee in the morning and before I leave for work, I just quickly rinse and prep for my roommate's coffee. It's super easy to clean up and super easy to use and it makes great coffee! This coffee maker has everything you could want in a coffee maker except a bean grinder! Even my mom purchased one after I got mine. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
"March 11, 2019",Pipeweld,1.0,,"This is a terrible coffee machine!!! Do not buy!!! Leaks water all over the place. Everytime we try to make coffee with this thing, we have to dry up the counter top. Water runs out of the bottom when you fill the reservoir.  Terrible design.  Read the other reviews.  We had a similar model for 10 years no problem. But this new design with a separate water tank is not good!"
"April 6, 2020",Larry and Patricia,1.0,,"It’s great for like 6 months. I’ve bought 2 of these since April 2019 because they break within a few months. I take care of my machines too. The coffee is great, easy to use but short lifespan."
"February 2, 2021",C.K.,1.0,,"This is the second time we purchased this coffee machine, thinking the first was defective. With both coffee makers, over time, the entire pot of coffee will leak from the machine on to your counter. This doesn't happen randomly - it happens after EACH use. Although the product has a limited one year warranty, the company requires you to pay to ship your defective item to replace it with a new, defective item. Very disappointing that they do not stand behind the quality of their product and offer a refund."
"January 29, 2020",Kathy Simon,5.0,,"Love our new coffeemaker. My favorite feature is no glass kraft to keep clean. You set it for how long you want it to keep warm. I use 2 hours. At the end of that time it is piping hot.  A great coffeemaker, especially for the price."
"March 19, 2013",M,5.0,,"My in-laws have had a Hamilton Beach model for many years. After their most recent one had begun to wear out and leak around the inside, I decided to find them a new model as close to the one that they were using. Unfortunately, that model was no longer in production but I did find this one. After reading reviews, I did find some negative ones about coffee spilling out all over the station and counter. Despite the reviews, I ordered the product and it came in about two days. Once we had cleaned and brewed coffee for the first time, we used different sized mugs and none of them caused a leak. Most of the leaks appear to be from people using a thermos as shown in the product stock image. The vast majority of thermos' will be able to be filled from the station without an issue. I can see some that are larger than 1 L leaking but as long as the thermos is not too wide at the top, you should be able to fill it without any issue. If you use this station to drink from a mug in the morning and maybe fill up a thermos for work, you will be fine. If you have a larger thermos and will only use a coffee maker to pour coffee into your thermos, you are better off getting a carafe or a machine with a coffee pot. Despite the stock photo for the product, you would be better off using this station to fill a mug rather than solely using it for a thermos."
"April 10, 2018",Babs,5.0,,"I bought one of these coffee makers used about four years ago. These machines are the best! No pot to worry about, brews 2-12 cups of coffee. Just put your cup on the grate, press the bar and in about 30 seconds you have a full cup of coffee. This machine also fills travel mugs and makes great iced coffee. I'll never go back to a maker with pot again!"
"February 15, 2021",Mariam,3.0,,"This is the second Hamilton Beach I have purchased. Will not buy another one. After about a month of use they both started leaking. Makes a big stain on countertop. Love the one cup at a time brewer, but not worth the mess."
"October 8, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"The coffee maker arrived on August 31st.  It's a nice looking unit and easy to understand the setup and use.  However, within 2 weeks it struggled to pump the water from the water receptacle to the brew section. I've tried all sorts of things to get it to send the water through the system, but nothing seems to work.  It could just be this particular unit.  I was excited because I didn't have to deal with an actual pot, but now it's back to something with a pot because I don't trust the dispensing machine."
"November 9, 2020",Angela H.,5.0,,"Great coffe potwith full flavor. Comes apart to fill the water easily as pictured. The whole thing is amazing and very easy to clean. The clock light is nice and bright(I use it for a night light now). Highly recommended,  I  am very happy especially for the price."
"February 27, 2021",J. DellaPorte,2.0,,"I have to say, i just don't like it. The ""keep warm feature"" isn't very effective at all.  It leaks underneath the unit and destroys the counter top unless you catch it right away. I thought I'd like the lack of carafe, but the convenience isn't worth it."
"May 24, 2020",Julie Nunn,1.0,,The first one I bought began leaking after only two months of use.  It was used properly just as the directions specified.  I thought it was just s defect in manufacturing so I requested a replacement which was given to me at no charge.  The second one did the EXACT same thing after only ONE month of use.  I do not recommend this coffee maker.  Very poor construction.  I believe it must have a defect in the seal.  I went back to a Mr. Coffee and am completely satisfied at a fraction of the cost.
"December 4, 2017",PattyLC3,4.0,,"I had one like this for many years and was so disappointed when it gave up the ghost that I ordered another one. I love not having to lift out the pot to get a cup (or a half a cup) of coffee. I also like being able to set how long it will keep it warm - up to 4 hours! It is easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's not quite clear where the 12 cup line is, and if you overfill it, it slops out on the counter. Just make sure the water stops at the bottom of the ""arrow"" showing 12 cups."
"January 1, 2021",Vicki J. Reichlein,1.0,,"This product came to us three days ago and we have not had a single success with it.  It constantly alerts us that it needs to be cleaned, blinks on and off as it's brewing, or not brewing, as the case may be.  It isn't satisfied with three thorough cleanings following the directions exactly.  We get one super terrible bitter cup and if it even completes brewing, the rest are like tea.  Horrible, can't return it fast enough."
"April 5, 2014",T. Little,5.0,,"This is my second brewstation. My old on lasted 9 years, I have never had a coffee maker last that long. I was very worried at first when I read the bad reviews about the newer models but I read a few great reviews and decided to go ahead a get a new one. I am glad I did. This new model is so much better than the old one that I loved. It is easier to pour water into and it is taller than the old one, my husband can easily fill his very large mugs in it. The temperature is nice and hot and it stays that way for up to 4 hours. I learned with my old brewstation that if it started dripping coffee, it was because coffee grounds had gotten stuck in the dispenser. Be very careful when you put the coffee in the filter and don't get any on the basket itself or they will fall into the pot and get stuck in the dispenser. If it does happen, it is very easy to clean out."
"May 30, 2021",Pete C.,1.0,,Worked great the first year. The second year it had problems with the dispenser.  I woke up to this mess today. Customer service would only offer free delivery on a new purchase. Whoopdee doo!  Coffee machines should last many years! Don’t buy this junk!
"April 9, 2014",Cake,3.0,,"My first-generation Hamilton Brew Station was AMAZING!!  I used it daily for 5 years and it started to fail, so I knew I wanted another one.  Now there are several more models, which I've discovered is not always a good thing.  I read many reviews of each model and decided to buy this one, even though the reviews pointed out some negatives.  Two issues I read in the reviews are actually true... the coffee pot continues to make the ""gurgling/hissing"" brewing noise the entire time it's warming (2-4 hours).  This would be totally annoying if I consumed my morning joe right in the kitchen.  Since I do not, it's not that big of a deal to me.  Also, some reviews said the coffee did not get hot enough... this is true if you like your coffee SUPER hot, which I don't... but it would be nice if it were a little hotter for me.  My original Brew Station brewed hotter coffee than this one.  This model also allows you to keep the coffee warm for longer periods... up to 4 hours.  When I used the 3-hour option, I noticed my coffee did taste a little burnt, but I need to try it a few more times to make sure.  All in all, for the price I paid for it, it's really adequate for what I need."
"November 23, 2018",James Rogers,3.0,,I like the functionally of the machine. The water reservoir and coffee reservoir idea is great. I like that you can dismantle it to make it easy to clean. The only problem I have with the coffee maker is that the coffee doesn't stay hot after the itinial cup. If you like your coffee hot this coffee maker is not the one for you. I would have given 5 stars if it keep the coffee hot.
"January 10, 2017",Kelly Hughes,5.0,One,"We had an older version of this coffee maker (same brand name) and I was worried that I wouldn't find another like it. Not only do they still manufacture this brewing station, it has greatly improved! This makes coffee faster, has an automatic setting, and I can fit a travel mug under it! (The older version was only big enough for a regular mug.) This was an excellent choice for my love affair with coffee! ❤️☕️"
"November 29, 2016",Mom of 2,4.0,,I use this in my Camper (no glass to break while in transport).  It is very easy to use and I love how there is no glass coffee pot.  Just fill your mug and enjoy.  It keeps the coffee really hot which is nice.  The only issue I have is the quality of it seems slightly flimsy.  I'm not sure how long it would hold up to every day use but since I only use it a few weekends here and there while out camping it's perfect.  And for the money I think it's a very good deal!
"April 17, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"We've now owned this coffee maker for about 2 years. The pot keeps coffee warm and fresh-tasting for several hours.  A couple quick tips - if you're making 4 cups, there's a special setting for that! Also to clean, I use a coffee machine cleaner or just run hot water through so the cover is flushed of grounds. The only drawbacks: it drips when pulling the coffee cup away from the dispenser and although the top is removable, it doesn't go back on easily and feels like it would break."
"February 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I ordered this coffee maker to replace my Hamilton Beach coffee maker that had finally fizzled out after several years. I have been disappointed with this model. The biggest complaint is the mess it makes. The dispenser drips every time I fill my cup and even though there is a drip tray to catch drips, coffee ends up underneath the whole coffee maker.  Also, it does not seem to keep as hot as my previous coffee maker.  I am disappointed with it and intend on replacing it in the near future."
"February 26, 2017",J. MCBRIDE,5.0,,"When my old Mr Coffee burned out I looked for something new and different, and I found this HB Brewstation.  It's easy too use and makes terrific coffee.  The feature I like most is how you press your cup against the dispensing button and coffee pours directly into your cup, no fussing with a carafe, and no coffee dripping on a burner when you remove the carafe.  Glad I bought it."
"May 15, 2019",Loco,4.0,,"We loved this design so much, we bought a second one.  Ours started leaking where you press your cup to fill it (it works like a soda fountain).  But sometimes it wouldn't stop the flow immediately and coffee would dribble out causing a bit of a mess.  We thought our first one was broken, but it turns out this is a common thing it does.  It's not enough for us to not buy and enjoy it, but just know you'll need to keep an eye on that drip pan - it fills up quick."
"January 28, 2018",Kcwin,3.0,One,"The design, size and features are great. However, the depth of where you put your coffee cup in is not deep enough to center the output of the coffee. The hot water/ coffee hit my hand.  When you push the cup on the lever to get your coffee the whole unit slides back.  So I pushed the unit to the back of the counter and it was fine.  We just typically have ours out a bit. A better design would be - a slightly deeper indentation to put your cup and the level just below the buttons so you can manually release the coffee/water.  Overall we kept it and will get used to the swallow part of dispensing. Overall design and features are nice though."
"January 15, 2017",roseosharone,5.0,,"We bought the predecessor of this unit 12 years ago. It moved with us 3 times and even help us cater a wedding. It was a great unit used daily and lasted us a good long while. We have great hopes for this unit and thus far are delighted with the improved design, the added features while still maintaining the shape and convenience we enjoyed with our previous unit. For people like us who frequently entertain, this product is a must have."
"January 4, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,"This machine is the best. The. Best. Relatively little maintenance required (just rinsing and the occasional soaping for the pot), and the programmable brew time is killer for cold mornings when I just need the aroma of magical bean juice to tempt me out of a warm bed. Gladly left the Keurig behind  (or really, am using it to heat water for tea and hot chocolate until it dies), and will never look back."
"December 8, 2017",P E,4.0,,"This is quite similar to the previous model we had for many years.  It seems to work just fine as did the last one, however, it is constantly making noise when it is on and finished brewing. Not gurgling like a brewing phase but an electrical humming type of sound.  Our previous one did not do this and I am suspicious that it may indicate a short lifespan for this coffee maker."
"December 4, 2019",NB,4.0,,Had it for about 2 weeks. The program timer works. It works great so far. It was a replacement for a thermal carafe coffeemaker (every once in awhile the coffee would spill out instead of going into the carafe). Shouldn't have this problem since it stays in a reservoir until ready to drink. Also bought the filters from Dollar Tree.
"May 29, 2020",Stephanie Brothers,5.0,,"I ordered this for my parents who desperately needed a new coffee maker. They were a little unsure at first because they are used to the standard machine with a carafe. They've had it for about 2 weeks now and they are loving it! They say it's easy to set up, holds plenty of coffee and keeps it hot, and it's easy to clean."
"March 22, 2021",BG,3.0,,Not really easy to pour water into the brewer without spilling.  Once coffee is brewed it is impossible to get a cup of coffee out of it without leaking.  Leaks from the outlet where the coffee should normally go into your cup.  Finally figured out I need at least 3 paper towels under the machine and collection tray to keep coffee off the counter and floor.
"November 16, 2014",Jimster66,4.0,,"There's a lot I like about this coffeemaker.  It keeps the coffee hot and the coffee is stored in a closed dispenser so air doesn't get at it.  The tank easily detaches so it can be filled and then placed back on the side of the coffeemaker without any pouring which can create spills.  There is no glass carafe to break, everything is plastic.  There is an easy to set timer which has the coffee ready for us when we get up in the morning and there are some custom settings you can use for coffee strength and the length of time the dispenser stays hot.  Have you ever got up and found that for some reason your coffeemaker overflowed all over your counter?  With this Hamilton Beach model that's practically impossible because any overflow from the filter basket goes into the dispenser.  That  eliminates a major headache.  The only point that I don't like and that keeps me from giving a five star rating is condensation that collects on the lid on the dispenser and usually gets down the side of the dispenser onto the bottom of the appliance.  The condensation is from keeping the coffee hot, which I like, but I use a paper towel to dry the inside every day after the dispenser is empty"
"May 4, 2021",Brittany,3.0,One,"Love the design of the coffee pot with internal storage.. I happen to buy a used one off Amazon wearhouse and I love it minus the fact it does have a little leak... Not quite sure why, but it does leak on the bottom. To much of a hassle to return ANOTHER coffee pot, so I'm just keeping it... Would recommend buying BRAND NEW 😁"
"May 16, 2021",Vanmarbu,4.0,,Love this coffee maker! It leaks form the dispenser though and its really irritating. Had to stuff a folded paper towel in the drip area to absorb the leaks because the little tray does not catch it completely.
"March 24, 2019",Kirsten Q.,5.0,,"WE LOVE OUR COFFEE STATION ♥️ This is the second brew station we bought and it is even better than the first!!! This newer model is easier to fill as the reservoir detaches and can be brought to the sink, then reattached to the side. The only reason this is our second is because we recently moved and wanted a brand new brew station in our new home.  The price is very reasonable, so....why not! And, one less thing to move."
"February 22, 2020",Jane B.,5.0,,We'd had the 48464 and it was always rather slow dispensing despite keeping clean.  We'd had the 47900 version years ago and decided to go back to that model.  No dispense issues and much easier to fill the tank and keep each component clean.  Very pleased with the 47900.
"July 16, 2020",Al Jones,1.0,,Brand new and every time you get a cup of coffee the push tab that allows the coffee to pour into your cup snaps out of alignment and then you have to use a kitchen utensil to get it to pop back to where it goes. Hamilton Beach needs to provide a part to fix this problem.
"February 3, 2019",Julia,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot. The removable tank is so easy to clean, and it's nice not having a coffee carafe- everything is contained. It makes quite a bit of noise while brewing (just bubbling sounds) but it brews coffee really quickly so it's not an issue for me. It has an easy programmable feature and can keep coffee hot for up to 4 hours. The construction seems a little flimsy, so I'm not sure how long it will last.. but I've had it a month now and really love it. Would definitely recommend this!"
"April 6, 2021",Connie Lambert,3.0,,"Have used this coffee maker for several years and every unit I have purchased has leaked! The leaks either come from the dispensing spout or from the reservoir.  Sometimes leaks onto the counter.  The best thing about this model is that there is NO carafe to break! However, since we have gone through three units, you would think the manufacturer would have fixed this issue over the years.  It does make good coffee and is easy to program."
"January 2, 2017",Paul D.,4.0,,"Only 4 stars because it is not as good as the version it replaces-- which was faultless and better.  This is good too- just not as well designed.  It makes me wonder if someone, somewhere, out there, in the coffee engineering clouds said ""hey you, see this perfect coffee maker? I want you to design something not as good so we can sell it for the same price and call it new.""  This is a popular coffee maker because of its ability to pour morning brew by simply pressing your mug against it- and this- it does perfectly... its the rest that is a down grade."
"February 16, 2020",Jeanie,3.0,,"The reviews were good, but I’m not a fan of the coffee it makes. Tried different blends, grinds, etc. coffee just isn’t very good. It doesn’t seem to get hot enough long enough to make a good cup of coffee. Easy to use, but would not recommend."
"August 6, 2012",RandyIL,4.0,One,"I had the older model Brewstation that we used every day at work.  It finally started to die after 7-years of service.  I was nervous about the reviews here but this new model is an improvement over the old. - Keeps coffee hot for up to 4-hours without as much burning flavor as other coffee pots.  Like many things, coffee is better fresh than on the warmer, but it has less burning flavor than glass pots on a hot-plate. - BOLD brews a stronger coffee, we save on coffee beans - Many of us have the tall Contigo cups. This is a little short for those, we removed the drip pan and it's fine then. It is a great $50 coffee maker and I have no qualms about making even my fresh-ground Yirgacheffe coffee in this maker. -1 star for the tall cups still not fitting and the water take being slightly more difficult to fill."
"October 30, 2012",R. Shaw,3.0,,"I really like the brewstation concept and this unit is a great bargain for less than $50. It makes fine coffee and keeps it relatively fresh inside its tank. However, I have been frustrated by a few aspects. My biggest complaint is the mess made from brewing and the difficutly with cleaning. The water distribution is apparently too quick, causing the basket holding the grounds to quickly overflow if you make more than four cups. The overflow occurs whether grinding my own beans or pre-ground coffee. It does not overflow outside the unit, but it makes a big mess inside, particularly on the water distribution head. I have to take the whole unit to the sink and rinse it out for every pot. Usually, some residual grounds get stuck down inside the tank. After a few months, the coffeemaker is somewhat fouled with old grounds. The issues that other users have (spout placement, splashing, condensation,  are mostly manageable, but the cleanup for this machine is becoming too much of a nuisance. I have purchased the Krupps machine that uses the Brewstation (no carafe) concept and so far it seems to be a better, albet more expensive, option."
"October 9, 2012",Ms. Bea Haven,5.0,,"We have had a Bunn coffee maker for the past 15 years. My husband loves how quickly those make coffee, while I didn't like them because the water doesn't spend enough time in contact with the grounds to brew a decent cup. That problem has been solved ever since we bought this coffee maker on the recommendation of a friend. Not only does my husband love the programmable part, he even recognizes how much better the coffee tastes. And, since I get up a full two hours later than he does, I absolutely ADORE that my first cup tastes just as fresh as his since it's not sitting on a burner. Heck, I've even gone as late as 5 hours later to the machine (though the ""keep warm"" option only lasts 4 hours) and still found a perfectly acceptable cup of coffee. Love this thing."
"July 5, 2020",Sarah H,1.0,,I ordered this coffee maker on April 28th and on July 4th it was leaking from the heat seal on the bottom and made a huge mess! For the coffee to be warm enough to drink I still had to wait after it was done brewing several minutes for the heat source to warm it up enough to get my first cup. I also felt the plastic that dispenses looked cheap. I had to hold the coffee maker in place to press for a cup to dispense. Not a good purchase!
"January 6, 2018",NC Born & Raised,5.0,,"This is the absolute best coffee maker I’ve ever owned. I’ve bought one for me and just gave one as a gift. The coffee stays so warm and fresh. It’s just as tasty 4 hours after brewing as it is right after brewing. It’s easy to use and takes less room on the counter because there’s no coffee pot. It is a little taller however. I’ve had mine for over a year, use it every day, and it’s going strong. This is the only coffee maker I’ll ever buy."
"August 22, 2019",NaturalHolly,5.0,,"We're really enjoying this coffee maker.  It's so convenient to have coffee ready when we wake up.  It's pretty quick and makes good coffee.  The coffee stays hot, without burning, for several hours.  It easily comes apart for thorough cleaning to remove any build up."
"August 19, 2014",Spencer,5.0,2,"This Brew Station makes very good regular coffee.  Haven't tried it for bold or iced coffee, and haven't tried the 2-4 cup setting.  It's convenient to use and clean.  A fine filter at the dispensing point prevents any grounds from getting into your cup, even if some get into the holding tank.  The timer for how long to keep brewed coffee warm has a 0 hour setting, so the unit will turn off once coffee is brewed.  This prevents the coffee from continuing to cook.  A quick zap in a microwave will heat your cup, and the coffee will taste fresh even hours after brewing."
"December 8, 2017",Renae Quinn,3.0,,"We've had this coffee maker about a year. It worked wonderfully for awhile (solving the problem of keeping coffee hot for awhile without having that ""cooked"" flavor from sitting on a burner plate). But now the dispenser screen on the inside is not functioning properly. Cleaning it with a scrub brush is difficult and only solved the problem for one brew cycle. Now the coffee just barely dribbles out. I find this coffee maker difficult to clean. And if you like strong coffee, by adding more coffee grounds, this coffee maker doesn't handle it well. Overall: difficult to clean and screen clogs preventing dispenser from working properly."
"February 3, 2021",Unsatisfied,1.0,,"I was really excited when I got this coffee maker I thought it would be great it’s a wonderful idea. However, it does leak down the front of the machine when you try to dispense your coffee. About 1/4 of the coffee you pour goes down the front of the machine. I had to put a paper towel to catch the coffee that missed my cup. I contacted customer service and they are sending me a return label and a refund. They also offered a free replacement but I refused it. Good luck with this one."
"July 19, 2018",Gumbysgal,4.0,One,"Item is as described--economical drip coffeemaker with built in carafe.  I LOVE that I can set it the night before, and set how long to keep it warm.  It keeps my coffee fairly warm for up to an hour after it shuts off.  I like that I can take it apart to rinse it out.  I DON'T like that the feet on the bottom come off easily every time I scoot it on the counter (mine is under a cabinet and has to come forward to pour in water).  Would recommend so far--I'll update when I've had it awhile"
"November 17, 2017",Dorothy Ebacher,4.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  I like the idea of no carafe. The only thing I don't really like is the button that you press your cup up to, it's a bit slippery, it should have a rubbery surface to prevent my cup from sliding off of it. Also it should have a small light that shines down into the coffee cup for people like me who get up early in the morning before light, but don't want to turn lights on yet. It's hard to see when my cup is full, the display light is so bright, I have to cover it with my hand."
"July 20, 2018",Diann M. Jones,5.0,One,"Love the Brewster. Had one for years, finally cracked, so wanted the same. This is easier with the side fill. It is lighter, so need to be against wall when getting coffee, or it will slide. I do the bold setting and get nice rich coffee."
"December 9, 2019",Dastin67,2.0,One,I really liked the design of this coffee maker. My only complaint is that it is noisy. When the coffee is done brewing it continues to make a humming noise for the entire time the warming feature is on. very very annoying!!
"January 6, 2017",Ramos Washington,5.0,,"Our old Brewstation finally gave way after 15 years.  We are very pleased with the new model.  It's much easier to fill and brews faster due to the extra holes in the filter basket.  It seems better insulated, so we turned off the keep-warm heater to avoid a scorched taste.  It now has a mesh screen around the dispensing valve, which should prevent coffee grounds from sticking the valve open.  The only minor complaint is the very bright blue illuminated display.  We don't brew coffee in the dark, and our kitchen doesn't need a night light."
"December 7, 2017",Shopper,3.0,,"We bought this about 6 months ago, daily use. Pros: good price, no glass carafe, fast, hot coffee, no burnt coffee taste. Cons: serving size not true to standard coffee cups, hard to empty water in holding reservior, after 6 months of purchase, began to slow down brewing time and began to leak, where the gasket is. Tried to repair, clean, but still leaked. Have to have cup on the tray to catch the leaks. Will not buy again."
"March 13, 2021",Terri Griffin,5.0,,"I looked at hundreds of options to replace my 1 year old Kitchenaid coffee maker before deciding on this. It’s easy to use, clean, fill and I love the design. I use a reusable filter which is a approx. 6.00 investment but overall worth it. I’m completely happy I chose the Brewstation."
"October 17, 2018",cat walker 3,5.0,,"This is my 2nd one!! Although my 1st one didn't really die, it just got slow. It lasted over 2 yrs.  This pot is very durable, easy to clean, looks great & you have hot coffee almost all the time. I set mine to stay hot for 4 hrs & it stays hot for at least another hr.  I make coffee at least twice a day & it really is good, never tastes stale or burnt & I will order one again when this one gives out."
"April 5, 2019",atay04,3.0,,"I really like the depression of a button and the coffee is dispensed.  My only complaint is that when emptying the pot when trying to make another, it is REALLY hot.  You have to be careful not to burn yourself as I have a few times.  Probably wouldn't purchase again for this reason."
"January 10, 2020",BC hou,1.0,,"Had a similar designed coffee maker for about a decade and found this one after it finally gave out. So I was really excited to have a similar replacement. I had this about one month before it started leaking coffee all over the counter. There is no pump moving coffee through the machine to your cup, the coffee is instead brewed into the top portion and the lever to get coffee appears to just pour it in the cup. Even after numerous attempts to clean it the unit is still leaking. So I guess it only lasts one month. It was a good month though."
"October 16, 2017",Maggie,5.0,,"Bought this for my other half and I after our keurig broke.  In the end we like the ability to choose how much coffee we want to make, plus a lot less waste then a keurig.  The other half loves that it can make iced coffee.  This is a very easy to use device that has many great features.  Very easy to clean and keep up with.  Have had zero issues and it runs like a charm!"
"September 14, 2019",S R. Sims,5.0,,"This is the 4th BrewStation I have owned. The machine is straight-forward in design/use. I enjoy having no breakable coffee pot  Auto on feature is great, and you can determine how long to keep it on. I have a companion K-cup machine on my coffee bar, but this BrewMaster gets used much more often. I recommend it highly."
"August 30, 2018",Robyn Maggard,2.0,One,My coffee pot leaks. I fill before bed and leaks water out before morning. Loved before started leaking about 3 weeks after getting. Unhappy.
"February 20, 2013",Carrie,4.0,2,"I needed a coffee maker that wouldn't scorch the coffee when it was turned on for several hours.  I was also sick of dealing with carafes.  I looked at many different brands and models and am very pleased I decided on this one. Brew time is fairly average, nothing to write home about.  It makes a nice HOT cup o' Joe and the brew strength selection is great.  I prefer my coffee strong. The other reason I selected this was that other brands didn't have enough clearance for the larger travel cups. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is that it's slightly bulky and cumbersome to fill with water.  Other than that it has a nice size footprint and all the bells & whistles this coffee lover was looking for.  Very pleased."
"May 15, 2020",Lulu,3.0,,"I dont like how you have to take the 2 top pieces out to fill the water reservoir,  and it has an overflow hole in the back that flows all over the counter if you mive the machine when irs filled with water. It is a sturdy machine and makes good coffee but i will purchase a different type in the future."
"February 22, 2014",William J.,4.0,One,"It is a very good coffeemaker.  One problem that I noticed from other posts before we purchased this item was it didn't keep the coffee hot enough.  I encountered this problem when I first started using it -but- have corrected it.  It has always been my habit of cleaning the filter/grounds out of coffeemaker when finished brewing which I did with this item.  After thinking about it for a few days I noticed that when you take the filter/grounds out you leave a ""big"" gap just above the reservoir that holds the coffee which leaves cooler air in around your coffee and the heat from the coffee to escape.  Now I leave everything in place til later in  the day when I set it up for the next day and the coffee does stay hot.  I hope this helps other people.  Over all we like it and are thinking about ordering 2 more 1 for each of our daughters.  The hard part was breaking the habit of reaching for the ""carafe"" to get your coffee-after years of reaching it is a habit that's hard to overcome. No problems with it so far - have had it for 5 weeks and use it everyday."
"January 31, 2016",MommaDeeMarie,1.0,One,"This coffee pot is a great idea ! However, the application of the idea is where it falls short. I used this every day for about a month with no problems. Now Any time I make coffee it drips, not a huge problem, but it makes a huge mess. It just doesn't look clean sitting on counter with a cup that always has coffee in it. Even after I thought I had all of the coffee out, there is more dripping out. I would not recommend spending the money of this coffee pot. It is a neat idea that just doesn't work."
"April 13, 2013",Laurafhl,5.0,,"Took me a bit to figure it out only because I didn't read the instructions.. duh.. Keeps the coffee hot, doesn't make a mess like can sometimes happen when pouring a karaf. Only down side is when the coffee gets low, the weight gets light and the coffee maker wants to scoot a bit when pushing the cup against the pourer.. Easy fix to just lay your hand against the back of the maker when getting the coffee. Oh and the other down side. I can't figure out how to extend the heater time for the coffee past 4 hours. Usually you just push the start button to extend the time.. It wants me to add water and has a safety setting that will turn it off till you add water. There is probably a way but I need to look it up."
"October 10, 2015",sharris1134,4.0,,"We love the coffee maker. We bought it through the Amazon warehouse deals. It had been returned from a customer, then inspected and put up for sale at a great discount price. We received the unit in good shape and it makes great tasting coffee. The only issue is that it make a gurgling sound the whole time it is on (after the coffee makes. I suspect that is why it was returned). We decided to keep it in spite of the noise because it was a really great price. Overall it is a great coffee maker and I would not hesitate recommending to a friend."
"December 30, 2020",Linda Tarka,1.0,,This coffee maker leaks like a sieve. We purchased this one because we had one like it for 14 years. So we thought getting another one would be a great idea. From day one leaks near the spout. We tried all the suggestions which some were a little ridiculous ( the vinegar to clean a brand new coffee maker). Anyhow I would not recommend getting unless you want coffee all over your counter. Other site ( Target) have multiple bad reviews. I wouldn't have given it a one  rating but no other choice
"January 22, 2019",Just the facts,4.0,,"I have bought this item twice. The first one lasted 1.5 years. I got it for my parents (I do not drink coffee). They like it and when their  coffee maker started to leak after a year and a half, I bought them the same model again."
"February 8, 2020",Tyler,1.0,One,"We had an older model of this same coffee maker for over 5 years and never experienced any problems.  This one leaks as you dispense coffee.  It leaks above the dispense bar and runs down the outside of the cup and the front of the maker.  Constant clean up with each dispense.  Contacted company and they sent a replacement part, but problem still existed.  Not pleased with the money spent on this item."
"January 11, 2015",Holly C.,3.0,4,"This is my husbands favorite coffee maker.  That being said we have ordered four.  I love the options that this coffee maker has *(4 hour warming option, hot or iced coffee, bold or regular strength etc.)  The only issues that I have with this product are as follows: Plastic on the lid is flimsy and can break easily.  The removable resivoir is not flush to the machine, Two of the four that we ordered had a mysterious leak that we could not locate so there were times when we brewed coffee and more of it was on the counter rather than in resivoir,"
"April 26, 2020",lori,2.0,,I really love the coffee storage so you dont have yo deal with as burnt pot... but ive found this model leaks alot and fills up with condensation under storage container. Dumping old coffee is easy using is easy. Only had it a month and not very hsppy unfortunatly. Wish i loved it.
"May 22, 2019",LS,5.0,,"I seriously LOVE this coffee maker!  It's a little bit of a change from a traditional drip machine, but so worth it!  Makes great coffee  (I love the bold option) and it stays fresh and hot for up to 4 hours.  Taste is the same freshly brewed as it is 3 hours later.  I can now make one pot for me, ready at 7 a.m. and it's still fresh for my husband at 8:30.  Brilliant technology!"
"April 1, 2019",Germanator,5.0,,Easy to use and clean. Love the way it's made and the way it works. Keeps coffee hot for up to 4 hours. Internal pot. Detatchable water tank for easy filling. Programable. Useful and no complaints. Thinking about leaving the wife for this coffee pot. Way more useful!
"December 15, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I had, what I suppose you would call, the great granddaddy HamiltonBeach version of this coffee maker for the past 16 years.  It was the perfect coffee maker.  In the past few months, it would leak a bit for some unknown reason after it brewed but only occasionally.  I wouldn't  give up on that unit but my husband convinced me to get a new one.  I found this one on Amazon & ordered it.  Wow,  I am So pleased I did.  It is a sleek looking unit, brews perfect coffee to your taste (regular, bold or cold), and has the option of maintaining hot coffee up to 4 hours.  This is a Great unit and reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend it if you like a tasty cup of brewed coffee."
"March 5, 2020",Steven B.,5.0,,"We make coffee everyday, so we are hard on our coffee makers. This is our 3rd one of these in 8 years. I wish they lasted longer but the spring that opens the spout tends to wear out. The coffee doesn't get so burnt by leaving it in the maker as the carafe styles we used to use."
"September 19, 2014",Chuck,5.0,,"We typically use Maxwell House and it now tastes so much better than it did with the drip model.  It used to have a bitter edge and just assumed it wasn't Starbucks so that was that.  With this unit, no bitterness from plain old Maxwell House.  Coffee is the same temp just after brewing as it is 4 hours later. Two things for the wish list but they don't take away from the unit.  I'm probably the only one who hears this because it is 5am and no one else is up, but after it is done brewing it makes a little noise.  The push bar to fill the cub could be a little longer by a half inch to an inch. Other than those two things, great coffee maker."
"July 15, 2020",Paul J. Jacobsen,5.0,,I've had one of these for the past 10 or 12 years. Love the brewing timer. Keep warm timer. Easy to fill and clean. I've given as gifts and recommend to many family and friends.
"November 17, 2019",DJB,1.0,,"I enjoyed one of these units for years and had no issues.  When the plastic component that allows the tank to open and fill a cup cracked and failed after years of use, I wanted to get an identical replacement.  But it seems the plastic manufacturing quality has become poor.  The first replacement had a defect/hole in the base where the tank inserted, which would allow condensation water to drain into the inside of the base.  A second replacement had the tank not fitting snug into the base due to being warped."
"June 26, 2020",Mikayla Lubbock,5.0,,"My aunt has had this coffee pot for years, so when I bought my house I knew I needed one too! Super easy to fill, I just his start, then timed brew before bed and heard it brewing this morning as I was snoozing my alarm. Made it so much easier to get up to the fresh smell of coffee!!"
"July 20, 2019",April H,1.0,,"It boils your coffee....no matter how much is in it, you can hear it boiling at the hot plate.  My older maker like this worked great for 15 years. This newer model is awful. I’m thinking of throwing it out in exchange for a glass craft basic model."
"September 18, 2014",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"My wife and I divide the chores (she makes the coffee, I do the grocery shopping).  She got tired to cleaning the traditional coffee makers with their carafes, and wanted a K-cup coffee maker.  I didn't like the cost of single serving coffee.  Then we found the HB Brewstation.  I answered her needs and my desire to keep per serving cost down.  It's easy to use, very compact, and simple to clean.  It uses the flat-bottomed filters as opposed to the cone shape.  We've used both and really don't see a difference in the end product.  Finally, this makes and keeps coffee very hot."
"October 31, 2018",Cortney Griffith,3.0,,This is the second time i have purchased this coffee maker as i do not like a pot and i do not like the expense of having a kureg. However if you do not keep the screen onnthe inside super clean then it will start to leak and drip all over your counter. I do not know how to remedy this problem as i rince it everytime it is emptied.
"April 1, 2018",MBF,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker! I had this model when it originally came out many moons ago and forgot how super convenient and easy it is to use. No more broken carafes! Well worth the few extra dollars, definitely more efficient keeping coffee warm than a glass pot. The bucket, well and basket are super easy and quick to clean. Great clearance for your tall coffee mugs, save my 32 oz Yeti tumbler but o be fair that thing is massive. Still, I can maneuver it underneath to get a mostly full cup. All-in-all a highly recommended buy!"
"December 8, 2020",auntdonna,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  Being disabled, it is so easy now to make coffee.  I also like that you have a choice of length of time to keep coffee hot.  This gives you 4 hours."
"June 7, 2020",Woody54,1.0,,"We loved this coffee maker until it started leaking all over the counter in a few months. Does not always use all the cold water, so it fails to make a full pot. Trashed it in less than 9 months."
"December 13, 2015",Rebecca Beckensten,2.0,,"I have has this coffee pot for a year. I didn't review it until now (the day I came back to buy a different one). I love the design. Love that it doesn't have the traditional pot. It's easy to clean, easy to program, easy to use. The bad: Occasionally it leaks water EVERYWHERE when you put the full water reservoir on. At first I thought I didn't get it on all the way, but after the 2nd time, I was very careful every time and still have had it happen countless times. The lid to the water reservoir is very flimsy and broke after a week (my fault for accidentally hitting it when I took it out, but I wouldn't have expected a light accident to break it off)."
"March 20, 2020",William Catto,1.0,,I have used this model for approximately 20 years. They were great during that time. I have tried to replace it with the current model and three in a row have leaked while dispensing the coffee. The coffee leaves the carafe and migrates back to the lever and then down the back of the dispensing area. It's extremely frustrating that it wasn't just a one-off but that the three coffeemakers shipped to me by Amazon within the last month all have the same defect. Great design that used to work. The quality assurance must be horrible.
"April 27, 2019",Denise Averis,1.0,,This coffee machine is horrible every night we kept on trying to make sure the water well was set into the unit  And every morning we were cleaning water up off the floor because it leaked right out.  We wasted water and coffee.
"September 12, 2014",Inahka,4.0,,"I love the design of this coffee maker; it is very easy to use and clean. I like that I can use the coffee tank to measure the water and pour into the reservoir. I haven't had any difficulties with the dispenser; it is a little close to the back of the machine but it works fine with my mugs. The only con I have really encountered is the temperature of the coffee, sometimes my first mug is okay, but often it is not hot enough for me and I have to microwave it for a bit. (Mind you, I like my coffee hot!) I tried programming it ahead of time so that it could sit in the warmer longer, but that didn't seem to make a difference. The last mug is always super hot, though. But even with that it is the best coffee maker I have bought."
"January 9, 2021",Mary,1.0,,"I bought this pot even though I saw reviews that the drips leak  I had an older model and it leaked from the drip pan just a little but was because it overfilled with drips  I saw that this newer model had a bigger drip catcher, so assumed would be OK  NOT SO!!!  This drip catcher catches NOTHING  I have to clean up a huge puddle of coffee underneath it EVERY TIme we use IT !!!! I would not recommend this pot to my worst enemy!!  What a MESS!!!"
"April 8, 2020",Sandie HHI SC,1.0,,"This coffee pot is not working correctly after only a few months.  I would like to replace it with one just like it.  I like the pot however it doesn't use all the water in the reservoir and the bar that you push against to get coffee out sometimes gets stuck and sometimes pours hot coffee all over your hands and/or the counter.  I had a Hamilton Beach coffee maker similar to this one for about 8 years.  I know they are a good quality, I think I just got a defective one."
"February 28, 2017",Trials rider,5.0,2,This is our second one of these.  Used the other one every day for years but it finally gave out.  We love the fact that there is no glass decanter to drop or clean.  Easy to top off your cup with the push of the dispenser button.  We love it.
"February 1, 2019",Sandy,5.0,,"This is my third brew station- I love the way that it makes, stores and serves your coffee BUT-You will only get about three good years out of the machine.  If you go into your purchase knowing that , you will be pleased"
"July 22, 2018",ladyyank,3.0,,It works well and it's handy to get one cup at a time.  I have decided not to use it because it is taller than I thought it would be and I would have to keep sliding it out and back to fill it and empty it because the top lid hits the upper cabinet.. Eventually it would make marks on my counter.
"June 12, 2016",dendoodledee,2.0,9,"I really wanted to love this. Not having a carafe was the selling point. I seem to dribble coffee all over the counter and thought this would solve my problem. However, the way you add water is cumbersome, the heating plate being in the middle of the reservoir lends itself to splashing on the counter or out the hole and down the front of the machine where the coffee is dispensed. The most awkward part is being so tall you have to pull out from underneath the cabinets to fill. This I thought would be less aggravating the more I used it, I did think I'd get used to the ergonomics and notice them less and less as time went by. I also thought the coffee was way too hot. If I wanted to drink straight away I had to put a few ice cubes in the cup before I poured the coffee. One time I forgot and scalded my tongue on the first cup. My previous Hamilton Beach had a temp button - too bad this one doesn't. The deciding factor to return this maker was the boiling coffee and the burnt taste. The boiling starts soon after making a batch. The first time I heard it was a full 12 cups. It boils whether you make 12 cups or 6. The first time I heard the noise I didn't know it was the coffee pot, when I tracked it down I was astonished once I realized how hot this thing gets. When you watch the video you'll also get a view of the condensation pouring down the back that other reviewers have complained about. Turn up your volume. Burnt Boiled coffee - not my cup of tea."
"March 30, 2020",Dirk Benedict,5.0,,Pretty good machine so far. I had a similar one years ago that lasted over five years. We moved to a k cup brewer that broke around every year getting replaced all of the time. Decided to go back to a drip style. So far so good. The price is great also. The iced coffee option works really well on the top.
"August 7, 2018",david r.,5.0,,Searched for and purchased this coffee maker on Amazon after using my daughter in law's for a week while on vacation.  Makes wonderful coffee in minutes.  No glass carafe to break or clean.  Has a programable clock timer and light.  I enjoy it each morning.
"December 30, 2019",Edna H.,1.0,,"Bought this Oct 30th as a Christmas gift.  Opened it on Christmas day and found lid attaching point broken.  Decided to use it anyway,  Then found out the Coffee Maker will not shut it's self off. Coffee continues to boil. Now the time to return it has passed. Not really fair if you buy something to be a Christmas gift that can't be returned. It could  burn your house down if you use it and don't watch it."
"March 16, 2021",Superduty,1.0,,As I unpacked coffee maker I noticed right away the cheap build quality .But did set up and use makes an ok cup of coffee but when you push your mug in to fill the whole coffee maker moves . Just cant get past the fit and finish not to mention the thing moving everytime you fill a mug. How annoying !!!! So back it went and i exchanged for the Cuisinart DCC 3000 its more money but you get what you pay for
"March 14, 2016",LC Gus,5.0,,"I really like the fact that it stores the coffee within itself until you decide to fill a cup up and the ease of selecting how much you want. The delay start timer thing has to be pressed twice  to make green light come on and work properly. It is really nice not to have to worry about breaking a carafe and it keeps the coffee hot enough for me for the entire 4 hour period I programmed. So much better than the ones I tried before, I love it! . If I need more time to keep the coffee hot I trick it with about a half cup of water (no more coffee) and let it brew like it wants to and I get another 4 hours of delicious hot coffee."
"March 14, 2017",Mike McCarty,5.0,One,"We've had 3 of these coffee makers over the years, and this one is the best by far. Had a problem with previous model, dispenser bar was difficult to use, and eventually broke. Especially like the bold brew cycle, as it allows me to use less coffee grinds. And I love not having a glass carafe (with granite counters) always breaking them!"
"September 19, 2016",Amazon Customer,1.0,2,"I will never purchase a Hamilton Beach product again! Coffeemaker stopped working after just a few weeks. It started beeping & said ""pour water"" & water was already in the tank just like I had prepared previous uses. I tried everything to get it to recognize the water but it wouldn't. It worked fine then just wouldn't all of a sudden. I used only filtered water & the coffeemaker had no buildup of hard water nor was it dirty at all because I'm very particular about keeping it clean & it still looked brand new. Good grief it was only a few weeks since purchase! I had a similar older model but the lever for dispensing coffee stopped working entirely. I decided to give the newer model a chance hoping hamilton beach had remedied problems, but apparently not. Therefore I will not buy their products again. Very frustrating because I like the idea of the brewstation instead of the carafe but don't like the high cost of other brands. But if it doesn't work properly, it isn't worth two cents. One positive note is that Amazon is awesome about returns & I will definitely order products through them again. I would give the coffeemaker zero stars but this site wouldn't let me, therefore I gave it one."
"January 2, 2017",amazing,5.0,One,"I have never owned one before. I got this one for Christmas and it is my favorite coffee maker ever.  I love the dispenser which has a screen on the inside of the reservoir.  That way if I over fill the basket with coffee, the grounds stay in the reservoir and do not go into my cup.  Its claim to keep the coffee from becoming burned are true.  I had the warmer on for a full 4 hours and did not notice a difference in taste from the first cup.  Great machine."
"April 11, 2021",danny pestonji,3.0,,"Brewing is fast, not so hot on the first cup. The prior version I had was much better than this new design. This one was leaking, but I fixed it by tightening the screws on the bottom of the coffee housing. I really like the non Carafe version, but again the old version was 10 times better."
"November 25, 2018",Janelle Bird,4.0,,"This is a great coffee maker, only drawback is the carafe handle is plastic and hangs in a way so the brewing coffee runs over it and makes it incredibly hot and has stained it. It is very easy to use and keeps the coffee nice and hot without giving it that burnt flavor. Would buy this again"
"January 12, 2019",Tina Ross,2.0,,I bought this 2 months ago.  It never made the coffee hot; just warm.  Now it won't empty the water basin so I have less coffee brewed than I want.  The coffee does not stay warm.  I am forced to go buy a new coffee pot to replace it.
"May 6, 2015",Pelipen,4.0,,"So far, so good.  It's great to have a carafe-free programmable coffee maker. Coffee tastes pretty good (not the best).  I really wanted to buy the later HB model, which didn't require pouring the water into the coffee maker, but too many reviewers reported a leakage problem with that model. If you don't mind the little extra effort to fill the coffee maker's water reservoir, then this is just fine.  I DO, however, wish there was a higher capacity model available. This makes up to 12 cups of coffee, but I have a BIG coffee-consuming family! Still, no more coffee carafes to break, clean or store is a real plus!  Best price I found for comparable coffee makers, too."
"October 24, 2020",NVCnvc,1.0,,"I have had this coffee maker in the past and liked it a lot, this one leaks coffee down the front abd makes a mess.  It should have a 1 year guarantee but order said expiration date  to return was a month.  Will not buy again."
"February 10, 2019",Rob D.,2.0,,"We purchased this coffee maker after our old Cuisinart bit the dust. For the most part, the Hamilton Beach operates as expected, brews quickly and at least initially, the brewed coffee tastes normal. However, because the coffee is kept warm by a small metal plate inside the coffee tank, it does not take long for the coffee to taste like it's been sitting on the burner for hours. The ""Keep Warm"" function allows settings from 1-4 hours, but I can't imagine trying to drink anything that's been sitting in there for longer than half an hour."
"May 17, 2019",Paul Ricks,5.0,,"I really like this iteration of the Hamilton Beach Brew Station (the one without the side reservoir is OK, but not as convenient). It makes great coffee, is easy to use and easy to clean. LOVE IT!"
"March 31, 2021",Virginia Davis,1.0,,I have had a different model of this exact coffee maker aside from it not getting hot enough it was great. We decided we needed a new pot and went with this one. Within 2 uses it started leaking whenever the button was used to dispense the coffee. This was extremely frustrating for us as a family of 5 and needing to clean the counter top everytime we got a cup of coffee.
"July 4, 2018",Joe G.,2.0,,"I loved this coffee maker at first, but then issues appeared pretty much immediately. Two main issues for me are: 1) You can't really make 12 cups. I like to use a lot of coffee to make it strong, but the design makes it so the coffee grinds get stuck in the hot water drip dispense, making a big mess after every batch. The only way to avoid the mess is to use less coffee and make about 6 cups. No thanks. 2) The dispenser button is amazing at first but eventually it stopped working and coffee barely comes out as a drizzle. Now I can't dispense all the coffee. The dispensing filter is clogged, and of course it's a part that cannot be replaced. It's going in the trash today."
"December 16, 2020",Kindle Customer,5.0,,I can't find anything to complain about! Makes good tasting coffee and its easy to clean. Coffee stays warm for about 4 hrs. My husband sets it up at night to have coffee ready for us in the morning.
"December 14, 2019",Shopping Grandma,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. I love that there is no external pot that needs to be washed and that my coffee is protected from everything by being covered. Easy to set or change. This is a replacement one for me because I moved and this version has a handle for easy carrying of the water reservoir for filling.
"April 17, 2018",Regor,5.0,,"fantastic, this is probably my favorite coffee maker ever !  Love the way it comes apart to make coffee, and clean up. Keep the coffee hot and ready to serve. So great not having to have a pot to pour a cup of coffee. I have a glass pot to tap the large cutting board and then no coffee in a cup, but all over the floor and on the counter. Not a way to start a day...."
"July 19, 2019",NANCY RICHARDS,5.0,,"Love how easy filling the reservoir. Actually leave it in place and fill with a pitcher. Flavor depends on brand of coffee bought on Amazon which is Yuban Medium, terrific value! Also love the SS look which is easier to see. Use 2/3cup grounds for 10 cups water. DELISH with ID Hazelnut creamers ordered!"
"November 1, 2020",Geoff,1.0,,Literally the worst coffee pot I've ever owned. This is my favorite type and series of coffee pot and my other one went out after 5 years! This one brand new freaking leaks everywhere! You can't make a pot of coffee without having a spill of coffee under the pot! AVOID AVOID AVOID.
"October 18, 2016",easyshopping,5.0,One,"Best coffee pot I ever had.  I have owned $150.00 coffee makers and they did not come close to this.  The coffee TRULY tastes fresh for four hours.  It stays piping hot.  The ""bold"" feature works well if you like it stronger.  I never had such consistently good tasting coffee.  Bought one for my daughter as well and she lovesssss it.  Fantastic price too."
"February 18, 2016",C. Eagleson,4.0,,"I really like this pot, but I'm not giving it 5 stars for one reason: the coffee doesn't stay fresh tasting for longer than about 45 minutes to an hour. So many reviewers raved about how it keeps the coffee so well -'it doesn't. Not at all. However, that being said, it makes a great cup of coffee if you're drinking it right away. We bought this pot to cut down on the ridiculous amount of money we were spending every month on our Keurig ($136.00!)  not easy to find coffee as good as Barista Prima Columbian Supreme, but this comes really close. We're saving almost $100 per month, I can deal with that!"
"September 29, 2015",A. Wade,5.0,,"Encouraged my husband to get this and he loves it.  Hot, fresh coffee every cup. Before he would use the kind of coffee maker that had a thermal carafe to keep it warm (versus the glass pots that cook it down until the coffee taste terrible).  He thinks this is better. From the wife's perspective: Fairly attractive as far as items on the counter are concerned. Makes as a soft gurgling sound I'm not used to while its keeping the coffee hot, but no big deal - just to let you know it doesn't silently sit there while keeping the coffee hot/ready like the glass or carafe kind of coffee maker."
"January 5, 2021",Catra,1.0,,I have used this particular coffeemaker for years and this is my third one because I loved this product. My most recent purchase of one though seems I got a used one or a dud...it leaked by dispenser after About a week of using it. I am constantly wiping drips of coffee from counter after filling my cup. I would have sent it back but did not keep the box.
"May 13, 2019",Feliza Hsu,1.0,,"It's a nice budget coffee maker, the only problem is it won't stay hot, no matter how I tried to set the hours for staying hot, it will turn  cold right way, so I ended up reheating in the microwave oven.  It's not that big of a deal, so I didn't bother to return it. I am not sure if all of them are like that or it's just my bad luck."
"October 8, 2019",Ks,3.0,,"This does not come close to the temperature of the old sharper image Hamilton brew station. The old one also had an easy spout to pore the coffee into a container. This one does not, only a hole in each corner that spills out onto the counter. The removable fill is good and easy see the water measure. However the fact the it only is tepid  coffee when done is a major disappointment."
"January 29, 2021",M. Finnegan,5.0,,Easy to use and clean. Like the fact you don't need a coffee pot. The windows on each side show how much coffee is left. Keep warm feature was one of the reason for this purchase.
"April 9, 2016",Antonio Kuilan,5.0,,"Fantastic coffee maker for the home office/lab. A couple of tips: 1. After brewing and wanting to add more water or going to brew a new batch, don't swing open the top lid as accumulated water droplets will fall out. FIRMLY tap the top of the lid twice with your hand before opening. This detach the water droplets due to condensation. 2. While the push for coffee button is sweet, consider placing the unit against the wall, using velcro on the bottom, or instruct others to rest one hand on top while using the other to push their mug. This will domesticate those office users who are brutal with appliances."
"September 12, 2017",monkev,5.0,,I purchased this about 1 year ago and have used it daily. It keeps the coffee hot for up to four hours without the burnt taste of a traditional glass drip pot. The bold setting takes a little longer to brew but provides a wonderful flavor. I set it every night so my pot is hot and fresh when I wake up. The cleaning and maintenance are easy although the actual pot must be hand washed.
"February 27, 2020",Amber,1.0,,"I had the older version which lasted two years, this one lasted about a month before it stopped working properly. I have to hit the power button multiple times per brew to finish, and it's super inconvenient."
"June 10, 2021",Lloyd J. Duhon Jr.,2.0,,"Made two delicious pots. Next morning did not power on. Unit was dead. Amazon customer service sending replacement... my last brew station lasted 5 years, hope I just got a 🍋 lemon, will update when replacement arrives..."
"April 2, 2019",Christina s.,2.0,,Very convenient way to make and store hot coffee however the coffee doesn’t brew really hot and the warmer in my opinion needs a tuneup you just don’t get a hot cup of coffee 2 creams and your coffee is iced coffee. And the top where you pour in the water was broke.
"February 5, 2018",Sydni Van Horn,1.0,One,"For about a week this coffee maker worked well. Then one day it leaked all over the counter top and there appeared to be a crack. Luckily I had purchased the warranty so you would think it would be covered right? Wrong. I wrote up a claim explaining that we are unaware of how the crack happened as nobody dropped it and they told me that ""accidental damage"" isn't covered. Well that was a pointless purchase of both the coffee maker and the warranty."
"December 12, 2019",Becker12,2.0,,This coffee maker makes great coffee! I bought this to keep my coffee warm. The first week no problem but I didn’t make a full pot of coffee and drank what I made almost immediately. It became a problem when I didn’t drink all of my coffee and left coffee in the holding tray. It eventually leaked out and spread all over my counter. Originally thought I had done something wrong but it has happened several times now. I now make sure nothing is left in the holding tray once I’m done with my coffee.
"February 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I had one of these in the past and was very happy with it. Thus, I purchased another. This one has a leak somewhere. so I find coffee under it each day. Very sad about that. This company has always made a quality product"
"August 28, 2019",Carrie,2.0,,"This is a very noisy coffeemaker while it's keeping the coffee warm. Also, by the time you get to the last couple cups, they taste burnt, no different than the traditional coffee maker. In addition, it quit working after a month. It no longer would brew all the water placed and would only brew in spurts, after removing and replacing water reservoir. Overall not impressed with the quality of this product. Would not buy again."
"January 20, 2020",Linda,5.0,,I love love love this coffee maker.  I've had other models of the Hamilton Beach Brew Stations for the last several years but unfortunately they don't last and end up leaking.  I swore I wouldn't buy another one but I came across this model and decided to buy it.  The price was reasonable.  It is so easy to use to make the coffee and clean up afterwards.  I am not sorry I bought it and hopefully it will last a long while.  Highly recommend at this time.
"August 5, 2014",Jasmine.Isabel,5.0,,I am horrible when it comes to breaking glass objects.  So my husband was set against a coffee maker with a glass carafe.  We had a metal one before but it never seemed to get hot enough.  I had a friend who had one of these before so I knew it was wonderful.  We've been using this brewstation for almost 6 months now and it has certainly stood up to our daily wear and tear.  It keeps the coffee hot and the taste it wonderful.  I love the programmable setting so the coffee is ready when I wake up.  I also bought a second one as a present and my friend loves it as well!
"August 20, 2020",Carla B.,1.0,,Purchased in May to use in my motor home.  First time to use it in May coffee would barely come out.  Went on another trip last weekend and now nothing will come out!  The bar that you press has fallen down.  Amazon won't take it back because of the time frame.  I only used the thing a total of 6 times!  Called  Hamilton Beach and they are closed.  Sent them an email 4 days ago. *****Hamilton Beach answered my email!!!  They are sending a replacement!!!  Hope this one is made better! ******
"April 30, 2021",Rose,1.0,,"We had a hamilton beach coffee pot previously, and after a few years it started leaking.  We replaced it with this model.  The design is so bad that it leaks out of the button that is used to dispense the coffee.  We have to put it over the sink in the morning, but there is still a puddle (read lake) of coffee when we push the maker back to the wall.  Do not buy this coffee maker."
"July 15, 2020",knm,5.0,,"I just wish these coffee pots would last forever.  With daily use during the virus, it is getting a real workout, so this isn't out first one.  I just hope they keep making this model."
"September 29, 2018",Paulasuee,1.0,,"This coffee maker was amazing the first run.  The second time I used it,  the nozzle that dispenses the coffee from inside got stuck open while I was pouring a cup, and I had 6 cups of coffee on my countertop and floor before I could get it to stop.  That's happened the 3rd and 4th time as well,  so I haven't used it since.  I passed the return window with amazon by a few days, as I left town for 2 weeks right after I got it and didn't get a chance to try it, so I guess there's nothing I can do but cut my losses on a fairly expensive brew system.  The idea of an internal holding system was nice,  but not if I have to stick my hand under piping hot coffee to unstick the nozzle, or mop my floors every time I want coffee.  I'll pass on this brand next time unfortunately."
"December 13, 2018",Joe nuskie,4.0,,So far this coffee maker is working good. Only complaint is I wish it had a light so you could see coffee cup being filled. It’s dark where cup is being filled and easy to overfill. Pretty easy to use and clean. Been using about a month and like it. Update: been using it for 15 months. Working great! 1-12 cups. So nice. Coffee still tastes great. Still wish it had dispenser light.
"August 30, 2020",JERRY HATTON,2.0,,Maybe I received a defective model because the very first time I used it the noise was so loud . My husband kept asking me why was it so much louder when brewing coffee than our last one and I said I don’t know but we kept using it . Now 3 months later it is in the trash. It started leaking coffee behind it onto to counter every day then the heating element started to get coffee coagulated there and sticking . Don’t but this model .
"June 23, 2019",Cathy,1.0,,Had a Hamilton brew station for several years and it started leaking around the dispenser. The leaking became progressively worse so I ordered the same maker anticipating that it would last for at least a couple of years. It has not been six months and it is leaking profusely. I would not recommend this coffeemaker. I will be purchasing another brand.
"March 26, 2016",W.E. N.,4.0,,"It does a nice job.  The filter basket with many holes eliminates the problems with fine-ground coffee in a coffee maker with only one hole in the basket. The heated coffee tank works well.  We like the option to keep the coffee hot up to four hours.  The dispenser works with all but the tallest of mugs. It does take a bit longer to clean up than a carafe-type of coffee maker. We have not yet tried an internal (optional) water filter.  A little concerned about trapping water in the bottom, in the bottom, after brewing. It brews fast, so I think it is better to let it finish before getting the first mug of coffee."
"March 23, 2015",Reviewer,5.0,,"Update: 3 years later and I still use the same product. Still works great, updated from 4 to 5 stars. The ONLY ""issue"" I'd say is that there is a metal mesh screen used as a second layer of protection stopping coffee grounds from going into your mug. Over a lot of use it has slowly been getting more clogged and is very difficult to completely clean. Therefore, coffee pours out slightly slower than before. That is the only issue after 3 years of daily use. I've owned it for about 2 months now and everything has been working as explained, would recommend. Only a couple things I'd saw about it. Pros: Pretty simple to clean and prep for the next day. Coffee filter comes out really easily and doesn't leave grains in the holder. Also you get no coffee grounds in your coffee due to the filter that pours the coffee which is great. The instructions it comes with are very clear on how to use properly. Cons: The metal that keeps the coffee warm after being brewed stained within the first use so it doesn't have that nice clean look inside, but I haven't noticed it changing the taste of the coffee. I tried to clean it after each use, but it needs to be scrubbed really hard to get it off and it really isn't worth it. Also, it doesn't hold any power, so if you do unplug it and need to plug it back in, it will lose what time it is, and any other settings, not a big issue but something to know."
"November 3, 2019",Becky Hamrick,1.0,,"I have purchased at least 5 Brew stations from Hamilton Beach, and have always loved them. They are great coffee makers, but this model started leaking 2 months after I purchased it. I called Hamilton Beach who sent me a new carafe. I have had the new one for just a couple of months, and it's also leaking. This particular model (48464) is not like the rest of them. Not only does it leak but, it also makes noise the whole time it is on. I would not recommend it to anyone."
"September 13, 2015",A. Schmoll,5.0,,"You know that carafe that sits there collecting coffee stains and cooking your coffee, and that overcooked last cup that you can't bring yourself to pour out? They're history. This coffee maker has put our k cup brewer on the short list for retiremwent because my husband and I drink a lot of coffee at odd times but now we can make a pot and three or four hours later still enjoy a good cup of coffee  This is much more economical and we have better control of our coffee and filter quality as well  There is condensation under the lid, but we wipe it with a towel when we open it to keep water off countertop"
"December 30, 2020",John Wells,2.0,,"I like the variable keep warm feature. Screen in bottom of coffee reservoir clogs, cannot be removed and is next to impossible to clean. Results in coffee pouring excruciatingly slow. Leaks occasionally. Going back to a better designed one I had before."
"December 18, 2014",Crystal,5.0,,"My previous older model Hamilton Beach gave up its ghost after years of faithful coffee making.  The little trooper was retired and I took the opportunity to get this upgraded mode.  I have had this coffee maker for a little while now and it is awesome.  It is easy to set up, fill and program.  It brews quickly and  I find it is quiet enough to make at night or early morning when people are sleeping.  No burned coffee taste and it keeps coffee warm for up to four hours after brewing is complete.  I would but this again but the only thing I wish they would change is that they could have made it a couple inches taller to accommodate the basic travel size mugs."
"April 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I originally had this coffee pot for 5 years and loved it. Over time it started to have a slower drip and I decided to purchase a new one.  When I received my new machine it leaked all over the counter and I barley got any coffee from out. I knew this wasn't the case with my original one so I was able to easily replace the whole machine for a new one and this one works perfect. I love that their is no glass pot to clean or break.
"October 12, 2016",Tad Karmesh,5.0,4,"FULL DISCLOSURE:  We paid the full listed price and received no discounts. I purchased this ""older"" model (48464) as a factory re-certified coffee maker for $29, about $10 cheaper than a new item from Amazon Prime.  The note included with the machine stated it was re-certified in the USA by local folks at the facility in North Carolina.  I ordered it on a Sunday and it arrived the following Tuesday.  Pretty darn good for a non-Prime order!  It came in the original (but new) box showing correctly what's inside.  A label on the outside indicated it was rebuilt in August 2016.  The coffee maker showed zero signs of previous use and i would not have been able to tell it from a new product. The is our second Brew Master.  The one it replaced is 5+ years old and tired.  It pretty much got used every day for 2-4 brewings but the dispense rate got slow and no amount of cleaning would resolve this.  Brewed coffee is rather oily and overtime can build up around the small parts of the dispensing mechanism.  This can lead to a slow dispensing rate as well as a tendency to drip a bit after you remove your cup.  Hamilton Beach recommends the usual vinegar and water mix to remove scale buildup that might occur in the pump and dispensing lines and they also recommend an overnite soak of hot water and 2 tablespoons of automatic dishwasher detergent.  Whichever method you use, be sure to run at least 2 full brewing cycles using plain water.  Also, if you have the time, run a plain water cycle through the machine after a week's use as a preventative measure. This model is obviously an improvement over our previous model.  The LCD screen is much easier to see, it has brew https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-48464-Capacity-Brewstation/dp/B001K66LPQ/ref=sr_1_13?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1544104775&sr=1-13&keywords=hamilton+beach+coffee+makersettings that actually work---if you like a stronger brew you can select ""BOLD""  and it slows down the rate at which hot water is poured into the brewing basket.  It has a timer to shut off the heating element.  There is also a 1-4 cup setting that slows down the rate but not quite as much as the BOLD setting.  If you're an iced coffee lover (we are), you can actually make a pot of ice cold coffee.  Basically, you double the amount of coffee, select the ICED brew, and fill the empty dispensing tank with ice cubes.  Then just brew up a pot of  iced coffee!  Easy Peasy. The brewing basket has many brewing holes unlike our old model which has just one hole for the coffee to drip through.  This model also has an automatic shut off gizmo which stops the flow of hot water if you lift the lid during the brewing cycle, like you might do to add some more coffee.  The old model did not have this feature.  This machine is the 12 cup version while our old machine was a 10 cup model.  We found that if you brewed 10 cups in the old one, it made a mess with splashed coffee grounds.  Brewing 10 cups in this one did not make a mess.  We have not tried to brew 12 cups. Perhaps it is because this is the taller 12 cup model, but you can dispense coffee into one of those tall travel cups.  Our old 10 cupper did not have the clearance to do this. Lastly, all Hamilton Beach Brew Master machines do in fact keep the coffee hot for a longer period of time without imparting that burnt taste. This is a great machine with a proven track record for reliability.  It's inexpensive and highly recommended for all coffee lovers. The only nit to pick is this is not truly a one hand dispensing operation.  Once you get the available coffee down to 4 cups or so, you'll need to use your other hand to stop the machine from sliding when you push your cup against the dispensing button.  The sleeker your counter top is, the greater the tendency to slide,  A non-issue. [UPDATE 12-18] After almost 3 years of daily use, the heating element died.  This means there is no heat to keep the brewed coffee warm resulting in trips to the microwave (several reviewers have complained that it doesn't keep the coffee hot even when the heating element is working.)  Personally, I don't care for microwave re-heated coffee so this Brew Station is kaput.  I also noted shortly after receiving it back in 2016 that the tank which holds the brewed coffee was a little wobbly when in place.  Also, it developed a drip after using the push bar to dispense a cup of coffee----fortunately, the drips drop into an easily removed base which is simply rinsed out. So, all things considered would I buy this again?  Yes I would and I did.  This time, however, I ponied up a couple bucks for the 3 yr replacement plan."
"February 7, 2020",Hard 2 impress,5.0,,"Absolutely the best coffee maker. Fully recommended, zero issues. I have 3 of this and all of them are working awesome. The oldest one I have still runs like new since bought 6 years ago"
"December 16, 2020",JBGarrett,1.0,,"This is our 3rd Hamilton Beach coffee maker in 10 years - love the internal storage concept.  Stays hot in carafe for up to 4 hours. Have noticed a slight plastic taste in the coffee with this model. Would NOT recommend this model, it has a constant leak when dispensing that is a manufacturer defect and is not repairable. Will be returning for a full refund and purchasing a different brand."
"April 25, 2018",PurpleGirl2016,2.0,,"Water reservoir is very large and cumbersome. It is hard to pour the water into the base.  You need a very high clearance when you open the top to make the coffee.  Also, the space between the dispenser and the drip plate is too short for my travel mug; it did not completely fit under the dispenser.  When I pushed the dispensing bar, the brew station slide on my counter.  It did make a decent cup of coffee. I am returning this product."
"August 30, 2018",Nikki Z,1.0,,"This coffee pot was a gift for my sister for her birthday. It leaks water when it needs cleaned, then coffee when it doesn't. Ants love it. And to be honest, the concept is awesome, but if you set the timer to make coffee for the morning, all the water leaks out. Very disappointed, especially with the money paid for it. She is throwing it out, and I feel terrible for putting her through all of this."
"December 23, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love this coffee station. No glass caraff to break. It keeps coffee warm for 4 hours. My husband and I get up at different times and the coffee is hot like it was just made. Highly recommended.
"July 14, 2021",sammie,3.0,,"This coffeemaker is nice but for seniors, like myself, was too big and bulky to handle. That is just my opinion and for my use it was not acceptable. I sent it back for a refund."
"March 14, 2014",Danielle,5.0,,"The reason I love this so much, is that it keeps your coffee warm without the burnt flavor, for 4 hours! Another amazing feature is that you will never have to worry about a carafe breaking & having to special order one (especially since many products out there get discontinued). It is fantastic when guests come over because they can just refill whenever they want. I do not like k-cups because they do not make strong enough coffee & in my opinion there's always an unusual flavor... this machine is so much better because you can make 12 cups in advance, and make it as strong as you want. Best kitchen appliance I have ever owned!"
"January 24, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,"This is a lot more simpler to put the water inside. It's not hard to reach like my previous ones. This doesn't have the coffee pumped up to the dispenser so it's gravity fed and I like that much better. My last one broke where you put the cup and push, and this one is built better so that should never break off. This should work out I hope."
"December 26, 2020",timothy parks,2.0,,"Have had this for over 6 months and it leaks just like my old one. Love the style, brew and everything other than water leaks out of the bottom.  I do not recommend this product."
"August 18, 2011",Karen in NC,2.0,,"No one had mentioned that while the unit is running (which is constantly in order to keep the coffee hot), there is a very quiet hissing sound of the water/coffee being kept warm. Perhaps this would not be an issue in a household that has other white noise - radio, TV, other music playing - but it was disturbing in an otherwise quiet house. And, although there was no way to track the power consumption, it just seemed like too much was being used. Also, no matter how long you left the unit turned off before opening the top to clean it, there was so much condensation built up, it dripped *a lot* all down the back of the unit. It was a mess. I'd done a lot of comparative research, so I was very disappointed that I had to return it."
"June 28, 2021",Leila P.,5.0,,"I love it, it's great!  I love the removable canister to fill up water and love that it contains the coffee inside to dispense as needed.  It's pretty quiet too."
"November 8, 2020",Nick Bliesner,1.0,,"Stay away from this product. It is a nightmare. The lever you press to dispense the coffee often gets stuck and I am constantly haveing to take it apart to correct it. Also, if it gets stuck when you are brewing the offer and are unaware, then you just have a big giant mess. I am planning to get rid of this pot and get a traditional pot. Not worth the hassle"
"April 2, 2019",Colonel Clink,3.0,,"Just got my third unit. Price is good. A major problem is that there is a small filter in the brewed tank that stray coffee grounds tend to plug and restricts flow into the cup. This is not a serviceable, you must purchase a new tank or coffee maker."
"January 24, 2021",warren wittig,1.0,,Received replacement for coffee maker ordered in mid Jan. replacement has same fault  Coffee runs down back side of creating a mess Fills drip tray and have to wipe back side where coffee ran down. purchase this item to replace my original pot which was doing what this new pot does. Original pot was several years old when the fault started this coffee did it on the first cup. Both the first pot and replacement have same fault. Recommend not purchasing the Hamilton Beach brew master very poor  quality
"June 14, 2021",Teufelz,4.0,,"Works great and not having to have a ""Coffee Pot"" is nice but it seems to drip a little bit after you use the dispenser. Overall a good unit for the cost though"
"June 29, 2015",Edward Jasudowich,4.0,One,"I love the Hamilton Beach coffee makers. I have two, this one and another that makes either 12 or 1 cup.  They work great, they are well made and they brew the coffee ""robustly"", just the way I like it. My only issue is they have many small groves that are a bit hird to clean. Each of the two I own are almost the same in that regard. I am still looking for a good solution for cleaning the smaller groves in the basket and for this device in the coffee well."
"March 21, 2021",Timmy tim,2.0,,"Doesn't keep the coffee hot. Just warm. Brews nice and slow for a good flavor.  The warmer is just that, warm.  After 3 months it does not brew a full pot. Only stuck at 1 to 4 cup bro.. Poor quality"
"October 9, 2018",Wade Ragsdale,5.0,,"Love this machine. Only have 2 things that I wish were different , the bottom tray , under where you fill your cup at. The metal drip try falls out to easy. And after using it for awhile now. the words at the front of the machine, are starting to come off . Thats not that big a deal either. It has no impact on how the machine works at all. It works great. This is my second one. My first one lasted 10 years. Hoping this one will also."
"October 4, 2016",DragonTear,5.0,2,Lovely this is a  great buy.  The only complaint is that it is a little hard to get large travel mugs under it and see where the fill line is.  So a couple time I have overfilled it and spilled a bit.  But it easy to clean and work wells. Fits on my counter well and makes good coffee.  I really enjoy it.
"March 18, 2014",Shauna,5.0,,I think this is an Awesome coffee station because there's no coffee pot to break and I ALWAYS broke the pot. It is a bit much for just myself to have to make coffee because I always find myself making WAY to much! I'm probably not used to being single yet but it's a great coffee station though and there's different options like keeping it warm for up to 4hrs and making it bold and even programing it to make coffee so you get woke up by the aroma of fresh coffee. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Really recommended to ppl with arthritis in your hands like me because there won't be anymore broken glass! Definitely a great purchase for about $40 you can't go wrong!
"March 20, 2018",Carol mccann,5.0,,"I had this same coffee maker for 12 years and i just bought another just like it. my old one was still working fine i just thought it was time to get a new one in case the old one quit working it would take a while to get this one on line. i looked in the stores and couldn't find this exact model. the Hamilton beach models  i found in the stores had added features,were a little bigger . But very cheep, light weight feeling. Slid across the counter when i pushed my coffee cup against to get coffee out . so i returned the other model from the store and bought this model just like my old one on line and love it."
"April 9, 2017",West1134,5.0,One,"Our Mr. Coffee broke after just a year (heating element sensor) and we decided to try this based on the reviews.  We absolutely love it! Its nice not having to deal with a pot, easy to put a mug or travel mug under it and fill. Hopefully it lasts longer than our Mr. Coffee did (only been a few months)."
"April 29, 2021",Amy Mott,5.0,,I already has 2 of these and just purchased another 2 for my church. So great especially due to Covid-19 and needing everything to be hands free. Highly recommend.
"June 27, 2021",Mike,1.0,,"Product lasted right up until Amazon’s return window closed.  Returns closed June 25, coffee pot started leaking terribly on June 27th.  We replaced our first brew station (which began leaking water from under it) after almost 4 years of use, got this one hoping for at least another four years, this one lasted just passed 30 days, before it started pouring coffee out of the spout without it being pressed."
"August 18, 2015",Michael,3.0,,"This is the second coffee maker of this style we had purchased as we liked the convenience of the dispenser.  Additionally, being able to remove the water reservoir was a big plus at this makes it much easier to fill and doesn't cause the coffee maker to need as much cleaning, as you're not filling from a dirty carfare.  We eventually had to get rid of it though because as many others had explained it began leaking uncontrollably.  I'd come down in the morning to a 1/4 pot and the rest of the water spread out on the counter top and floor.  It seems due to calcium build up in the lines but we cleaned ours pretty frequently and this was still an issue.  If you have soft water you might not run into this."
"August 11, 2019",Mary Rasp,2.0,,"We had loved it until then, and I had left a glowing review. We were very disappointed that the coffee maker that I had carefully shopped for suddenly quit after 4 months - It didn’t last as long as a ten dollar coffee maker."
"June 26, 2020",Lisa Palmer,2.0,,"We’ve had Hamilton Beach Brew Stations since about 2004 and didn’t hesitate to buy this new model, we bought 2, making these the 6th and 7th we’ve had serving multiple residences.  The first one stopped pumping the water to make a full pot after a month.  The second one stopped pumping the water to make a full pot at 6 months.  We Do not recommend this model.  Hamilton Beach needs to remove this from the market and redesign."
"January 15, 2016",Daddy of Twins,5.0,One,"Second one I've owned. After a year with the new one, I'm still loving it! They fixed the two main issues that the older model had: 1) The pour spout is twice as large now. So gunk can't clog the stream as easily. 2) They repositioned the lid so that the pooling down the back is 95% better, I'd say. And lastly, because I didn't clean the old one often, the stream issue happened at about year one. So I now clean this new one with vinegar about every month. Love love, love it. I bought mine for around $50 and still feel good about the purchase."
"September 16, 2013",DeployGuy,5.0,,"My wife and I like different kinds of coffee so we have two of these in constant use.  With this frequent hard use they last about 18 to 24 months.  We have worn out 2. But as was said, extremely heavy daily use. Easy to clean and prep. That's why we bought them again.  No stupid carafes, just put the cup under the spigot and push, Walla! A full cup of coffee, hot, ready, it's all good. Up to 12 cups but you can make less if desired.  Auto power works, shuts off after the set interval which can be up to 4 hours. You like your coffee, you want it now?  Get this. Good buy.  Same model has been available for years."
"May 28, 2018",Carolyn G,1.0,,"Awkward to use. I returned it. When dispensing the coffee it’s hard to see in the cup to tell if the cup is full. There’s a very bright lights on the front of the panel programming because there should be a light shining down so you can see how much you forward in the cup.  The whole set up is awkward to use, coffee is not hot enough."
"February 27, 2020",tim gilpin,4.0,,"This product is so easy to use, easy to clean, esay to load. It's plain easy. One draw back, is that, if you have the larger travel mugs, they don't fit under the spout. As you can see the pic. I would recommend this product to everyone."
"July 26, 2019",LH,3.0,,Love the coffee pot but it only makes about 7 cups.  Everything else is fine.  It makes very good iced coffee.  I had an older model that was a 10 cup and it made 10 cups.
"March 28, 2020",TriGirlInBlue,1.0,,"I like the concept of this type of coffee maker- with a reservoir. But I have 2 issues with this particular brand. 1. It’s hard to find a reusable filter that fits. 2. When I push the button to pour my coffee, the coffee leaks down the side of the coffee maker. Every single time. I have to put a dish rag down to catch the leakage. I’ve only been using this coffee maker for a week and I will be replacing it as soon as I can."
"February 1, 2021",nancyann,4.0,,this is my 3rd of this coffee maker- it lasts about 2 years- the lever used to  fill your coffee mug is plastic and eventually it breaks-- other wise good for the money
"May 15, 2021",Lee Chapman,5.0,,"This coffeemaker does a great job.  I use it everyday to make a full pot, which it keeps good and hot for hours.  It will keep coffee hot for 4 hours and can even be extended beyond that."
"May 12, 2020",Guest,1.0,,"The dispensing ""bar"" that must be pushed against by mug to fill is a terrible design--requires far too much pressure, which causes whole unit to slide back on the counter.  If you reach to hold the back of the unit while pushing to dispense, you will burn yourself on the top of the unit unless you use a potholder or towel.  Really poor design, it is now in the garage."
"July 17, 2019",Deborah,4.0,,"Overall, I like the product.  the only drawback that I have encountered is that when the coffee is ""dripped/spilled"" from the push bar coffee dispenser, the below ""grate"" that is to collect the spilled coffee does not work properly.  Coffee spills under the coffee maker, as the spill grate is not designed properly.  I had a coffee maker similar to this one from another company and never had that problem.  That company was no longer making the model I liked, so I decided on the Hamilton Beach model...  that would be the only thing I do not like about the coffee maker.  It's amazing to me that a product gets to market with this type of flaw.  ???"
"July 12, 2016",Autumn Shyne,5.0,One,"Brew that coffee! I got this for work. It's great because it's keep the coffee warm in a hidden compartment in the center of the coffee maker. No more dirty glass pots to worry about. You just press your mug against the despensing trigger and fill till you hearts desire! Well... Up to 12 cups, anyway. Much more sanitary than the regular coffee maker."
"July 1, 2019",Redlouts73,5.0,,"I'm really happy with this maker.  I love that the coffee is stored in the machine.  It keeps the coffee very hot, which I like.  It's easy to program and clean too!"
"December 21, 2020",Emily Hansen,3.0,,"I purchased this BrewStation after seeing someone on Instagram buying their 4th one...that should have been a clue! This is an awesome coffee maker and cool set up (5 stars) while it lasts. Now in December it is leaking coffee all over my count too. The leak appears to be coming from the heat plate. The price is not bad, I think I paid around $40, however, I would have expected at least a couple of years use out of it."
"September 24, 2020",marladell,4.0,,ive had a couple of these in the last ten years. very happy with the over all no glass to break ..easy to use. however none of the keep the coffee very hot
"January 23, 2021",Melinda W.,1.0,,"This is my 3rd Hamilton Brew Station - we are a household that makes 3-4 pots of coffee a day, so needless to say we wear them out. We have loved ours before, however, this one leaks right out of the box. I made the mistake of pushing the dispense button with my finger instead of my cup and needless to say burned my finger due to the leak. It leaks everytime you dispense a cup of coffee. Have only had the maker for a few days and am already shopping for a new coffee pot."
"January 26, 2020",KB,3.0,,"Good machine as a coffee station. Like the other reviews, it seems to collect water around it but not leak and has hot lid.  For the price, good coffee maker and produces great tasting coffee."
"April 10, 2018",Judi,5.0,,"This is the longest lasting coffee maker I've ever owned. The first one lasted 9 years with daily usage. I love that there isn't a coffee pot. Coffee dispenses right into your cup or mug. The only issue I had was not with the coffee maker, but with the filter basket that the seller provided for free. It was a nice gesture, but the permanent filter is the size for a 4-6 cup unit."
"December 31, 2020",happymom,5.0,,"Love the ease of use. The side location of the water basin is way better than pouring water into a pot. We use this brew station  daily for our hot, morning coffee, and enjoy the keep warm feature for our late risers. It stands the test of time! This is the third time buying this model, we love it!"
"March 21, 2016",F.G. Summer,5.0,,"I had the old brewstation years ago.  It died a natural death because we must have had it for 4 years, due to everyday wear and tear.  That old one started to leak when it dispensed the coffee so we had to get rid of it and replaced it with another brand that we got as a gift.  The replacement did not last long because the carafe broke, so I shopped for another brand that had a stainless steel carafe.  That one died in 2 years, so now I'm back to our old reliable brewstation.  I had forgotten how the coffee tasted great and now I am reminded.  I am enjoying my morning cup of coffee again.  I highly recommend this product!"
"May 18, 2016",elizabeth hogue,3.0,One,"This is my second one of these.  I loved the first, having had it 1 1/2 years, and will take it to our lake cottage.  This one however seems to keep cooking, I can hear it, during the warming period, thus making the coffee stronger.  That was a primary objective, to warm but not cook as a carafe would do.  I am thiinking of returning it.....maybe should have got the newer model instead of the same one I  previously had."
"December 26, 2018",Paul D. Stevens,5.0,,"Had an older model for many years jbefore it started to leak....Love the new design with removable water reservoir and Bold setting. For those using a turkey baster, I haven't had that problem....Yes condensation does happen on the underside of the lid, but if you lift the lid and let it drain down the channel as designed, the water drains back into the coffee reservoir.....It will only drain below the reservoir if you remove the coffee reservoir before the condensation has a chance to drain. My advice, lift the lid, wait 10 seconds for condensation to drain before removing the coffee reservoir."
"July 5, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"We had a two to go, and this takes what we love about that, and adds onto it. Water fill is done via a removable water resevoir. Easy to fill coffee basket. And more."
"May 27, 2020",Jamie,5.0,,"Sadly this coffee maker doesn't last more than 2 yrs but it's fabulous! This is our 3rd one! No messing around with a carafe so you don't have to cautiously pour water in - just fill the detachable reservoir and voila! Just place your cup under the spout & ""stream"" your desired coffee amount. Recommend!!"
"February 1, 2017",Arlene Odell,5.0,One,We've been using this coffee pot for about a month; we purchased it to use in addition to our Keurig to make it easier for my husband to fill a thermos in the mornings. It works perfect for that! We set it up in the evenings and he just pulls it to the edge of the counter in the morning and fills up his thermos. The bottom tray that would normally hold a coffee cup coming off is a huge selling point for us!
"November 29, 2020",Stacy Boyd,1.0,,I have owned this particular model before and never had issues like this. The coffee pot leaks everywhere.  Under the coffee pot and literally as you put the cup under. Its been a mess.
"December 30, 2020",mach1mustangchic,5.0,,"I've had this exactly 4 years.  It was a great coffee maker.  Today was its final day.  The top ""carafe"" has a slow leak after cleaning so it keeps refilling with recycled coffee and never thinks its done making coffee.  But for the last 4 years it has held strong for every day use.  All in all its been a great coffee machine."
"October 13, 2013",Darren,4.0,,"Not the ""perfect"" coffee maker, but certainly a good product and one worth considering. The main feature that sets this drip coffee maker apart from others is the lack of a carafe. So the big question for me and my largest concern was: is it a gimmick and does it really keep the coffee tasting fresh and hot? The answer for me now that my wife and I have owned this guy for about 4 months is yes, but with reasonable expectations. We are after all talking about a sub $50 coffee maker... let me explain: We have found that for the most part the coffee tastes great when initially brewed and that as the hours go by it continues to diminish in taste- but far more slowly than a typical carafe drip coffee maker. With our old Mr. Coffee, I wouldn't dare pour myself a cup of coffee if the pot had been sitting on that warmer plate for much more than 45 minutes. With the Hamilton Beach, I will go back and keep filling my cup a good hour and half and sometimes 2 hours after the initial brew button was pressed. Although you can set the warmer for up to 4 hours, there is a slightly noticeable difference in the taste with the older coffee - nothing like microwaved coffee, but definitely not a ""first cup"" either. Also, keep in mind that as you drain the coffee reservoir you are using the same heating element to warm a smaller amount of coffee. At some point typically around the sub 4-cup mark the quality will drop very quickly and start tasting burnt. Other things to consider: This coffee maker does not drip all over the counter and leak as some other reviewers have suggested. Perhaps in two years it will, but considering I use the coffee maker daily I will have retired this guy and moved on by then. I don't expect more than 2 years out of a coffee maker in this price point and you shouldn't either. Features: The blue LCD screen is very bright and works as a night light in my kitchen when I am up with the baby at 2 in the morning. I consider this a plus. There is a setting for BOLD, 1-4 cups, and a normal setting. Mine is always set to BOLD. :) There is a timer function for unattended startup in the early mornings. Dispensing: I have mugs of all sizes and they fit under this coffee maker and I've never had any trouble with the thickness of a mug causing any spilling or dripping. It also stops the second you take the pressure off the button and I've never had the coffee maker make another drip or two after removing the mug. I know that is also a concern that folks tend to have with this coffee maker. My Starbucks commuter cup does not fit under the dispenser, but I tip it at an angle and can fill it up just fine."
"May 1, 2021",M. Madsen,1.0,,"This was the 2nd brewstation I've bought.  The first lasted 2 yrs (far from ideal) but I liked its features.  The second one was garbage.  It leaked on the counter from the start.  I thought it might stop with a bit of usage, but alas, no."
"October 24, 2018",Emma Moore,5.0,,"Absolutely love this coffee maker. Get 12 cups of coffee in about 5 minutes between making it and it brewing. I used to have a keurig, and I will never go back. It’s so much better tasting coffee in a system like this because you can make it however dark you want it. On top of that it is so much easier to make more then one cup. I have one of the oversized mugs, and instead of having to make two keurig cups, I can simply just dispense however much I want! Absolutely get this coffee maker."
"March 2, 2021",Leslie Helfrecht,5.0,,"I have had this model for years. After ordering what was my third in about ten years in October 2020, I was so disappointed because it leaked like crazy. After two months, I was still able to return it, get another in exchange, and NO LEAKING! Delicious coffee that stays warm for hours. It seems mayyyybe HB has fixed the leak issue or I just got lucky but the return process was easy so don’t give up on this machine!"
"May 21, 2019",Dori,3.0,,"Not good for a gathering because there is no pot to pour for guests.  The one-cup dispensing bar is a bother; you have to hold the back to steady the coffee maker as you press the front with the cup in the other hand.  Okay for one or two people, but not more than that.  Coffee is coffee and tastes good.  Easy to clean.  But next time, I will buy a coffee maker with a pot."
"November 13, 2018",Travis Petty,1.0,,"This thing lasted from 3/2018-11/2018 until it started dripping into the drip tray. From there I didn't know the severity of the drip because it was on an absorbent dish rack towel... until the spongy material finally gave out. The whole counter, spanning from one side to the other was stained with stale coffee. I didn't know the severity of the leak until then. I tried to wash out the machine but the leak persisted. Looks like it is time to retire it for a 10 dollar coffee maker."
"March 6, 2021",Brandi C.,1.0,,"Don't buy this unless you want to clean puddles of coffee off your counter. This coffee pot has been so hard to clean and I regretted my purchase since it arrived. The reservoir leaked since day one and just today it completely kicked the bucket! Less than 10 months old and now the reservoir doesn't hold the coffee at all. It leaks down into the machine, out all the crevices, and all over your counter. Save your money! Don't buy this."
"July 8, 2021",M.J. Rahrig,1.0,,This is my third brew station and I am so disappointed. When I dispense coffee into the cup it leaks down the sides of the cup onto the bottom of the cup. I googled what to do for this problem and the answer I received and tried did not work. Still leaks.
"June 29, 2021",Sarah E Emig,1.0,,"This is the 2nd brew station I purchased in a year.  I returned the first one within 30 days but this last one after only 4 months of use blew the fuse and no longer works, not to mention the leaking.  The warranty terms are unsatisfactory.  This product needs some major readjustments in order to be suggested.  The replacement that Hamilton Beach wanted to provide would be less than an equal product, plus I have to pay to return it!"
"February 10, 2017",Kindle Customer,1.0,,"I wanted to love this coffee maker...I really did.  The first one I ordered started malfunctioning with in a week.  The water wouldn't pump thru, it said it needed cleaning so I cleaned it, that didnt solve it so I exchanged it.  The second one....same exact thing.  I do have well water but can't believe it would make it stop working in 4 days.  I had no problems like that with my previous coffee maker..."
"June 10, 2020",Jona,1.0,,"First it looks refurbished, the top had microscratches like it got hit with the scour side of a sponge. I can ignore that... but when I go to fill a cup the main stream comes with a flow that runs to the front of the machine every single time which then gets to the pour button and runs down the side of my cup. Throwing it away and getting something better."
"March 18, 2013",P. Michael Moffa,4.0,,"This was a purchase to replace our older brewstation which we loved. The new one has new features, such as bold, keep hot up to four hours and is more trim line. However, the tank capacity seems to me smaller. It is advertised as 12 cups, but this would be a stretch. It also is more difficult to fill the tank because of the newer sleek design. Also, it doesn't seem to make the coffee as hot as the old one did. I prefer really hot coffee, as in a perked cup, however this one just doesn't make it. Overall, it's a good coffeemaker, and am glad we purchased it. Would have given it 5 stars if the tank capacity was larger and if it brewed a little hotter."
"December 13, 2017",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I bought this model to replace the Brew Station I have been using daily for years which finally wore out. Many similarities between the new and old models. The new one is sleeker and smaller overall, taking up less counter space. It also makes GREAT coffee, just like my older one. The two things that I like less about the new model are that it is difficult to tell when my cup is getting full and that it's also hard to  see the ""MAX"" fill line inside the water chamber. These problems have resulted in spilled water and overflowing coffee mugs. I will have to learn to make certain that the light is just right so I can see water and coffee levels more clearly."
"February 11, 2020",C. Joe Clark,1.0,,"this was for just the 2 of us....and thank God we drink our coffee black, because the coffee does not come out that hot at all.  Our friend, unfortunately, uses cream, and she could not get over how ""luke warm"" it  was from the first sip.  I spent over $50 on this, and to me it's not even worth paying for shipping to send back...If noone wants it it will go in the garbage or to good will...Do not recommend this at all"
"January 25, 2021",Dominic & Ashley Lee,4.0,,Cleaning is a little harder then a standard coffee maker.  It’s not a deal changer though.  Having a clock to set coffee perk time is a plus.  The Bold feature also adds a little pep without having to use more coffee grounds.  We went from Kcups back to drip and we are glad we did.
"December 8, 2015",lorianne66,5.0,,"i had a mr coffee maker that was similar to this style before it finally broke down. I read mixed reviews on this but bought it anyways. It works fine, no problems, I dont know what people are talking about when they say it is loud.  It makes some sounds when the water is heating up and going through the machine, but to me that is to be expected and not a big deal. (my old Mr coffee maker made sounds too).  It keeps the coffee warm for up to 4 hours and it was easy to set up the time delay for morning brew. It can make as little as 2 cups of coffee with no problems."
"January 29, 2021",Beth Green,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot. The coffee comes out steaming hot and stays that way as long as you like. There is no carafe, so clean up every night is so easy. I have used a lot of different pots, so far this is my favorite."
"June 23, 2016",Mark S.,3.0,,"I like the concept of the no pot brewing. I have purchased three of the older model Brewstations since their inception. I have been satisfied with each of them. They have been improved through the design of the warmer to prevent overheating causing it leaks over time.  I have had this model in use for two days. It brews a good cup of coffee. The problem is when you try to get a cup, the pot runs away. I really mean that the cup pushing on the valve makes the pot slide across the counter."
"December 23, 2019",Helen D,5.0,,"I like the separate water reservoir.  It is the easiest model to use.  I have been using them for years.  The spring on the dispenser finally fails, but it is good for at least two years."
"December 6, 2016",Verified Customer,4.0,One,"This is a great product that produces delicious hot coffee. Simple and not ""over-smart"". MINOR design flaw: there are a few rubber traction pads on the bottom of the unit to keep it from sliding when you engage the push bar. If you need to slide it out from under your upper cabinets to fill the unit like I do (and push it back in place), the rubber pads tend to stick to the countertop, and they pull out completely.....almost every time I move it. So I either have to remove them altogether and have zero traction, or pick a (full) unit up and stick them back in, OR pick it up slightly for each move, instead of sliding it. When I commented to the manufacturer, they suggested I discard the (brand new) unit and let them send a replacement, which I didn't do, because the design hasn't changed. It's a minor inconvenience you can overcome if you like a simple but smart unit that delivers tasty hot coffee. Oh, and I have granite countertops...this may or may not be a factor."
"October 19, 2016",J. Amos,5.0,2,"Just what I wanted! No mess, no clutter just coffee. I have always loved the convenience of getting water out of the fridge and this is exectly the same except with coffee. Makes a good strong cup and easy to use,clean and set up. Very easy to program."
"November 22, 2017",Paul,1.0,,"My daughter bought this (or I did) for college.  It does ""burn"" the coffee.  My previous Hamilton Beach maker, same style but 10-12 years old, has a function that possibly intermittently applies heat??  Not sure, but my original does not seam to ""burn"" the coffee.  This one also leaked faster than my old one.  I think the spring is cheaper.  So sad!!!"
"June 1, 2021",too many technical terms for a non nerd,1.0,,"This was my 5th Hamilton Brew station that leaked.  The first one lasted a while before it started leaking and the second and third one lasted a shorter period, the fourth and fifth one started leaking immediately.  We liked the design concept and each time we thought Hamilton Beach would find the problem and realize they had a problem, but  they evidently did not care .  DO NOT PURCHASE !!!!."
"March 9, 2020",Roxanne Green,5.0,,"Makes hot, iced, bold, or weak coffee. Whatever you want. And it keeps it all hot/cold and fresh inside the coffee maker. I wish the button wasn't so hard to push. You have to have this coffee maker against a wall or it will push over."
"February 14, 2019",M. R. Schrag,2.0,One,"I love the design of this coffee maker. I like everything about it unfortunately, the coffee does not taste very good. It is not awful but it’s not good. Just saying ....You get what you pay for.The price was right so I decided to try it."
"June 24, 2021",zztekjw,5.0,,My sixth unit in twelve tears. Average life 2 yrs before leaks appear. Stained and broken glass pots sold me on this unit.  Great value for the money.
"January 5, 2021",Andy Galindo,1.0,,"I have always been a fan of the Brew Station. The ease of not having to use a craft has always made it my number 1 choice however, this is the first time I am thoroughly disappointed. Unfortunately if you do not put your coffee cup to the very top and only push the dispenser from the very bottom, coffee comes pouring out through the back of the coffee cup. I have purchased at least 5 Brew Stations over the years and this has been the worst model!!!!"
"July 15, 2016",KAT N,5.0,,This coffee maker came into our house to replace our Keurig.  The one cup at a time was killing our pocket book.  This is one of the best coffee makers I have ever owned.  It keeps your coffee hot for hours without burning it.  It is easy to clean.  Makes a great cup of coffee and is compact enough to fit on our small counter! This is a must in a kitchen!  No more cup by cup this Coffee Maker gets 5 stars from us!!!!
"May 8, 2021",ECross,5.0,,I had another one and broke it while I was taking it apart to deep clean it (don't disassemble it and take apart the screen at the bottom of the reservoir) and had to buy another one.
"June 13, 2016",Ric DePontee,5.0,2,"My single serve coffee maker died so I needed something new. Being retired now, I have more time to sit and enjoy my coffee, several cups as a matter of fact. Thus the reason a new single serve coffee maker was not going to be ideal. I set the timer to brew 1 hour before I get up. Then when I'm ready for a cup of coffee, I just put my cup under the coffee maker and walla I'm in business. Love it way more than getting a new single serve."
"January 26, 2021",Christina,1.0,,Every morning I have to push the on button several times to get it to perk The coffee in the pot does not stay hot..the bottom leaks water every pot made..and u literally have to hold the pot so it doesn’t move..because u put your mug up to it and push the dispenser...to fill mug
"January 6, 2020",Della falbo,2.0,,"I thought I would. I like the design, the side reservoir, but good gods is it loud! The whole time it is on! Drove me nuts. And it has an option to keep your coffee warm for a while....what it doesn't say is that not only does it keep your coffee warm, It Constantly Cooks It. So by the time you are near the end of the pot, it's nasty.  Yeah, Do not recommend unless you like noise. Loud Noise."
"October 25, 2020",Danielle,3.0,,"Nice features and easy to use, but the design isn't great. The button to dispense the coffee is hard to push without holding the pot in place and when you open the top, condensation drips everywhere"
"January 6, 2019",kathlee,3.0,,"It's easy to use, and have been using it for over a month now, but for some reason you can taste a plastic taste in the coffee; especially if it sits the whole 4 hours, so I probably wouldn't recommend it. Was going to immediately return it in November because it wasn't what I wanted, but kept it anyway. Realized that I have until the end of this month to return it, so we'll see."
"December 6, 2016",Leslie,5.0,,This is the 3rd coffee maker in this style we have purchased in 20 years or so... We love how easy it is and no glass carafe to break. This model has a timer and standard clock etc.. very easy to set up easy to use easy to clean. I picked this one over another because it stated it didn't have BPA (Lord knows what the other 2 ones added to our coffee) I have made as small as 4 cups but the norm for us is 12 cups (a full pot) and didn't notice any problems or taste difference. Very happy with my purchase so far!! Recommend.. heck yeah.
"December 21, 2019",Rowaida,5.0,,"I have had this machine since Dec 2013, this year, Dec 2019 it stopped working (still makes coffee but the ""push"" to get coffee out broke). What a workhorse! This is a solid machine that makes good coffee."
"November 14, 2020",marked1,5.0,,I bought this one since my other Hamilton Beach started to leak after 7-8 years of service. I really liked my other one. This has more functions and works quite well. It has a little better flavor.
"July 17, 2020",paul demos,1.0,,"Do not buy this coffee maker. After less than one month's the coffee started leaking into the coffee warming plate filling it with at least 1 cup of coffee. I had to soak it up with paper towels and a sponge. It does this every time I brew coffee. It feels very cheaply made unlike most Hamilton beach products I have purchased.  Because of Covid 19,  There is no customer phone support. I have emailed them with no response. Unfortunately I will just end up throwing it into the garbage."
"March 15, 2021",tracy stokes,1.0,,"This coffee pot brews a pot very quickly, temperature is perfect for up to 4 hours. Unfortunately it leaks internally every time you get a cup and even after filling it with water before you even brew the pot. Makes a mess all over your counter with every pot. I threw the box away after unpacking so no way to send it back for a new one or a return. I wouldn’t buy it again. Extremely bummed!"
"February 12, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"This is our second brew station.  The first one lasted a long time, but finally died.  This one is not at all like our original one.  It gets too hot.  You can actually hear the coffee boil.  The first cup tastes fine, but don't bother drinking coffee half an hour after it has been brewed - it tastes horrible.  Clearly Hamilton Beach is not familiar with the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" concept. I will probably end up retiring this coffee maker after less than two months and spend the extra money to purchase an air pot type of coffee maker."
"March 5, 2013",Kindle Customer,3.0,,"Over the past 8 years we've owned 2 of the older versions of the Brewstations (47665). My husband tended to be an early morning coffee slosher with the traditional carafe coffee pots. The Brewstations have reduced the coffee messes considerably. I'll never buy another style of coffee maker again. We've always been happy with the taste of the brews whether we grind our beans, or use pre-ground coffee.  We've never had a problem with burnt taste and I don't anticipate any problems with this newer version. We've not had any filling problems with cups of any size or thickness including my husband's large thermos for work(once we learned the correct angle of approach) The Good: The 48465 is slightly taller but much narrower.  I like the way the water reservoir is designed. It's in the lower part of the machine and is much easier to fill and has clear water level marks inside the reservoir on the left. The brewed coffee level gauges on both sides of the tank are a nice addition - they're much larger and easier to see. The feature set is nice, particularly the ability to extend the warming time past 2 hours and brewing smaller amounts of coffee. The Not So Good: This machine is much lighter-weight than the older versions. It started shaking back and forth when I started the brew cycle. There may be a warped spot in my counter but the old version sits solidly in the same spot and I can't even make wiggle it by hand. The plastic on the new one is thin, the edges aren't smooth and there are spots that look as though they were rubbed shiny. The old version has uniform, sturdier plastic and smooth seams. The lid is inset, rather than overlapping like the old one, and is off center (but does close completely) The coffee tank takes more attention to make sure it's properly seated. No more satisfying 'thunk' letting me know it's in there just right. The 48465 is nowhere near as well constructed as the 47665.  If you really don't need all the extra bells and whistles I would go for that model.  I may well order another one of those and set this one aside as a spare."
"April 26, 2020",Jessica,5.0,,"My favorite coffee pot. I had the older version & when it FINALLY quit, I was so excited to see this new version. I love it! It works perfect, easy to use & programming is easy."
"March 3, 2013",CM,5.0,,"Pros: Keeps coffee hot for up to 4 hours, without a burnt taste Easy to clean Makes good tasting, hot coffee Easy to read # of cups of water you want to add Shows how many cups you have left to drink You can use almost any size cup to pour the coffee into Cons: The lid is very tall. When I lift it up I have to to put it on the edge of the counter sideways, and then slide it back under the cabinet (but that's not a big deal) Haven't used it for large gatherings yet, but guests would either have to serve themselves, or I could use my old Mr Coffee Carafe and serve that way"
"May 30, 2021",lovetoshop,5.0,,ive always used the regular pour water in top and glass decanter and always got water and coffee all over the place. now there is no spilling of either!
"February 24, 2017",thejoyoftom,5.0,,"I cannot praise this coffee maker enough. It meets all my requirements. #1 It is easy to clean: the basket reservoir, the basket that holds the coffee filter, and the water tank lift completely out so you can take them to the sink to empty and wash. The opening of each is large enough to reach your hand in to scrub if needed #2 it's easy to fill (for the same reasons that it is easy to clean) #3 it's easy to use (It's not totally intuitive when it comes to programming. I had to read the booklet that comes with it to set the timer #4 It does have an auto shut off but at 4 hours, not 2. This was an important feature because a 2 hour shut off is just too soon for me. #5 It keeps the coffee at a good even temperature. This is important if you drink coffee over the course of the morning like I do. Of course, what difference would it make if the unit stayed on for 4 hours but didn't keep the coffee hot? And #6 It will make up to 12 cups of coffee. There are other features, like brew strength options, but the ones I've mentioned were most important to me. Like I said, I just love this coffee maker."
"January 15, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"We had a hamilton Beach coffee maker and it broke after a few years and decided to buy this one. The product itself is OK, but the spout or the dispenser is terrible. It leaks all over for most cup types. Is just terrible, requires a clean every day of the countertops. Will not recommend buying this. Not a good value at all. thinking of ditching it completely and going to a different coffee maker. Awful."
"September 17, 2016",memoryhole84,4.0,,"This is our second one. The first one lasted about 2.5 years. Great for what it does, but after a year or two, the small wire filter/screen at the bottom of the tank starts to age and clog and restrict flow to your mug. And as it's fixed in place, it's difficult (read ""impossible"") to clean and allow the flow to resume. It's a great and convenient coffee maker, just expect to replace it every two years."
"January 27, 2021",Diane Patrick,1.0,,"Do not buy. I like the coffeemaker itself, but it leaks. The first one we had worked well for a while, then started leaking. I ordered another and it leaked immediately. I sent it back and got replacement. It started leaking immediately. Not sending it back. Will just buy another brand."
"February 25, 2019",Terry,5.0,,"With this model I can see both reservoir levels, the fresh water & the brewed coffee. It is also so much more convenient with less mess to have the input water reservoir separate from the coffee pot."
"April 15, 2017",Susan A. Williams,4.0,,"I've had a few of this type coffee maker. The style avoids spilled and burned coffee. This one is very noisy, as some have said. It sputters for up to an hour after coffee is ready..but not every time. I've tried removing the water tank after brew cycle is complete, but it still sputters. The noise really doesn't bother me. I wish the detachable water tank had a removable lid so that it would fit under my refrigerator's filtered water dispenser. I will purchase another like it when this one quits."
"February 12, 2020",NativeNYer,1.0,,"i had a prior version of this coffee maker that after approximately 10 years began to leak. i was so happy with the older coffee maker that i decided to replace it with an update.  Unfortunately, this new version leaked from day 1. i truly regret that i did not return this machine while i was still able. the coffee brews well and tastes good but  it CONSISTENTLY LEAKS all over the counter. so, if you don't mind keeping a few paper towels under the machine, this is your coffee maker. buyer beware!"
"January 5, 2018",Paul Carrasquillo,1.0,One,"Lasted until today Jan 5, 2018. Water container leaks and the push bottom for the mug to be filled with coffee is completely useless. Unit will make coffee (and leak water) but there's no way to get the coffee out unless you want to scoop it out with a ladle."
"March 16, 2021",Jennifer Tropeano,1.0,,This thing leaked all over the place. When you would get your coffee the stream of hot coffee wouldn’t go into your mug. The carafe part did not sit right in the base. We’ve had this kind of coffee pot before and never had an issue with it. I guess this one was a dud
"September 20, 2020",Juergen Sczesniak,1.0,,"We bought this in May of 2020.  Shortly after the water reservoir would not completely empty to make the amount of cups.  We would have to turn it off and then back on to get it to finish.  And sometimes that did not work.  Also under the bucket that holds the brewed coffee, the fresh coffee started leaking heavily into the two compartments underneath.  In addition, you cannot push a cup against it to fill without the entire machine sliding backwards.  NOT HAPPY!"
"May 21, 2018",Jen,5.0,,We have a camper and this style coffee maker works great no glass pot to come flying off the counter when we are traveling. We had our first one for about 5 years and when that one broke 2 weeks ago we jumped on amazon and didn't hesitate to order this again.
"July 26, 2017",DeltaQuest,5.0,2,"The ""sidekick"" container for filling is a few extra bucks, but waaaaaay better than using the brew pot itself. I love it! (Workmanship is a bit weak on quality, as it tilts to the side, but no loss of functionality)."
"May 8, 2015",Jules,5.0,One,Bought this to replace an older model that gave out after 10 years of use and have used it for over a month.  I love this coffee pot for the lack of carafe and the slim profile on my counter.  Condensation on the lid DOES drip when you open the top but that is a small inconvenience and I would probably spill that much when pouring water in no matter what system I used!  I have no problems filling any cup or travel mug that we have used.  We've tried all the settings and have no issues to report.  Coffee isn't extremely hot right after brewing but it heats up more with the keep warm feature.  Love this coffee pot and will continue to buy Brewstations as long as they make them!
"April 8, 2016",Kristie K.,5.0,,Don't hesitate!  What mess?  People are crazy that say it is a big mess.  This replaced our third dead Keurig and is way better!  Love that you can dispense as little or much coffee as you want.  Filling it?  Way easier and less mess than the Keurig and as people said the baskets come out so I don't know what problem people are having.  We are coffee freaks and we love this!  Makes the best coffee.  Reminds me of Bunn's but way cheaper and no glass to drop and break.  Order! Don't wait!  We use less coffee too because it makes such a good cup.
"April 14, 2016",Stephen F. Sharkins III,4.0,One,Good. A bit clumsy pouring the water in. It is tall so consider your cabinets above. I have to pull the unit out from under the cabinets every morning to open the lid and pour the water; then I push it back. Just occasional burnt taste after hours of warming and if the coffee level is low. The coffee is kept warm by a metal plate about half the size of a business card.
"January 7, 2020",Darla Roth,1.0,,This coffee pot has leaked since day one. Contacted the manufacturer and they did send me a replacement part but did not fix the problem. I did have to pay for shipping on the replacement part. I have purchased many of the same model coffee pots over the years and this one is horrible.
"November 12, 2018",BL,2.0,One,After about two months of use it developed a major drip after dispensing each cup of coffee. This is the second one of these that I have bought. First one lasted about a year before developing the same problem. Don't buy.....
"December 7, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Unless you are a single person who drinks a single cup of coffee, save time and skip the Keurig fad.  This Brew Station makes 1 to 12 cups of coffee, and the ""carafe"" then dispenses coffee into your mug, tumbler, or thermos.  No breakable glass pot to pour or clean.  The carafe and filter rinse clean under water and ready for tomorrow's java kickstart."
"May 12, 2016",Ismael,2.0,One,"I liked this coffee maker because it really keeps the coffee warm for longer than the glass carafe and it made a nicer tasting coffee then those regular coffee makers. However, after 6 months of daily use, the lid to the water dispenser broke; then later on the water dispenser would not pump water into the coffee basket. Sometimes it took me 20-30 min to get the coffee going and other times I just gave up and went to work without coffee... Disappointed and frustrating. We finally gave up on it about 3 weeks ago."
"May 8, 2021",Missouri Veterans Outlet,1.0,,"It quits working entirely, I had faith in this product but after THREE failed coffee makers I will not purchase another one of these junk deals"
"April 12, 2016",SingingFlower,5.0,2,"I'd bought this for Valentines day for my sweetie after reading several reviews. We love this coffee maker and would purchase it again. Very easy to use, no dripping or leaking, and it does not steam out the top as some other reviews had noted. Makes excellent coffee, easy to use, and easy to clean, too!"
"January 26, 2021",barbara bryant,1.0,,This is a piece of junk. It leaks all over the counter and there is no way to prevent it from leaking. I had a Hamilton Beach brewmaster for about 10 years and it was great. When it finally died I bought a $15 Black and Decker and used it for 4 years and it’s still working perfectly. I wanted the ease of a brewmaster so I purchased one and it cannot compare to my first one. This will be my last!
"April 28, 2020",Ruby Crowden,1.0,,"I ordered this Brewstation (supposed to be NEW)and waited almost 2 weeks for it to arrive. It was obviously USED and DID NOT WORK! The panel would light up,  and I did as instructed(which is pretty self explanatory anyway) and when I pushed the start button, it would keep beeping and blinking ""pour water"" and the water was in the reservoir.  TOTALLY UNHAPPY!"
"January 4, 2020",Heather,1.0,,"Coffee pot came broken exposing wiring!!! I looked it over when I first recieved it, everything seemed great. Made first batch of coffee, coffee pot worked great but after dumping remaining coffee out the next day I noticed there was 2,  1/2"" holes exposing wiring next to hot plate......still trying to find a number to get ahold of for returns and exchange for a new one! Soo disappointed!!!!"
"August 19, 2018",Shawn McKenna,5.0,,"Love this! It's not your average coffee maker, but I am glad we have it. I like hot coffee so I get it right away and my wife likes it a little cooler, so we don't leave the heater on. If you do leave the heat on it does seem to taste a little burnt after a couple hours, but if you just let it cool down the flavor remains good!"
"May 4, 2010",Anne Perry,5.0,One,"Have had this particular HB Brewstation for over a month now & so far, so good. Had another model that we loved, but it started leaking after 2 yrs. Could NOT find replacement parts for it, so we just decided to replace it with this one.  Really do love the ""carafe-less"" design.  This model is easier to clean & fill than our previous one, & we don't seem to drip as much coffee when dispensing. Also love the programmable feature, the stainless accents, & the bright display, not to mention it looks great on the countertop & makes really good coffee! Just hope this one doesn't start leaking too! The price for this unit was very reasonable & shipping was FREE & very quick! Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase-so far...!"
"May 11, 2021",Pam,5.0,,"Love love this coffee maker. Robust coffee flavor. I’m a coffee snob and this dispenses great flavored coffee. Easy to clean, easy to dump the grounds."
"December 7, 2019",Bob White,2.0,,"After a few months started leaking.  Thought cleaning it helped at first but still leaks. My wife not happy with coffee dripped on the counter.  Also, a one-trick pony.  Kind of hard to make coffee.  Now that Bunn makes a black and stainless unit my wife will allow me to use one."
"December 9, 2019",Brittany,5.0,,This coffee maker is incredibly easy to use. And the push button to serve is so nice and easy. I have no issues and have owned it for several months now.
"February 21, 2016",arsesta,5.0,,"This has changed our lives! I love this product and I am really into the dispensing feature of the coffee maker, no longer needing to wash an easily breakable carafe every day. The coffee tastes great and stays warm for several hours. It goes off at 6 automatically, I drink my cup at 630, and my husband drinks it at 730/8 and it's still fresh. It's a bit pricier than your normal coffee maker ($20 vs $60) but I think it's a good investment. It's a bit bulkier than I expected. Don't forget to buy a filter because it doesn't come with one. And you will use your own cup because it doesn't include the travel mug in the pic either."
"February 2, 2019",J. Pieper,5.0,,"Great coffee pot but takes a little adjustment if your used to a regular ""caraf"" style coffee pot. Really enjoy the way the coffee is dispensed. Once coffee is ready, you hold any variety of cup and press it against the dispense button and coffee fills your cup or your larger thermal containers."
"July 25, 2018",Monica Tantlinger,1.0,,"I love the fact that we can brew iced coffee, I like the size of the pot. BUT the middle lever that you push to release coffee constantly gets stuck. Sometimes continuing to pour coffee onto the counter.  And you can't push the lever unless the actual pot is against the wall because you need the back of the wall so you can apply enough pressure. It's frustrating because getting coffee out should be the easiest part.  I like the idea of this coffee maker but the execution is poor."
"November 5, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,,We loved it when we first received it but not long after we started using it every day it developed a water leak between where the water tank connects to the unit.  Would not recommend anyone else buying one.  Already ordered another one without the separate water tank.
"October 14, 2019",Katt J,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker more than my Keurig! The flavor of the coffee is fresher, and more bold, I can program it to whatever temperature/style coffee I want. It's just fantastic! I paired it with a goldtone mesh filter basket, so we wouldnt have to continuously buy paper filters, and its marvelous!"
"December 27, 2020",kimberly berry,5.0,,Ordered for my brother. He had one but went through a divorce and she got the coffee pot. Lol. But we ordered a new one and it works great.
"April 3, 2020",Keith Gilman,5.0,,"We used to have the older version of the same coffee maker. I’m so glad we bought the new one. The separate water tank is so nice and eased to fill. It does slide on the counter when you try to fill a cup, but thats expected because it doesn’t weigh 50lbs. Aside from that it’s nice.  The newer updated product is a very nice upgrade."
"July 22, 2019",Dixie Browning,5.0,,This is my 3 rd Brewstation and they get better every time. This one is by far the easiest  to fill and clean. It makes great coffee and I think it only takes about 1 minute per cup. (I usually make 6 cups and it takes about 6 minutes)  The best feature is the water tank on the side that you just fill and put in place. No pouring the water into another tank and making a mess. I plan to wear out this Brewstation too!
"May 17, 2021",Bruce P. Anderson,2.0,,"We have had probably 6 of this same model & once they wear out purchase another because we love coffee & this Brew Station.  This most recent purchase makes a constant gurgling sound following brewing.  I know this in not common with this model because we have used this model for years in 2 locations.  Will follow suggested troubleshooting & if this doesn't solve problem, I request at replacement."
"December 17, 2020",Patricia Brooks,1.0,,"I've had this a month and the above stars are only for flavor, etc. I gave an overall rating of one star because, since day one, when trying to fill my cup, it drips behind the button and fills the drip tray to overflowing. No matter how or where I push or how lightly I push. UGH! I'm so disappointed. No, I wouldn't recommend this product."
"December 19, 2018",Optimistic Intentions,5.0,,We love our coffee maker! I love the self serve feature. You don't have to worry about dropping or breaking the pot. Everything that needs to be washed comes apart and reinstalls easily for cleaning. We use Starbucks Pike's Peak coffee and the flavor is on point. Also the brewing time is quick. It also features a keep warm option for up to 4 hours. Shuts off automatically. Great buy!
"August 12, 2012",Moonstar,4.0,8,"I had a previous model of the Hamilton Beach a few years ago, and replaced it with a smaller Hamilton Beach when I was the only one at home drinking coffee.  Recently, a few members of my family moved back in, and I had to get the big one again.  This one is easier to pour water into the the first one I had.  I like the redesign.  It still makes coffee that doesn't taste burned after an hour in the pot.  I like the fact that there is no glass carafe to break, and it dispenses right into my mug. Another nice thing to note is that, since you dispense right into your cup, you don't have to wait until the whole pot is brewed to get a cup of coffee.  If you are in a hurry, just put your cup under the spout while it is brewing and press the lever.  The coffee that is already made will fill your cup. A word of caution about Hamilton Beach coffee makers-  YOU MUST clean the coffee maker at least every month.  I use white vinegar and run it through at least 3 times.  Our coffee maker is used several times a day, so we have to clean it more frequently than most.  If you do not do this, the coffee maker will start leaving un-heated water in the water holding tank, sometimes 2-4 cups out of the 12 cup capacity.  This makes the coffee you made stronger than it should be and obviously you get less of it.  I don't know what mechanism inside causes this, but if you clean it and run the vinegar through 2 or 3 times, it clears it up and you get back to full pots of coffee that taste great again.  I use about 6 cups of the vinegar and 6 cups of water, and run that same solution through 3 times.  I use the same solution, careful to pour in only the liquid, and leave any solids that were filtered out last run behind. If you do take care to clean it as I suggested, the coffee tastes great, the coffee stays warm for up to 4 hours (you can set it to keep hot for 1-4 hours), and there is no carafe to clean up or break. You can also set it to start brewing at a later time.  I would recommend this coffee maker.  It makes great coffee for a coffee maker in this price range."
"April 14, 2021",B. Smith,2.0,,This is the third time I have bought this model over a period of years. This one began to leak after I had had it only a month. It functions fine just a slow leak that has to be mapped up every day. I will not buy it again.
"February 4, 2021",Kathryn,1.0,,We had the prior version of this coffee maker and over time it started leaking so we ordered the new version.  Sad to say our countertop has coffee all over it and everytime we dispense the coffee it's pouring out of two places - very disappointed as we just got this a few days ago.  I will be emailing Hamilton Beach as well...just a big waste of money but we loved the idea of no carafe.
"March 25, 2015",Pixie,5.0,,After my carafe broke on my Cuisinart and the machine wasn't working like before I did some research on the best coffeemaker. This one was highly recommended on different sites and received great reviews so I decided to try it. I'm so glad I did! Its so easy to use and the clean up is just as easy. My only con is I wish it were a little heavier so it didn't move when I press my cup to get coffee but I just leave it pushed up against the wall so its not really a problem. Has a great 4 hr warmer that doesn't cook your coffee and you can even add on more time to keep your coffee nice and hot.
"October 31, 2020",Jennifer L.,1.0,,We loved this coffee maker until less that five months of use it has begun to leak all over the counters. Cleaned thoroughly and inspected but cant find the source.  Dont waste you money.
"September 16, 2019",Evan D.,4.0,,"Love the dispense mechanism, much more versatile than a regular pot (at the cost of being a pretty large unit). Being made of primarily plastic, there is an odd taste that has yet to dispel; it isn't terrible and I'm sure it will go away after a while, it certainly doesn't ruin the coffee. Everything comes apart for easy cleaning and reassembley."
"January 31, 2012",Shy,5.0,One,"Overall this machine is great. This machine is easy to use with little complication. Other machines like this seem to leave very little space for pouring the water in, this one has more then enough space for pouring as well as a pour spout on the coffee holder for doing just that without a mess. Also other machines have a design flaw when it comes to the size of cups you can use with the machine. I have yet to have such problem. I have used cups of all sizes including a travel mug and a large coffee mug. Also wanted to mention I have not yet had ANY mess on my counter top which I love since regular machines with a coffee pot, over flow all the time as well as create messes when pouring coffee. However the instructions do say to tilt the cup a little while despencing with doing so I have not yet had one spill or one complaint. This is an issue I noticed alot in reviews as well as in other products like this I have used although I have not personally had a problem with this one. This is deffinitely the way to go if you are looking to try out this type of coffee maker for the first time, especially since it is also priced well."
"March 9, 2020",roger disotell,1.0,One,"Coffee leaks out of fill spout, down the face of the coffee maker when dispencing, This is after every brew."
"September 9, 2020",JD,1.0,,"In the past 5 plus years I have had this style of coffee maker twice. The first on no problems therefore when I replaced it no brainer I bought the same model. Big mistake from the get go the unit leaks and I have to clean out the catch tray after ever use. I no longer have my old one or the box from this unit therefore I am stuck with it and now i have to look for another replacement, however I will be looking somewhere else for it."
"April 21, 2016",J_E_M,4.0,,"This coffee maker is pretty good and does most of what is advertised.  It brews moderate strength coffee on the bold cycle, which is good enough for most. The big issue I had with this coffee maker is that it constantly was boiling the water and making a good bit of noise.  I sent the first machine back to Amazon thinking it was a fluke but the second machine had the same problem.  I was able to ""fix"" it by inserting a few layers of aluminum foil to act as a buffer from the heating block.  Coffee still stays hot but it prevents it from giving the coffee a burnt taste or boiling."
"September 13, 2019",LAP,5.0,,"Water reservoir removes easily. Adjustment for 1-4 cups is perfect for times my spouse is away on business trips. Glad unit has the ""Bold"" option. We like our coffee prepared strong like that coffee is served in GE & other European countries. The unit looks elegant on the kitchen counter. The design matches other small appliances."
"May 13, 2019",Sheresa Snyder,5.0,One,This is by far the best one I have tried from Hamilton Beach.  Overall a great coffee maker.  They did there homework on this one.
"November 10, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"The  water reservoir does not hold enough water for 4 decent size mugs of coffee. Also the machine makes a loud noise just keeping warm after brewing. I did not return this coffee maker, and I'm still using it. But will be moving it to my RV and buying a better one for my house."
"July 30, 2016",Carol Hightower,5.0,,"We replaced our old Brew Station when it gave up after many years, and we couldn't be happier.  This machine is a big improvement - and we didn't think improvement was possible.  It's slimmer and more attractive, the level of the coffee is much easier to read, the clock is easier to read, it's easier to fill and set the timer, and the coffee is just as good.  So there's a little condensation running down when you lift the lid - all in all, it's not even worth commenting on because there's so little of it. This coffee maker wins five stars and then some!"
"November 23, 2018",Fww,2.0,,"Got this in Augustand make two small pots of coffee a day.  It has stopped making hot coffee, only warm.  Checked the settings, etc,that is not where the problem is. The window for support closed last week, so I guess I'm out of luck!  My new Mr.Coffee is on it's way!"
"March 11, 2019",Reel Rudy,5.0,,"This is our second coffee maker that we have bought, and we can't enough good things about it.  No carafe to break and replace and keeps coffee at the correct temp for a long time.  No burnt coffee taste.  When this one goes out we'll buy another on just like it."
"January 27, 2021",Kasey,5.0,,"This coffee maker was not a disappointment. I have wanted one for years and finally decided to treat myself. Simple to use, easy to clean, and makes a great tasting cup of coffee. I highly recommend this machine to anyone who prefers their coffee from home, over a drive thru."
"July 13, 2019",The W,5.0,,"This one I bought as a gift, I love these, they usually only last 2-3 years before something snaps off but I think it is still worth it."
"May 20, 2020",alexa,1.0,,"if i could give this stupid product a 0 star rating, i would. this thing leaks everywhere and there’s no way to avoid it because it’s built like a tower. So you open the top lid and gross water goes everywhere. Also, whenever you push the nozzle to pour the coffee, it comes out the sides of the actual nozzle. PLUS idk what this is about but water just pours from a hole in the back. this is the biggest waste of money, don’t purchase this trash."
"April 29, 2019",D Johnson,2.0,,"I replaced the same brand coffee dispenser with this one ( had the other 6 plus years).  The other one I had, the water had to be poured in the back, loved the thought of filling the water dispenser with water and attaching to the side.  BUT the dispenser sits on crooked, leans to the right with a big gap and flush on the bottom."
"May 7, 2019",JStearns,5.0,,This was purchased for my office and we go through around 3 pots a day of coffee with everyone that works here. This machine is holding up great. It is easy to keep clean and we no longer have the mess from people spilling coffee over the counter when pouring it from the glass carafe. We love the programmable keep warm feature. Now if I can just get people who take the last of the coffee to turn the machine off we will be all set!
"May 26, 2021",Kristen D'Acquisto,1.0,,"We had this for just over a year, and it broke. The coffee brews just fine, but the dispenser no longer works to pour the coffee. Pretty disappointing for such a basic product."
"December 17, 2019",Onara,3.0,,Purchased but returning *too light to allow the on demand feature to be used without moving the entire machine. *The water container doesn't sit straight on the machine so it looks crooked. *You have to lift the coffee filter out to retrieve the coffee tank-so using both hands is not convenient. Should have went with the first choice-the Cuisanart DCC3000-the one before this HB.
"June 29, 2016",J. Merz,5.0,,This makes good coffee. It's easy to fill and clean and I love being able to get a full cup of coffee in a big mug. People say it drips. So put a paper towel under it when carrying it to the sink. All coffee makers have condescension when hot water is heated. Not a big deal. It sits on a counter that isn't going to be hurt with a little water. Getting the size coffee I want is worth a little water on my counter. I would buy this again and would recommend it.
"July 28, 2019",Pamela S.,5.0,,This is the third unit we have purchased over several years time. We've been very pleased with the unit. Wife likes it because it is small and we have limited counter space. Wife likes to renew the coffee maker every 2 -3 years just because. Customer service was very helpful the (1) time we used it. Replace unit for us when ours failed after 2 years of service. Very good company and service.
"March 8, 2021",Landon,5.0,,Had the older Version so I knew what I wanted.  Perfect and the best option was variable warmer setting.  Very nice all the way around.
"October 24, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,"Love this coffee pot! I had an older model years back and enjoyed it.. and when my Keurig died I didnt want to replace it and chose this model instead. So glad I did! The ability alone to make iced coffee makes it worth it for me. Easy to use, programmable so I can set it up rock have hot coffee waiting for me when I wake up. Love it!"
"March 21, 2013",PunkyBookster,2.0,,"I bought this to replace my husband's old coffee maker and it did not work out. We liked the look, the style everything about it visually, but once he brewed the coffee and attempted to have a cup he was turned off. The coffee tasted like plastic and no matter how many times you washed this item out it did not change the taste of the coffee. I think maybe a chemical used in making this hung around. And for us that was a little scary to think what one could be consuming. Amazon was great in taking this back and giving a refund. It would be nice if they fixed the issue because this is a great coffee pot otherwise."
"March 5, 2021",Nel Smidt,1.0,,"I bought this for my personal use.  Unfortunately, I threw the box away before using the machine.  This is the worst design I have ever seen.  You must lift out the basket as normal, but then you must lift out the middle cumbersome section in order to put the water in the bottom section.  Would never use on a daily basis.  It is awful. I have returned to my  previous coffeemaker."
"November 25, 2016",greg schmitz,3.0,One,"I like the design and how the machine dispenses.  Clean up requires more effort as both the internal carafe and basket must be rinsed.  Coming from a stainless steel and glass coffee maker, I do notice a taste difference.  The first cup I brewed tasted like plastic.  True coffee snobs should stick with a French press."
"June 6, 2020",Lynn Patterson,5.0,,I have been using this coffee maker for years. I love the way it keeps the coffee hot for hours and it doesn't taste burnt. It is so easy to use and clean. You can't go wrong with this product.
"April 21, 2021",Leslie Young,5.0,,Had this same pot several years ago and loved it and was so so happy to see Amazon still carried it. I drink tons of coffee and this pot is the best!!!
"September 21, 2018",Liam,1.0,,"I've bought 1 Hamilton Beach 12 cup Model 47950 on April 10, 2018, I returned it. I had it replaced with another Hamilton Beach 12 cup Model 47900 on April 13, 2019, it also now leaks as of Sept. 21, 2018. I want to return that also, but do not have the box it came in, didn't think I would need it. - Save your money - I can't give them 1 star, it leaks ! This program made me pick a rating.......No Stars from me."
"October 15, 2013",Rescued ByThe Lamb,5.0,,This is my second Hamilton Beach Brewstation the first one lasted approximately 7 years and I loved it so much I bought another one.  This new one is slightly different but basically the same.  It's so easy to use and there's no breakable carafe you have to deal with.  You can use any size cup or mug you want.  It keeps your coffee hot up to 4 hours and it has different brew strengths for the coffee.  It's also programable so you can get it set up the night before for your fresh coffee when you get up in the morning.  For me ... it's a delight to have in my kitchen.
"May 20, 2016",BimmerGuy,4.0,One,Works great.  We had a Cuisinart model that was similar to this. This coffee maker is sooooo much easier to clean.  I was constantly fighting baked on coffee flakes in the Cuisinart.  I haven't seen a single flake and there's no where for them to hide in this HB model.  It is kind of loud though.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the annoying sound it constantly makes while heating the coffee (for up to 4 hours).  Sounds like it's constantly brewing.
"June 26, 2015",Indy,1.0,4,Bought this coffee maker to replace an old brew station that had seen it's better days. I like being able to fill travel mugs without tilting the cup. Works well. My only real gripe is that it should have a small light to see when filling taller cups.  Update: after only four months of use this unit failed. It now makes a luke warm pot of coffee that has to be microwaved  at first cup. I loved my old brew station which lasted for years. I will get a different brand this time.
"May 7, 2014",R. Dunaway,3.0,,"I bought this as a replacement to my old Hamilton Beach carafeless coffee pot, which I had for years.  They've redesigned it a lot.  A big positive includes a in main reservoir gauge, so you can see just how much you're putting in.  This is a real help when you decide you want more coffee than what you set it up for the night before.  However, the thing drips water everywhere after using.  Open the lid?  Condensate runs down the back of the coffee maker.  Take the filter basket out?  Condensate drips off the long lip at the front.  I definitely miss my old one.  This one does its job, it's just a little messy about it."
"July 9, 2019",Stephanie,5.0,,"This is the 4th one we have bought.  Bought two for our work place and everyone loved it since they kept dropping the glass carafe, breaking it and having to replace it.  I kept my old one as a back-up and we take it on trips, I do not like the coffee pots in most hotels.  We have never had any problems with the one's we have gotten. It is easy to clean.  I even gave away the two coffee pots I bought in Europe since getting this one."
"November 5, 2019",Celinda McManamon,3.0,,"We had this coffee brew station for 6 years before having to replace.  The new one leaks when pushing the dispenser bar. I usually get the insurance as it is so cheap, but loved our last one so didn't think I needed to buy. However, is easy to clean, it offers brew strength, how long you want it to stay on. Would I buy again? Yes - but would get the insurance."
"August 10, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Lasted 4 months and it already quit working. This is the second one. The first one arrived damaged and this one lasted four months and now it only brews half a pot of coffee and leaves the rest of the water in it even after cleaning it thoroughly. I would not recommend.
"April 15, 2018",C.C.,4.0,,"Had two of the older ones and then they started leaking. Put up with that for quite awhile but finally got tired of cleaning it up! Read all their reviews on the new ones and was still concerned about the reviews that said they still leaked. Well, I bought it anyway and so far so good!  I don't think they are made to last anymore than a few years. But that's okay because it's cheap."
"February 25, 2014",kdj721,3.0,,"I am not going to write a novel to review this coffee maker,  just a quick breakdown: What I like: brews quickly, few parts to remove, digital functions, no carafe, looks sleek and attractive on my counter, brews a good tasting pot of coffee, doesn't drip all over the place when pouring a cup despite what many other reviewers stated, perhaps HB fixed this design flaw? What I don't like: a bit light so keep it up against the countertop's back splash so it won't move, temperature of coffee after being dispensed into a mug is not as hot as my keurig, luckily i only use a little cream or else this machine would definitely be sent back. If you drink your coffee with a generous amount of cream then I would not recommend this unless you like lukewarm coffee. overall, a good machine for the price, but I have not yet decided if the temperature is a deal breaker for me since I've only used it once."
"October 31, 2018",Lj,5.0,,"I bought this after reading all the reviews. My $200 coffee maker broke after two years and needed to be replaced. With that being said, I didn’t want to spend a fortune and have the same thing happened with a new one. This was budget friendly and makes a great up of coffee!!! I like that it stays hot for 4 hours, not warm but hot!!! This coffee make is awesome."
"July 8, 2020",Matt,1.0,,"This coffee maker leaks out of the box. First one I thought “no big deal, I’ll return and buy another” Second one also leaks. It leaks from the button and where the coffee comes out, it runs down the side of the coffee maker and the mug you’re filling. My grandma has same model (from many years ago) and hers doesn’t leak!"
"September 21, 2016",MacArthur,4.0,,"Some people have posted it before, but this sucker has a leaking problem. It's actually unfair to call it a ""leaking"" problem because it's not, however, condensation builds at the top of the unit. When you open the lid up, you will have a water problem. I keep a towel underneath it to soak up the water. It's an issue with the design more than function. If you can live with that, it's a great coffee maker."
"December 21, 2020",mutsay,4.0,,"My wife and I bought one of these about a year and a half ago. Love it so, I bought one for my sister and one for my daughter. My sister loves hers, my daughter will get hers for Christmas.....Chuck M."
"December 29, 2019",Keepitreal,5.0,,So easy to use and makes a solid ‘pot’ of coffee. I drink my coffee black and prefer dark roast. Use it every day. This has been a staple for a few years now. No troubles.
"July 26, 2020",Trevor Hueftle,1.0,,Lasted a year before making noises and stopped working. The back of the unit was very hot.  Never had this happen with other coffee makers.
"March 11, 2021",Emily Zoller,1.0,One,"This product leaks coffee all over when you go to fill up your cup. Unless you have the precise amount of pressure on the dispenser, you are just pouring coffee onto your counter. Would not recommend."
"September 14, 2020",Lance Ralls,1.0,,"I like this machine, but the dispenser just stopped working 6 months in.  It is cheap plastic that will break.  I can see the gray button should push in the white lever underneath and that is not working.  I believe it might be the spring issue as well.  Don't buy this as it will break on you."
"April 28, 2017",EJIII.,5.0,,"The removeable water tank sold me on this machine. Got very tired of the awkward pouring operation on our old, similar coffeemaker. The only drawback for me is that the drip tray does not attach to the main unit. I used to be able to pivot my cup on the old machine to dispense coffee without pushing the whole thing back on the counter. Looks like I'll have to glue it or screw it in place."
"November 8, 2013",Amanda D. Davis,5.0,One,"We LOVE this coffee maker!  We have gone through so many coffee makers it is ridiculous, until we found this great machine that has solved all of our previous problems.  We hated that our coffee always got cold with any type of carafe style machine, we even had a thermal one for awhile and even that got cold too fast.  Plus, no matter what carafe we had, or how slow we poured, it always made a huge mess, spilling coffee everywhere.  This machine is AWESOME.  Keeps the coffee nice and hot all the time, and no messy carafe at all.  Love it!"
"January 15, 2020",Brigid H,3.0,,Had it for 3 years. Enjoyed it for a time but now it’s very slow to dispense coffee and it leaks when you dispense. Would not purchase again.
"January 25, 2021",Linda G,5.0,,"It is so nice not to have to fuss with a carafe.  Got one of these years ago as a housewarming and when it finally died, got another one.  Love it."
"February 12, 2020",Dr. W,5.0,,Good product.  Easy to use and clean.  Makes great coffee.  Use same grounds to make additional coffee.  Just add water restart.
"February 5, 2021",Eliseo Alvarez,1.0,,"The first one leaked replaced it. The second one also leaked. Hamilton Beach, please get this appliance working or get it off the market."
"June 29, 2020",Rebecca Myers,5.0,,"Bought original one in 2016 and worked great until the end of 2019, then the dispenser lever quit. Looked for something similar and just ended up reordering the same model. We love it. I'm okay with a three year life span, as they are economical enough."
"March 4, 2020",Ranch Wife,5.0,One,I love this Coffee Maker.  It is much easier to make coffee without the carafe and it is easy to clean.  I have owned 3 of these machines and will continue to use it everyday!!
"January 28, 2019",T Grill,5.0,,"Love my Hamilton Beach Brew station. I should have purchased one years ago. Easy to use, easy to clean and truly keeps coffee hot for 4 hours without burning it. I set it to brew at 6 for my son and when I get up at 7, it taste fresh. Last cup around 9:30 and still the same great taste I has 2 hours earlier."
"July 11, 2019",jewelz Targos,5.0,One,i bought this for my girlfriend who a coffee lover ice coffee this best things about this she’s obsessed wit it ive bought many coffee machines non compare to this easy to clean easy to use n THE PRICE !!!! i would recommend this to anyone who’s a coffee lover !!!
"July 29, 2015",Solds,3.0,,"If you go into the purchase expecting to replace it every few years, you'll be a more satisfied person. This will eventually leak. This is the 3rd one I've purchased in 8 years. I looked at trying something different this time around, but didn't find anything I would prefer more. For the price, I'm okay replacing my coffee pot every so often. When it's not leaking it's great. Pros: Able to pour before entire pot is finished brewing, timer, keeps coffee hot for hours, tall enough to fill travel mug, uses regular filters Cons: Eventually begins to leak"
"October 2, 2020",Rachel Shane,1.0,,"Sadness. I have previously loved my Hamilton Beach coffee makers, and they have lasted me several years each. I purchased this model in May, and have kept in clean and maintained. I keep getting an error message to add more water, when there is plenty of water inside. Will be contacting the manufacturer to see how they are going to make this right."
"April 10, 2014",Jeanette,5.0,One,"This coffee maker makes excellent coffee! You can personalize how you use it to your taste and lifestyle with the timer and brew strength. I love that I can just put my mug underneath to get a fresh hot cup of coffee. It doesn't ""cook"" the coffee to a nasty taste the way traditional burner-style warmers do. Update: We have gotten a lot of daily use out if this coffee maker. It is just starting to get worn out. Sometimes, coffee leaks out the bottom when dispensing. It still makes good coffee."
"March 14, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Coffe maker stopped working a couple months after using it. It started leaking coffee all over the place. I'm attempting now to get a replacement with the 1 yr warranty that’ll cost me another $11 to have shipped to me!
"November 15, 2020",Tommy hall,2.0,,"This is a good coffee pot but, started leaking each time you get a cup of coffee after about a week of use the last coffee maker I had like this one lasted about 10 years no  problems at all which is why I purchased another one just like it I guess things change. I wouldn't purchase another pot like this for $50.00 and get one week use out of it. then need to go to store and pick up a Mr. coffee maker for $19.00 that doesn't leak"
"July 21, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Actually really like this coffee maker! My husband and I wake at different times and the coffee is now still hot for me- 2 hours after it was first brewed. I really like how I can dispense what I need and don’t ever have to clean a glass carafe.
"December 14, 2020",Mary Houston,1.0,,"We like the Hamilton Beach feature of no caraffe, but eventually all of their machines leak.  This one leaked from day 1!  When you pressed on the back with the coffee mug, coffee ran down the machine and all over the counter.  It's a piece of garbage.  Returned it."
"February 13, 2020",Angelady,5.0,,"So convenient, no glass caraffe to drip or spill, gently press my cup to fill to my desired amount and no mess, stays hot. convenient,clean, nice looking on my counter matches my appliances."
"July 31, 2016",Kaye,5.0,6,"I have had this particular model...#48465...for about a month now but I have been using the Hamilton Beach Brew Station for over 10 years. (It seems like the first one we had was called a Brew Master but it has been so long ago I can't be sure.) This is my third one. I absolutely love it and I will never go back to the drip coffee makers again. I had my first one for about 8 or 9 years before it needed to be replaced. We couldn't find one like it in the store so we went back to a drip coffee maker for about 3 days before I went back out trying to track down a Brew Station. I finally found one and this model has replaced that one. After two years, I thought the second one had gone bad but our water has a lot of mineral content and once I read the manual and cleaned it properly with white vinegar...twice...it is working like a champ again. I had already ordered this one from Amazon so we decided to keep them both and use the old one for a back up. I read a lot of reviews about the reservoir leaking but I have had no problems with that at all. I did realize though that if you overfill the reservoir that water will come out of the air hole on the back of the coffee maker and puddle underneath. The thing I love the most is that my coffee never has that burnt taste that you get with drip coffee makers."
"November 14, 2019",Daren,3.0,,It leaks water all over the right side after it gets done brewing and is very noisy after brewing when the warming burner is on.
"September 1, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,The coffee is better using the bold setting.  Having to disassemble the layers of the coffee maker is inconvenient.  Better to get it with a side water storage.  The temp of the coffee could have been hotter.
"October 26, 2015",Cassie,5.0,,"This is the best coffeemaker I have ever owned.  I love that there is no carafe to worry about breaking, and you can fill your cup with just one hand.  Other reviews indicated that coffee isn't hot enough.  I have never had that problem.  Brews fairly quickly, and you can begin pouring at any time.  No need to wait until the carafe is full.  This uses standard paper basket filters.  Very easy to operate.  I like the options for how long you can keep coffee warm.  The max is 4 hours, that's usually the setting I use, and coffee never tastes burnt."
"October 29, 2018",Crabbycat,5.0,,"I love my Keurig, but wanted a regular coffee maker so I could have some coffee always ready. This maker works well and keeps the coffee at the right temp for up to 4 hours. I would recommend it"
"August 17, 2018",Nick,1.0,,"We loved this item.... until it leaked all over our counter and floor. We received this in March and item is faulty after 4 months of use? Not good at all. I do not recommend this item for the above reason. HamiltonBeach, whats going on? We have used similar brewers over the past 10 years and this one is total garbage compared to your previous models."
"August 23, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I really liked this coffee maker, you could program it and there is also an option to keep it on the ""warm"" setting for 2 or 4 hours.  I am not a daily coffee drinker. About 6 months ago I noticed there would be about 2 cups of water left in the water chamber after it finished brewing, no big deal.  Then last week it was leaving 6 cups water in the chamber and only brewed 6 cups."
"February 21, 2017",ClolC,4.0,One,"Makes great coffee and the detachable reservoir (water tank) for easy fill and cleaning was well worth the purchase. I only had one issue and that is concerning the reservoir cap hinges which consist of 2 flimsy plastic bumps/nodes that are very fragile. In fact, one broke off while I was re -attaching lid after cleaning parts on day one of purchase. So far product works as advertise and I am satisfied overall with the units performance. Will see re-evaluate in 6 months."
"April 7, 2014",Carol,4.0,,"This coffee maker has good features.  Love having the separate water resevior and different brewing options. Also does iced coffee though I don't use this feature.  Has a setting for brewing smaller number of cups and for bolder brew.  Can be set to leave on for 1-4 hours.  However, even though there is no pot sitting on a burner, there is still a heating element so more than 3 hours is still pushing the limit of good taste.  I like not having a glass pot (that's why I had to replace my last coffee maker), and the single cup dispenser.  Easy to clean, the basket lifts right out(but be sure to let it cool down first)."
"December 22, 2019",Nathan h. Parker,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. It is so easy to fill the water tank and the coffee. You can literally do it one handed. Keeps coffee very hot and also has a feature to reheat leftover coffee. Great machine.
"March 2, 2016",Coastal Cook,5.0,,Extremely happy with this coffeemaker.  It brews a delicious pot of coffee whether you set it for 12 cups or just 1 to 4.  The coffee stays hot and doesn't get bitter as with a glass carafe on a warming plate.  We've had 2 Bunn coffee makers in the past which were over $100.00 each and both broke within 2 years.  We loved the coffee but found it disappointing they broke so soon.  This Hamilton Beach replaces a Keurig Elite which is in the attic because we didn't like the coffee at all in spite of trying different brands.
"January 8, 2018",Josephh49,1.0,4,"I have been a Brewmaster user for many years. i rarely write reviews, but up until now I would have given the Brewmaster 5 stars.It has been my experience that they have lasted us, on average, 2.5-4 years of several pots of coffee per day. My last one lasted a little less than 2 years, but I just attributed that to luck of the draw - some last longer, some shorter. However, I put this unit into service on 17 Aug 2017, and on 7 Jan 2018 it stopped working. I came downstairs in the morning to a ""Fill water"" message. I thought perhaps I had forgotten to press the timer button, so I pressed the power button to start brewing. After about a minute, it shut itself off and gave the ""fill reservoir"" message again. Emptied it, refilled it, nothing. Tried putting vinegar through it (I clean it regularly, last time about 3 weeks ago). Nothing worked. Went online, found several accounts of people having the same problem. The problem was attributed to a faulty sensor. Several fixes suggested, none worked for me. I've e-mailed the company, but I am not optomistic - they have a one year guarantee, but if they honor it i have to pay shipping both ways - which is about the cost of a new one. I would appreciate any feedback from anyone who may have had a similar problem. I'm still a Brewmaster fan, but beginning to wonder about quality control. Thanks."
"April 11, 2016",Leon N,5.0,One,Great coffeemaker. Just as advertised. I have had no issues. It takes a bit getting used to loading the water in the right compartment Lol.. I had no problem dispensing  on large mugs. A bit hard to see water level inside and cups measurement seems in the small side... like 6 oz? A full 12 cup reservoirs barely fills 4 of my 16-oz coffee mugs. No big deal. I am very happy
"April 28, 2016",Mr & Mrs Wright,5.0,,"Coming back to drip coffee makers after 2 years with an electric peculator... which everyone else was terrified of using. Went HB because I loved the old model 47224 which I loved to pieces, literally! The carafe/pot disintegrated and the valve fell out. So far this one is being used regularly, it does make a fair bit of noise when it's in warming mode, little hissing noises with bubbles sound (like a kettle that just near boil but not quite). Eventually you tune it out... the old one was super quite which I do miss."
"May 19, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Very easy to setup and use. I have it set for keep warm for 4 hours and it stays warm for another 2 hrs. Filling the reservoir is easy and clean up is a breeze.
"June 21, 2020",Bucks,1.0,,Upon making coffee for the first time we noticed as the coffee dispensed into the cup some of the coffee would trail down the coffee maker as you had the mechanism pushed in.  We proceeded to contact Hamilton Beach to notify them of the issue and they sent a replacement water measure container thinking that would fix it.  It's still doing it as of this morning.  There is a design flaw in this maker.  The coffee should only go into your cup.
"October 20, 2018",Margie Weiand,5.0,,After more than 10yrs my old coffee maker (exact same model) died. I was ecstatic to find the same model! Best coffee maker ever! I drink alot k coffee and the convenience of not washing a decanter is the best! I will get another Hamilton Beach when this one dies. Keep up the good work Hamilton Beach!
"October 29, 2019",Katie Petty,1.0,,Had this for two months at first we absolutely loved the convince of filling a cup of coffee. But sadly after two months it completely stopped working. Completely disappointed that it only worked for 2 months!  The light comes on saying fill water even though water is already filled it continually beeps and shuts itself off 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️. So we can’t even clean it to see if that helps. We had to go out and buy something else.
"September 17, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I have had this brand of coffee maker for years and just purchased this maker to replace the previous one. The coffee is very hot and the best benefit is not having to clean the carafe. You can program the strength and time you want the coffee to be held hot. Great machine!!
"February 7, 2020",Hard 2 impress,5.0,,"This is my third coffee maker from the same manufacturer. I have one in my apt, one in my RV, and now one at home. This work awesome, is the best coffee maker. Easy to everything, clean, prepare, and everything in between"
"December 17, 2016",smokinjj,5.0,One,"This is a big improvement on the old ""Coffee Station"".  Because of the outside water dispenser it is much easier to clean and easier to keep clean.  There is no buildup on the top lid and no splash back when putting in the water.  It was impossible to cleanly pour the water into the old model but the outside water attachment makes life very easy.  No more puddles on the top of the counter."
"June 13, 2016",Kong,5.0,,"Wow, a coffee maker is a coffee maker....RIGHT? Well, that's basically what I thought,  till we bought this. Makes quick, hot, and I do mean HOT COFFEE. No disappointments here! Had a lot of different coffee makers, and this is by far the best we have ever used. I  forgot to mention; it makes the BEST BREWED AND TASTIEST COFFEE too. Me, excited over a coffee maker. YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE IT !!!"
"August 1, 2019",Lesa Kay Palerino,2.0,,I have purchased 3 Hamilton beach coffee makers in the less three years because the washers wear out at the  dispensing site and coffee drips continuously which has permanently stained my counter tops.
"August 5, 2019",Candice B.,5.0,,I had a similar model that I had to replace due to my error using it. Anyway I’m glad I did. The separate water container is soooo much better than filling the “carafe” section and then pouring into the machine. No more spilling water on the counter. Programmable feature works great! So far so good.
"December 30, 2019",N. Lagana,5.0,,This is our favorite coffee pot.  Have had several. Very convenient as no carafe to break. Easy to clean and makes great coffee!
"October 21, 2018",JENNIFER T.,4.0,,"I really like the options offered by this Hamilton Beach coffee pot.  It keeps the coffee hot for 4 hours which was a pain with a normal glass carafe. However, the strength option did not work but I decided to keep it anyway since my husband said the strength was fine with him. So far a good coffee pot for a fair price."
"February 23, 2015",grdjones,5.0,,"I got to tell you this was at my house before I hit the buy button.  Ok maybe not that fast, but it got there in less than 2 days.  So cudos to Amazon Shipping.  The product is as advertised.  If I had a recommendation, it would be to make it pour out better, I wan to put the coffee in a thermos but it doesn't pour very well.  I tried doing it a cup at at time but that made a huge mess.  We had a 10 cup coffee maker similar to this one before and the bucket that holds the coffee was shaped for pouring.  Still all in all a great product."
"May 23, 2017",jorose1,1.0,7,"Purchased this item from Amazon 3 times because we liked it so much...WHEN IT WORKED!  Bought our first one in Oct 2015 and immediately loved it.  Makes good coffee and is nice to just dispense one cup at a time.  Don't have to mess with cleaning a carafe etc. Replaced it in Jan 2016.  Thought it was just a fluke that it quit working after just 3 months, but decided to replace it since it was not that expensive.  The 2nd one lasted until Feb 2017...a whole 13 months!  Still loved it, so tried one more time and purchased our 3rd. It went in the garbage on May 22nd, 2017 after less than 3 months of use.  Just quit working and kept shutting off before it could complete a cleaning cycle or a brew cycle. (exactly what happened with the 2 previous purchased). I sent an email to Hamilton Beach but haven't received a reply.  Will update this review if they replace it, but I was so angry I threw it in the garbage so no option for repair. Don't intend to buy any more Hamilton Beach products.  Very disappointed because unless you buy a single serve machine with expensive k-cups, there isn't anything out there like this. Guess we'll go back to a coffee maker with a ""dripless"" carafe and drip all over the counter whenever we pour a cup..sigh!"
"October 3, 2017",Zane Evans,5.0,,"These coffee makers are awesome! My last unit, just like this one, lasted me ten years but had gotten increasingly slow on the dispenser.  I could've likely cleaned it with vinegar or something but the flow difference with the new one was fully worth the price of admission. I love how they have not changed the design of this classic brew station."
"March 24, 2017",Kalle Beck,1.0,One,I purchased this product in December 4th of 2016 and by February of 2017 it stopped brewing coffee effectively and would only brew about 2 cups of coffee at a time and the reserve tank would remain partially full. The coffee also started to taste bad. This is unfortunate as I loved it until this point but I cant recommend a product that only lasts this short amount of time. I had a previous Hamilton Beach model coffee maker and it also started to disfunction a similar way within a year of use.
"July 29, 2018",Lynda B.,5.0,One,I love this coffee pot! We love to overfill the coffee filters because we love our coffee strong. This has a built in filter between the coffee strainer and the pot that keeps the ground out of our coffee- even if we put too much in. This maker dispenses coffee that is super hot and also has a timer that will turn the coffee pot off at your designated time of up to 4 hours.
"February 5, 2018",Kimbrell Farms,2.0,,Have only had it barely 6 months and already it leaks all the time and won't make a full 12 cups at one time.  It might make  to four cups and then stops.  Have to turn it off and turn it back on to get it to make another 2 to 4 cups.  I have tried everything.  Will never buy another one.
"April 29, 2019",Bob Reuder,1.0,,"Bought this to use at work. Had a older version that lasted for probably what was 5-6 years. Sorry to say this one didn't make it a year! Used the unit usually once a day 5 days a week. Came back into the office mid-morning with the smell something electrical burning, unplugged the unit immediately. With this life expectancy, and possible fire hazard, I will not buy another."
"February 7, 2020",J. Torres,5.0,,"Love it so much,  I had one sent to my mom! Great price, easy to program, user friendly if you don't want to utilize the digital features, measure your coffee, fill your h20 reservoir and hit the start button! Will keep coffee warm for up to 3 hours without tasting burned down to the last cup. Would/ does recommend to others!"
"January 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,I was very disappointed with this product.After careful and normal use it began leaking water at the seams .. a-lot of water.It was just weeks after the return time expired so i had to just toss it and purchase a different brand.
"December 2, 2013",Richard Taylor,5.0,One,"Excellent coffee maker!  This is my second, as the first one lasted several months and just stopped working.  Amazon replaced it quickly and this one seems to me working just fine.  This replaces an earlier version of a dispensing coffeemaker, and just works better.  The water container removes to take to the faucet, so no pouring into a small, dark corner.  There is a visible level of water, another for coffee remaining, you can set the ""keep-warm"" time, the brew timer works perfectly and is simple to program - there is just nothing not to like here."
"September 8, 2020",V,2.0,,"Mine leaks out of the bottom just enough to make you furious! Ugh... I am so disappointed. It started off, just a little coffee on the counter... now it is a puddle on the counter! terrible.  I am throwing it in the trash because it is past my return date. VERY pissed about it. grrrr."
"November 23, 2018",J Gibbs,2.0,,"Love the ease and convenience of making coffee with this machine.  However, I'm on my 2nd unit.  Both leaked.  1st one leaked from the water reservoir, the new one (that is less than 10 months old) is now leaking out of the dispensing spout.  Very disappointed.  Will not try for number three!"
"February 21, 2020",Christopher L.,1.0,,"The reservoir was broken when the unit arrived, which they replaced at the time taking 2 weeks to deliver it. The carafe leaks constantly and when this was brought up to Hamilton Beach, they expect you to pay $15 for shipping and handling while still under warranty. If it worked and didn't have so many issues this product would be great, but as it stands now DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
"June 12, 2017",Lizzie B.,4.0,,"This is a great coffee maker! Keeps my mom's coffee warm, easily accessible and no messy carafe to deal with. A bit cumbersome to pour water into, hard for my mom's arthritis, but I set it up each night and use the timer option, which is fantastic. 4 stars and not 5 because we had to return the first one due to constant leakage."
"March 8, 2021",C.Kelly,1.0,,The coffee maker was opened after its available to return date.  (Part of a kitchen make-over) The water reservoir and coffee ground basket did not sit right causing the lid to be open during brewing.  NOT HAPPY that the unit was so out of alignment for use.  I think this was probably already a return resold.
"May 13, 2021",Tammie Gist,2.0,,"This was not put together properly. It had a continued leak, but when we tightened some screws to stop the leak, it no longer would keep the coffee hot."
"September 22, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,The self-contained coffee holding area with push button dispenser is awesome!!! Makes great coffee with no spills or grounds overflowing. Keeps great tasting hot coffee for 3 hours. After that it gets a little burnt flavored but is still as hot as when initially brewed.
"September 11, 2019",Jennifer kelly,5.0,,Works great! I like that I can program it and wake up to fresh brewed coffee.. I can also set it to keep warm up to four hours which is great! A little noisy when brewing and a lot of water leaks when you lift up the top lid. Over all happy
"June 3, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is our third Brewmaster and we love the fact that there is no carafe to worry about.  Makes great coffee with several brew intensities and programmable.  Very good product.
"March 10, 2020",some donkus,3.0,,It’s more of a pain to use than a regular coffee maker. When you push your cup into the pour button the whole machine moves and you have to keep in in place with your other hand. Takes a long time to brew mediocre coffee. Looks cool. Technically works. For the same price I’d buy something else.
"June 9, 2018",Anna,3.0,One,Not sure if this plastic is BPA free. If your coffee is going to sit in the heat....not good. I'm estrogen dominant and I have to avoid plastic bottles or containers since they mess up your hormones. I prefer the glass or traditional coffee maker. Great product and great idea but not for me.
"May 5, 2016",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I bought one of these for my daughter who lives out of state.  When I purchased mine and received it, I thought I got a defective one and was going to return it.  I then visited my daughter and found hers was the same way.  Although it is convenient to have the fill tank on the side, it does not sit straight and looks crooked.  My husband thought I burnt the coffee as it does not brew well.  It is also very light weight and you must have it up against a wall so that it doesn't move when you are trying to pour a cup of coffee.  I have the old brew station and thank goodness kept it because now my new one is back in the box."
"April 11, 2021",LA300,1.0,,I love the first one I got a couple of years ago. When it went out I ordered another one. Every time you get a cup of coffee it leaks down the back. I returned it for a replacement thinking there was something wrong with it but the replacement did the same thing. Very disappointed. Really loved my first one.
"December 29, 2020",JJC,4.0,,I had to call for a replacement and received it quickly. Unfortunately yesterday the front of it is now cloudy and I will be notifying them again.
"March 24, 2013",Linda,5.0,,This is a great coffee maker and am so glad I bought it.  I haven't had any problem with it leaking.  The programing is very easy to understand and operate.  It's so nice having the coffee ready when we get up.  It's is extremely quiet when brewing and is very fast.  It doesn't take up as much counter space as I was expecting it to. I like that my husbands large insulated mugs fit under it without having to tip them sideways.  The coffee is hotter than with our old coffee maker and it stays hot until the it shuts off at the time we have programmed.  I recommend this coffee maker to everyone.
"February 16, 2016",RJC,5.0,One,"I am very pleased with this unit, (48464) as I was with the first one we had for several years.  The 47950 we bought locally to replace the older 48464, was a peace of crap that leaked internally, and stopped working in less than a month.  The cost of shipping to use the warranty program is more than the cost of a new unit.  Now the only question is.  Will the new 48464 last as long as the old one did?"
"December 20, 2017",Blanche,5.0,,We love the ability to pour one cup at a time without having to brew single cups!  We always keep a spare in the cupboard just in case they stop making this model.  We hope not!  We use the timer feature so that our coffee is already brewed when we get up in the morning.
"August 27, 2019",Scott S.,1.0,,For the past several months I have been finding some water behind the unit. Sometimes a little and some times more but it seem to be dripping down between the counter top so I never could see just how much water until this morning. I decided to put the tray under it. What sucks is i  can’t find if I payed extra for the warranty or not -  so I guess I am screwed.
"June 13, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"It’s a coffee maker! Used it to make coffee It’s our second one. After about 5 yrs the area you press wears out & the coffee just trickles out. This was to replace our old one. Best coffee maker, to me!"
"December 15, 2015",MomTo2Nics,3.0,3,"I loved this for a while. There's always water around the bottom of the unit.  Every day. Today, one year and 2 days after I bought it, it didn't turn on. I got my old Mr. Coffee machine out, banged it on the counter and the unit turned on. The clock doesn't keep the accurate time.  Gradually gets up to 5 minutes fast.  Reset it often. I love the concept but really disappointed after one year"
"February 4, 2019",Angela,4.0,,This is a great coffee maker! It’s very easy to fill and clean! I love putting my mug up and filling it!! Some reviews say it’s hard to poor but I think just the opposite!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like to push it on again to keep the coffee hot longer then 4 hours but it will not let you with out brewing again.
"August 30, 2013",Themis,5.0,One,"Excellent product at a great price. The U.S. based support from Hamilton Beach was great and the only problem was quickly resolved. I've had HB BrewStaton coffee makers before and they put just about everybody else to shame - particularly all the expensive ""luxury"" types costing $150,  $200, or more. They may have a nicer appearance, but certainly don't make a better cup of coffee. All the essential features and easy to clean too! Suggest getting the gold filter basket and using paper filters which eliminates any grounds disposal issues. You'll be happy with this ""Good Buy!"""
"July 28, 2013",Amy G,5.0,,"This is my second Brewstation. The other one lasted 8 or 9 years and I was happy with it the entire time. It finally died and I replaced it with this newer version. It works just as well! Yes, there is a bit of water that will drip on the counter around the coffee maker - primarily off the lid when you open it to make another pot of coffee. A quick wipe of the coffeemaker and the counter takes care of that. Otherwise, it works perfectly. And I love being able to program the coffeemaker to have a pot of coffee ready to go in the morning!!!"
"February 21, 2016",GadgetFamily,3.0,6,"This Machine, should you choose to Select it, will self destruct 1 -2 weeks after the end of the warranty. This must be for the security of all coffee agents around the world, so we all should all thank Hamilton Beach....I'm sure it has nothing to do with Job security for them or their employees. We have had 3 different generations of these Brew Stations and the verdict has been the same on each one.  We love the concept...the no carafe design is awesome and perfect for our busy family. It is simple to use and easy to clean. We have had our share of broken carafes in the past and one model we had was so expensive to replace the carafe that we decided to just try our first Hamilton Beach Brew station instead. But truly we have a love/hate relationship with them. Each model...all 3 Brew Stations we have owned have performed beautifully and were beloved parts of our household... until their untimely deaths. After this particular model, we went with the next generation Brew Station, fully anticipating a short life and understanding that our investment was one of relatively short term convenience...meaning making daily life easier for 1 yr.  As expected, that machine died soon after the warranty expired too. I think I heard it give off a maniacal laughter first, like at the end of the ""Thriller"" video...but I can't be certain."
"February 23, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I had previously owned the brew station with water tank on the side and loved it! Best feature is the push button dispenser instead of pouring coffee from a pot. Sadly, every day when I move this unit to wipe counters there is a puddle underneath. It is not from overfilling the reservoir or my coffee cup. I purchased this less than 3 months ago and it is disappointing."
"April 23, 2018",Some guy,5.0,,"Awesome coffee maker. Very easy to use. Buttons are straight forward, and it only makes one beep when done, versus a lot of annoying beeps. It's easy to setup and clean as well. The only thing that I don't like is that the blue display is on all the time, so at night it's like a small nightlight. We were hesitant to switch from a carafe-style maker to this one, but we love it."
"February 9, 2020",Ranradio,1.0,,This the third one I have bought over many years. This one lasted 11 months before it quit working. To use the warranty you have to pay shipping BOTH ways on about 8 pounds. So I'm going to buy a another brand this time.
"January 13, 2012",amy78748,5.0,,"I too read the comments before purchasing the HB brewstation and was concerned that i would have water and coffee spilled all over my counters everyday.  but, i have never spilled a drop, nor has my husband.  the lid will get condensation build up, like all coffemakers do- but just tap it and slowly raise the lid up & you should have no problem. I have used ALL different types of cups with it and have never had a problem with spillage.  you may have to angle some cups (like you do on the on door water on your frig), but it's not a problem. My husband leaves a little before me and with this coffeemaker- i too can have hot coffee in the mornings- yah! It's very easy to clean and fill the coffeemake and I didn't even read the instructions before setting it up- so it was pretty easy."
"October 23, 2019",Joe,5.0,,First Coffee maker came and wouldn't brew a full pot but the seller sent a replacement right away and it works great
"December 27, 2019",Luckee138,5.0,,"It does require cleaner, I tried to use vinegar and the instructions for that are weird. It keeps the coffee warm for up to four hours so there is little waste."
"May 18, 2017",jwilli,4.0,One,"This is a great coffee maker, especially if you use the auto timer.  I've had mine about 2 months and love the dispensing feature. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is if your making a pot without using the auto timer, it takes 10 - 11 minutes to brew a full pot.  Maybe I'm spoiled to the 3 minute Bunn and the almost instant Keurrig, but it just seems very slow.  But since I almost always use the auto timer, I love being able to fill my mug first thing in the morning just by pressing it against the dispensing button."
"April 11, 2020",Harley Buckskin,3.0,,"Its easy to use and I like the IDEA of no carafe, but the heating element burns coffee to it once the reservoir has run down below half full. I'm a coffee snob, this won't work for me."
"August 21, 2016",Joshua Longsack,5.0,,"Got this unit from prome for around $35US. We've been enjoying the coffee maker daily for a couple months now.  The coffee stays very hot and doesn't get the burnt taste, even after 7-8 hours of continuous on.  I rather enjoy the push button pour feature. I'd highly recommend this product over a conventional carafe style one. Happy hunting."
"March 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"If you pour it right after the coffee is made it's not as hot, but it quickly heats up if you just wait a little bit longer. I have not had any acidy or bitter taste from my coffee with this maker and it's easy to fill and clean. I am really enjoying my coffee lately with this!"
"November 15, 2018",Lily A,5.0,,I love this machine .. it’s greats .. You can make up to 12 cups . It’s not good for one cup single cup . I still use my keurig for one single cups . You can make single cup on it but it use a lot of coffee . It keep the coffee warm up 4 hours . It tell u the time on it . I only bought for 29.00 after amazon deal .
"January 4, 2019",J. McFarland,1.0,,Have had a brew station before. Lasted several years. We have had this coffee maker for 6 months. It started leaking several weeks ago. We thought just from where the coffee is dispensed. But it is puddling under the coffee maker and making a huge mess. Buyer Beware! What a disappointment!
"June 17, 2020",soccerstar18,1.0,,"Super disappointed with this product and I usually have good experience with Hamilton beach. I bought this coffee maker because I my previous one ( one grade lower model Hamilton beach) started to leak out of the coffee dispenser, granted it lasted about 2 yrs before an issues.  This one, does not leak out constantly, but when you push the button for the coffee to dispense some goes in the cup, the rest goes down the back and into the drip catcher."
"August 7, 2015",Lynn Elwood,1.0,One,"Replacing the original BrewMaster should have been a better experience.  I had used the previous model for almost ten years of daily use.  The new features looked wonderful.  As others have noted, the design for the current model is hopelessly flawed.  Water condensation flows underneath the coffee reservoir and pools near the heating element.  It has reached the point that I have to make coffee in three stages, shutting off the maker and emptying the collected water before continuing the cycle, or my 12 cup coffee maker stops at about 5 cups.  I have reached the point that I am replacing the maker, and hoped that Hamilton Beach would have corrected these flaws.  I loved my previous BrewMaster, and would love to have another carafe-less maker that makes a larger amount of coffee than the currently popular single cup machines.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer has not replaced the model, and other reviewers responses indicate that they are aware of the problem and simply do not care about their customers."
"June 7, 2021",Ouida Carpenter,5.0,,"This is a terrific coffee maker.  I purchased it to use in the camper.  Makes great coffee, easy to clean and use."
"November 22, 2015",waymoo,5.0,One,"Really like the removable water reservoir for easy, spill-free filling! Our counters were usually a mess from spilled/splashed water when filling other models. Love the easy dispenser for hot coffee, and the fact that it does not scorch coffee even when it sits for hours - coffee never tastes ""old"". We do have to use a pinch of baking soda on the metal heat element in the coffee reservoir to get ""baked on coffee"" off if someone does not turn it off as soon as it's emptied."
"May 19, 2018",kathfz,2.0,,Its ok but very bulky.  I got rid of my keurig to save on kcups and reduce footprint on counter but this is very big on my counter and honestly does not need to be so big.  The coffee is ok and is hot but my french press does better.
"January 21, 2020",Linda L.,5.0,,This is our second coffee maker like this. Not having a carafe to clean is the reason we like this so much.  It makes great coffee also.
"June 30, 2020",Paul Anderson,1.0,,"Second try. The first one leaked all over our counter every day. We read all the instructions and all the troubleshooting to no avail. Finally sent it back. This second one worked for about a month. Then started overflowing on our counter every day again. Yes, I know we have to clean it monthly. But the penalty for not doing everything perfect is coffee everywhere! Too much effort for a coffee machine"
"January 3, 2018",Denise H.,5.0,,This is my second Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker.  My first one lasted years.  I like not having a carafe to deal with.  It makes good coffee and keeps it warm and ready a long time without scorching it.  I like this model better than my previous because of the stainless front.  I hoped it would bounce more light into my tall Contigo mug so that I could tell if it was full.  It does.  The lighter material makes it easier to see inside your mug as you fill it.  I like this one better than the bigger model with the side water reservoir.  It's easy to fill the bucket and pour into the coffee maker and takes up a little less counter space.  I hope to enjoy this one as long as I enjoyed my first machine!
"December 20, 2015",S. Greene,1.0,7,"Updated Review: Well, went to make coffee this morning and set it all up and pushed start and nothing happened. I then noticed that the display was off. I checked the surge protector is was plugged into and lights were good. The toaster plugged into the same set up powered on fine. Looked over the owners manual and I didn't see anything about my problem, only thing would be to start something with Hamilton Beach, which I don not want too. Other option is a return/exchange via Amazon and I would rater return/refund so that is what I am doing! Only used if for just under 2 months, so about 40 8 cup brews is all it had on it. Never an issue until sometime between the last brew and this morning it died? Original review: Been using for a month, and it is pretty good. This replaced a standard drip & glass coffee pot maker. Likes: Blue back lit display Beep to confirm start time ability to adjust ""keep warm time"" 0-4hr Dislikes: Hard to fill my large 20oz stainless coffee cup (works well with standard mugs and such up to 16oz) Discarding of used filter & coffee (due to condensation the bottom of the basket accumulates a lot of water so taking it out and to the trash can get water/coffee all over so I have to take the brewed coffee reservoir and basket to the trash to prevent this Over all I like it and will continue to use it"
"June 28, 2018",Jeffrey D. Diamond,3.0,,"Have owned many of the same model for years.  Really like it.  Problem, the last two leak mercilessly and make a mess on the kitchen counter.  Of course, it didn't happen until the return window closed and we're stuck with it.  Not sure we'll replace this one, it may be time to move on to another style coffee maker."
"August 3, 2019",Laurie Kot,1.0,One,The water reservoir leaks where the clear cup measurement piece inserts into the side of the reservoir.  Obviously there's no quality control at Hamilton Beach because you can easily see that the resveroir won't  hold water.
"July 20, 2016",Juicy J,4.0,,Great coffee maker.  Brews a delicious cup of coffee for a fairly cheap coffee maker.  I have read some reviews of people talking about it leaking.  That is the case when you have it completely full of water and move the coffee maker.  The water then moves around and will leak out of the coffee maker. Other than that this is a nice little coffee maker for home without breaking the bank.
"March 9, 2015",Roadzter,5.0,One,"If you need coffee runs every so often, this is the best coffee machine out there. A little complicated to clean since you have more parts to remove in order to rinse but it's worth it if you use it daily. I like the ability to remove the water reservoir. Note that it will leak from the dispenser valve after multiple uses. There are a lot of ""fixes"" but I found that putting a small tea cup or espresso cup at the base when it's brewing and between servings does enough to catch the small drops. Assuming the leak is just mild and not often, this should do it without any added effort. Aside from that, it's a great product."
"June 4, 2017",DJ Montgomery,5.0,,"So far so good -- this will be our third Hamilton Beach brewmaster.  The other two were older versions, and they BOTH leaked horribly.  This one seems to have solved the leak problem with a new design.  FABULOUS coffee from all of them ... love that the liquid doesn't sit for up to 3 hours and COOK.  It just stays warm, which doesn't change the taste or consistency.  Perfection.  This model also allows for filling a travel mug."
"October 29, 2013",Stacy,5.0,11,"This is the perfect coffee maker! It's so easy to use and convenient to top it off.  The reason I bought it was for my in laws,  they have an old coffee maker and constantly forget to turn it off.  With this black brew station,  they just set a time frame for when to shut off and never have to worry again! Not to mention the coffee is never burnt and it makes iced coffee too! Love it love it love it !"
"September 9, 2018",Tom Jacques,5.0,,"This replaced an older but similar model we had that started acting up after about 10 years.  So far this maker has met our expectations.  Brews a great coffee, has a programer heating element timer, is easy to care for and quickly dispenses coffee.  Would recommend."
"December 6, 2020",Joseph G.,4.0,,"Works like it should, does not keep coffee really HOT....this is the only negative....would probably buy again."
"December 16, 2019",Susan Elias,3.0,,It would be much better if there were a light where the coffee comes out.  Hard to see how much Is going on the cup.  It does not help my coffee cups are dark.
"October 1, 2020",Rick Kevin Keener,2.0,,"The coffee maker worked good for a while but then,, the filter in the bottom of the reservoir kept getting plugged ( I only use filtered water ) taking a long time to fill a cup. I have to clean it with a brush every pot and now it leak's coffee all over the counter. I liked it at first but now am going to replace it with a Bunn."
"September 14, 2020",E. Lambert,4.0,,Would’ve given it 5 stars but it’s noisy...when it brews AND after while it’s staying hot. Otherwise I love it!
"December 11, 2019",Venessa Ripy,3.0,,You dont get the flavor of have a Glass coffee carafe. But overall it's a nice Coffee pot. But I have only had it a month and the lights on the clock area are starting to flicker.  Sometimes it will be dimmer then it goes bright again with should be. But I can tap the top and it gets bright again.  Besides that its a nice product.  Ty Venessa R.
"August 5, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This would be my second one on 3 years.  The first one began a slow leak after a while.  I needed a coffee maker without a breakable carafe and I do not like the pod coffee situation for our motorhome.  I would Order this again.
"April 6, 2019",Renepenny,2.0,,"We've purchased no less than 5 Hamilton Beach Brew Stations over the past 8 years and we put our first few coffee pots through their paces when we owned a residential care home and made multiple pots per day. We no longer have the care home, so our use is now ""normal"", but the Brewstation we purchased a year ago started leaking around the dispenser port after about 8 months. Considering my previous positive experience with Hamilton Beach products, I assumed it was just a fluke and ordered a new one. Our replacement Brewstation only made it 4 months before it started leaking in the same place.  It's now out of warranty, so I have no recourse other than hoping to save others the same experience."
"January 31, 2014",Mary Ann Beaton,4.0,,"it makes good coffee, is easy to use and looks good (guests comment that it looks like a single cup Keurig type brewer). Reading reviews, before buying, some commented that they would find it easier to pour the water into the Brewstation from the right side but "" pour water"" with a down arrow is printed on the left side! It does not matter, the water goes in the same place if you pour from the right. I find the Brewstations's coffee tank that you fill and pour into the Brewstation is large and its shape makes pouring awkward, so I use the glass carafe from my previous coffee maker as a measurer/pourer. I usually make 10 cups and fill the glass carafe with water to its 10 cup mark then pour it into the Brewstation. ""Cups"" do not equal mugs, so you get fewer mugs ( I get 6 mugs). I use paper coffee filters and I use 1 ""level"" measuring spoon Tablespoon of coffee for each cup(so 10 TB) (some think it is a bit strong). It takes 12 minutes to brew 10 cups and I think 15 minutes for 12 cups. If you use the bold button, it brews a few minutes longer. My husband drinks black coffee & thinks it is hot enough, but I add creamer and like hot coffee so once the creamer is added, I microwave for 30 seconds. I use various coffees, including Maxwell House - House Blend or its lite half cafe and Dunkin Donuts coffee and sometimes  will substitute a few of the Tablespoons with 2-3 Tablespoons of Melita Classic Blend for a more robust flavor. Be careful when you empty & clean that you do not press any of the buttons on the front, esp the power button. Coffee still tastes good if you reheat it later in the microwave.In conclusion, I like this coffee maker and would recommend it."
"May 24, 2021",Larry,4.0,,We really like this coffee maker. Would give it a 5 except for the funky tilted way the water reservoir looks.
"July 8, 2018",Joey S.,4.0,,"I like the option for 2-4 cups but I dislike that it does not come with 4 rubber feet to keep it from sliding when the cup is pushed against the paddle, I called Hamilton Beach and they said it only come wit two rubber feet. Could become a safety issue if the coffee maker slides off and someone gets burned. Be aware!"
"January 18, 2019",Dustin School,1.0,One,"Had a BrewStation for years prior to purchasing this new option.  Within months I was having problems.  The ""Clean"" alert would come in within a week and the warmer seems to burn the coffee.  Contacted HB and was sent a replacement, which costed me an extra $10.  It has been a month with the replacement and it is even worse than the first. I would not recommend this product.  The BrewStations are not what they used to be."
"August 5, 2019",R. Conrad,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker with reservoir that keeps coffee warm for 4 hours, easy to clean and no pot to lift. Works like a soda dispenser"
"August 5, 2019",Ladybug1,1.0,,We had one of these coffee makers for 3 years and decided to replace it.  The new brewstation internal coffee container does not sit flush AND it drips EVERY SINGLE TIME WE POUR COFFEE.  We never had ANY of these issues with our last brewstation.  Very disappointed!
"February 16, 2018",Amazon Customer,3.0,One,"Makes great coffee and keeps it hot, but is very noisy, burns coffee on the heating element, flimsy (lid on water broke day after I received it), and you cannot get a large mug under the dispenser. In addition, the filter mechanism does not fit securly in the slot for the filter."
"August 29, 2014",Dusty Rhodes,5.0,,Now this is the way a coffee pot should work. Very easy to set up in the mornings. No pouring the water from one container to another and really like the 'Keep Warm' options of between 1 and 4 hrs. Nice. Makes great coffee too. Update: After just 2 mos. of use the heating element seems to have quit working. Love the concept but like others have written....there are a few problems. The water seeping below the coffee container section is one. Short life of the heating element appears to be another. Loved it while it lasted.
"December 31, 2020",Suzanne Lewis,4.0,,This was my  first new one in years. Bought on at the store; it leaked.  Ordered this on; it leaked. Finally bought a red one. It leaks...
"April 7, 2021",Demosthenes,2.0,,"Worked great for a year, then started leaking brewed coffee from the bottom. Cleaned regularly, no visible leaks.  Second HR coffeemaker, so I'm bummed . . ."
"May 2, 2015",Matthew Braun,4.0,,"I've had it for 4 days.. I love it over our old cheap-o from Walmart.. I wish it drip water when taking out the coffee filter holder(that sites on top of the  ""pot"") ... also it not the easiest to poor water into once your poring in the last cup or two.... but over all the positives are a 4 HOUR delay is real nice!! .. every cup from the second its done brewing to the last cup taste the same even at the 4 hour mark. The coffee doesn't get a burnt taste towards the end(like normal coffee pots)... I would recommend this to everyone :D"
"August 22, 2016",bghmsh,2.0,,"This is a great coffee maker keeps the coffee warm for 4 hours , we have ours set to switch on at 6.45 am in the morning always delivers a good kup of coffee It only has one drawback It's very very hot , the just brewed coffee is at close to boiling point This morning my wife accidentally managed to spill coffee onto her hand - nasty burn. So buyer beware !"
"July 22, 2019",millbilly,5.0,,"Only thing I dislike about this coffee maker is that little water droplets/condensation forms on the inside of the top lid which if opened to fast, water gets on counter and requires clean up."
"February 6, 2019",Richard Rosson,4.0,,"My only issue with this coffee maker is that it takes a while to make a full pot.  But if you know what time you will need your next pot of coffee made, the timer function works well."
"March 30, 2021",Batgirl,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. It’s my second one. I’m very happy I could buy what I wanted at an affordable price.
"December 27, 2020",Mj,1.0,,We have bought this coffee pot over a period of 20 years....we do know and realize they do wear out so we keep purchasing this particular one but this time we realized that this was a little different than our other ones we bought so we gave it a try and all it does is leaks all over!! What a Big Disappointment!! I guess were all done buying this product.....that is why I’m requesting my money back!! COMPLETE FAIL!!
"January 20, 2018",Riccy Alvarado,2.0,,"I mainly purchased this because I wanted something that would keep my coffee warm during the several hours it takes me to finish it. I get caught up with my studying and forget to refill my mug frequently. This is just barely room temperature coffee. Not impressed by this product, not much different than an average coffee maker."
"October 18, 2016",DKLJJKAD,4.0,One,"Great coffee pot but we have to use one more tablespoon than before, because, even when we roast it on ""BOLD"", it still comes out weak.  Also, you have to be very careful when you pour it because the way the spout is made, you have to hold it about 4 inches above the narrow opening where the water goes, and so you end up spilling a bit if you're in a hurry."
"March 3, 2021",tia,2.0,,I love this coffee maker but leaks from bottom of maker and dispenser down side of coffee cup. Will be returning for refund as they don’t have any replacements. I hope it is just this one and not all makers with this problem.
"October 5, 2020",Maria Murphree,1.0,,"I bought the machine for the fillable water reservoir that could be taken to the sink. But when I used it, its is very noisy and sounds like it is on a continuous brew cycle. I asked Hamilton beach about it and all they said is that is the way it is and sorry for any inconvenience. Unacceptable, do not purchase this"
"December 1, 2012",SocialButterfly,5.0,2,"Looks great on the counter.  No drips.  No spills.  Takes a little getting used to, meaning, after the first couple of times of filling with water and coffee, I fully expected coffee to start pouring out of the spout.  Of course, that did not happen. It's quick, quiet and brews a great cup of coffee.  I like the dispenser.  No more dingy/burnt coffee pot.  Only two moving parts (the coffee basket and the water canister).  Its efficient, sleek and ultra modern.  Do I sound like a commercial?  Well, that's cuz this coffee pot does what it says and that's it and that's all."
"April 27, 2018",Shedly,5.0,,Well designed and functions superbly. I'm on my third one now as a daily brewer in 14 years. Cleans well. Makes delicious coffee and just keeps getting better with features. Fits well on countertop. Hamilton Beach hit a winner with this one.
"December 27, 2020",Matia,1.0,,"We love the idea of this coffee maker but the execution is terrible. You can see in my video that coffee not only pours from the spout but also behind the spout, creating a huge mess and waste. We’ve only had this thing a week and it’s always done this. It’s not old or worn out. Save yourself the frustration and find a different one."
"March 6, 2019",Shannon Keith,1.0,,absolute junk. bought this to replace my 4 cup pot and it stops brewing after 2 cups.  have to reset the water reservoir and turn it off and on again to have it brew more than 2 cups. not at all what I was expecting m worked great the first month and has been hit or miss since then. extremely disappointed
"December 14, 2020",Gail Thill,1.0,,I emailed Hamilton Beach and got no response about my coffee maker I purchased.  So every morning I have to wipe up the leakage off my counter.

"July 11, 2018",Stephanie Allen,5.0,One,I am in love with this coffee maker. It works just as it says it will. I wish it could fit my taller cups under it but that isn't a ding on the product. I love this coffee maker and I love this brand. Everything I have bought of theirs has worked great.
"January 7, 2021",Mark Weimer,5.0,,It's a good coffee unit.  You might want to think about re-packing the boxed unit in a larger box for shipping as the machine came damaged with a broken cover.
"February 24, 2021",Nancy,5.0,,"So easy to use,  it’s now easier  and faster to make a whole pot than making 1 cup .  Real timesaver for me."
"March 14, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Best, budget friendly coffee maker out there! You can set the timer so it makes coffee before I'm awake and keeps it warm for hours if a over sleep. I love that it dispenses the coffee at the push of a button. It's the little things.."
"January 2, 2017",Steph,5.0,One,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and her husband. I am a bit of a coffee snob and usually don't like coffee from flat bottomed coffee makers, but this machine makes some of the best coffee I've ever had. I was truly blown away. Can I give it 10 stars??"
"May 16, 2020",Justin Smith,5.0,,"This is the new and improved version of my favorite style of coffee maker. It really percolates your coffee, dispenses by the cup for multiple servings, keeping your coffee hot for up to 4 hours. If there was one flaw, it would be that I wish they would have aimed a little bit of light downward onto the cup so you could see it fill without much light on in the room."
"March 22, 2016",Vickie L. Andrews,4.0,One,"This is my 4th brew station.  My previous ones did not have a condensation problem like this one does. When I take the reservoir out, there is quite a lot of water below the heating element.  I make sure I use paper towels after each use to blot the water up.  Did not realize it at first, and the water almost ran over (It's black in the bottom & you could not see it). Other than that, it's still a really good coffee maker."
"May 22, 2019",sheri copeland,5.0,,"I have had this machine for a couple of months, use it daily and have not had any issues at all. Thank you."
"March 1, 2020",Barbara,3.0,,Loved the coffeemaker until it started to dip.  You cannot stop the dripping from coffee dispenser.  I don’t recommend
"September 2, 2017",Studio 54 - E Olson-Hulls,5.0,,It is better than the previous model I had where condensation always leaked down the back into the wells that held the coffee urn....... was tired of using a turkey baster to suck out the excess water so I bought a new one.  I still wish they would bring back the original 1st and second model... they were the BEST!
"January 7, 2019",Linda J Tartaglione,1.0,One,Coffeemaker stopped heating the water. Called manufacturer and was placed on hold for an hour and hung up only to call manufacturer back and find out they closed for the weekend. Terrible customer service !!!👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
"March 5, 2019",wb7vnf,5.0,,"This is our second Brew Station, we used our other one pretty much every day until it basically wore out - it is nice not to have to worry about breaking glass pots!"
"December 13, 2015",Bayou 52,1.0,2,"We've had three brewstations in 15 years and even got some friends to get one. The first one we received made so much noise and was so hot we thought it was defective. After getting the second one I don't think I'll ever get another one and that makes me unhappy since we LOVED it. Only have had this one for a few weeks and we should have returned it like we did for the first one we got but thought they made some changes, they did so DON'T GET THIS PRODUCT!! The element is so hot that it's NEVER QUIET (sounds like it's brewing till it's off) and the tank is so hot you can burn your hands. This isn't the quality product Hamilton Beach made before so WE ARE VERY DISAPOINTED and will replace when I find something similar."
"July 23, 2014",Jenni,4.0,,Surprisingly happy with this purchase. I hated my old cheap coffee maker. I wanted programmable brew for ready made coffee in the morning. At first I was disappointed in the coffee. But as I tinkered with it I added the BOLD setting and also let the machine get seasoned. I am now very happy with the taste and I love not having a glass caraf. It is simple to set up each night too. I choose to have the machine turn off shortly after brewing I find this keeps the coffee warm without scorching. I enjoy this all day long since I like cold coffee especially in summer.
"September 5, 2015",Harder,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker!!!! So easy to set up, clean, use and the price is awesome. Have had no spilling issues at all. I can make as much or as little coffee as I want, I have it set on bold and it shuts off on a timer so I don't have to remember. No glass for my kids to break or hot plates to get burned on (this hasn't happened yet but with three little boys it could right??) I would totally recommend this and would buy it again. I bought the recommended gold filter, it fits great and I didn't have to worry about it"
"May 26, 2016",Marsha S.,5.0,,"I really love this coffee maker!  Whatever bugs it may have had before, it seems to have been worked out!  It is so easy to fill the water reservoir with one hand...no more spilling water all over the place with the old ""bucket"" system...I just never was good at pouring water into the reservoir from the cannister bucket (not the fault of the previous model, just my lack of pouring ability) but this model solves all that.  Have had no issues and the coffee tases wonderful!  Love it!"
"July 10, 2021",alan,1.0,,"Awesome concept, but these don't last.  We've bought 3 of them in around 2 and a half years.  They have all started leaking after a couple of months, and then when they die, it's the heating element that goes.  I think we're going to look for something different this time, as this one is only 2 months old and is leaking."
"March 3, 2021",Terri,5.0,,"I have had several of these over the years, and I have to say that this one leaks while attempting to get a cup of coffee spilling it all over the countertop.  The one before it with a different design also leaked.  I have loved the Brew stations for a long time now, just not so much lately."
"January 2, 2021",Barbara Celmer,5.0,,I love this coffee maker!! I've had several of them....or I should say 3. They work great and you don't have to worry about a carafe.
"February 3, 2021",Res555,5.0,,The second one I ha e purchased. Have used it this machine for ever. Will always have one formy coffee.
"December 25, 2020",Deanna L. Thompson,1.0,,"It was not a fit at all for me. It took way to many steps to set up, and had an indicator beep for when the coffee was finished brewing that I found very annoying."
"May 9, 2016",Emh04,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker! We recently switch from single serve coffee back to drip. I loved the fact that this maker contains the coffee and keeps it warm and despences it on demand. It keeps the coffee nice and warm for up to 4 hours. My big concern was that the coffee would taste burned after being warm for 4 hours, and was really relieved to find out that it taste just as good after 4 hours. It is very easy to use and I am very satisfies with the maker!"
"July 20, 2019",joe g,2.0,,Like everything these days lasted less than 2 years Plastic parts fall apart  and leaks onto countertop . Old  style Mr. Coffee  lasted 10 years and was a third the cost.
"December 1, 2018",Feeling Fine,5.0,,"I love that this coffee pot brews with a timer and remains warm for 4 hours with out rebrewing (like my old percolator did) or making the coffee taste burnt.  I also love the small footprint, how easy it is to use and clean, and that you can dispense into a small cup."
"June 2, 2016",Angela Mehrer,5.0,,"This is my second one of these. Sadly, my first one started going after a couple years of hard use. I adore this coffeemaker! It's easy to use, keeps the coffee good and hot. After over a year of use, it did start getting water build up in the two small reservoirs, but I truly did not mind emptying it. Really, how hard is it to put paper towels to soak it up? 1 minute and your done. And it keeps it clean! I recommend this to all my family and friends."
"December 21, 2016",Squirrel!!,3.0,,"It's a good concept, worked well for us for about a year.  Now it's leaking pretty badly down the front, so not the best quality.  Also, the coffee comes out so slow now, because the filter just gets clogged up over time.  We clean it periodically per the instructions, but it doesn't help.  I even tried wire brushing the filter.  If it had renewable/replaceable filters, it would be much higher quality.  For 35 bucks though, lasting a year is pretty good."
"December 5, 2017",Karen Cochan,1.0,One,"We had one and it broke after a couple of years. Got another one, thinking that we use it a lot and we wore it out. New one leaks, is hard to fill without spilling water all over, and now it dumps the coffee back into the filling reservoir and rebrews the coffee in a non-stop cycle. Very disappointed."
"October 15, 2011",M. Young,5.0,,This purchase replaced one of similar design that we have been using for about 3 years.  The water sensor stopped working on the old one but it's not bad to get 3 years of daily work from any coffee maker anymore.  This model is much easier to dispense because they have created a slightly concave space  where the cup presses against the coffee release bar so the cup can get slightly closer to the machine.  This has helped to eliminate the problem of using thicker rimmed cups.  I believe they still make the other one with the flat stainless across the dispensing area so buyer beware!  This is our fourth brew station and the best design we have used so far.
"April 24, 2021",Beth E Ford,1.0,,"This is the second one I bought.  Bugs kept coming out of the first one. I have never had bugs before, but when I started using the coffee maker they came out of the bottom and when I opened up the top they were in where the water goes. The bugs were in both coffee makers I bought. I will never buy a coffee maker from amazon again!!!"
"December 16, 2015",MICHAEL P MCDONALD,4.0,,"Makes good coffee.  The timer is easy.  The auto shutoff works great.  Some of the taller tumblers may not fit easily beneath the dispenser.  As an improvement I would recommend a dispenser light.  When a tall cup is used, it's difficult to see inside the cup to tell if the cup will overflow.  A little light by the dispenser would improve visibility.  One downside...the decanter that holds the brewed coffee is not dishwasher safe.  There are too many plastic parts that could be damaged by the hot air drying cycle of a dishwasher.  There is a heating element in the decanter that cannot be put in the dishwasher."
"September 18, 2013",ruby,5.0,One,"Our household is in love with these Brewstation coffeemakers -- easy dispensing, no carafe to break.  But we bought several over the last few years, and each one started to leak and got worse and worse until it was unusable.  Then the last one wouldn't make more than 2 cups at a time.  So we changed to this model.  And beyond the wonderful new feature where it fits a go-cup, it's making really good coffee and working great.  I'm a little cautious because of prior experience, but as of now, 5 stars!"
"October 11, 2019",jeremy,2.0,,"It would only brew 3/4 of the water in the reservoir, sometimes only half. You have to turn it off and back on. I bought the older version to replace it."
"September 15, 2013",GS,4.0,,We had to return the first coffee maker -it had some problems but we loved the coffee that it made so we got a replacement instead of a refund. The second one works fine. The coffee is delicious and my husband drinks it black and he he loves the flavor. My only negative comment (4 instead of 5 stars) is that the keep warm feature is OK for the first two hours but after that the coffee starts to acquire a burned flavor. We keep out coffee in a carafe so we solved that problem. The dispenser works well and the controls are easy to use. Clean-up is standard.
"May 28, 2020",William Denton,5.0,,Oftentimes I leave for work before my wife gets up. With this I can brew coffee take what I need and she has a hot cup waiting for her.
"July 4, 2021",Stacey,4.0,,My glass pot burst so when I looked at replacing it it was just cheaper to buy a new coffee machine.
"November 12, 2018",QueenB,5.0,,This is our 3rd brew station in many years. No carafe to break. Just put your cup under the spout and fill it up. We don't like keurig type machines...coffee is too weak. So this is the perfect compromise.
"April 8, 2016",Harley,4.0,,"I purchased this more for my house-sitter than for me. She enjoys a GOOD cup of coffee and my really cheap coffee maker broke. For an inexpensive maker this makes good coffee. Its easy to set up and use. My house-sitter even complimented me on the machine and how much better the coffee tastes :). So if you are looking for a coffee maker than won't break the bank, buy this one."
"June 5, 2018",cat,1.0,One,Coffee tastes like plastic and burnt - I am assuming from the internal hot plate/carafe. I gave it away in less than a year and bought a black and decker with carafe.
"October 23, 2019",L. Riddle,1.0,,"Bought this mid August. Now it's mid October. Product failed without warning. It looks like the control panel went out. It was a great concept, and we were excited about it having used a similar one in hotels. Not sure if we got a lemon, but won't buy it again."
"July 22, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is our favorite coffee maker and we have been purchasing these for the past 5 years. Highly recommend if you like the ability to have multiple cups of hot coffee ready to go for up to 4 hrs.
"October 26, 2015",Heath Johnson,5.0,,"First thing I'll lead off with is the one annoying thing.  The space between the little grate and the spout where the coffee comes out is short.  Most tumblers won't fit, you have to come in at an angle.  I use this daily, I have used it to make coffee right away and I have used it with the timer.  It all works and works great.  Much nicer than a pot.  I wouldn't buy a pot one again  Simple to use and clean.  Very happy with this!"
"January 1, 2016",Karen M.,1.0,5,We had an older version of this coffee maker for the last 4 years that worked well until recently.  It was used every day at least once per day.  We thought we would replace it with another one like it.  This one arrived yesterday and while brewing coffee will leak about 2 cups worth of water onto the counter.  We tried it a few times but the water appears each time on the counter. It is going to be returned.
"September 30, 2019",Maria,1.0,,Dispenser button is already broken and we have had this for barely a month. Great concept and worked well until the dispenser stopped working. The button sticks when pushed in and we have to pry it out with a knife. Now to dispenser the coffee we have the hold our mug in one hand and press the left side of the button to dispenser.
"February 9, 2018",Amy Beth Luthor,5.0,,Awesome coffee maker! Makes great tadting coffee. Love the removable water reservoir. Love not having a glass carafe to break. Love that the water section and the coffee section are separate. Love the liquid dispenser. And seriously love the iced coffee making abilities! Lots of other features too.
"January 5, 2017",Design Mom,1.0,8,"When our old coffee maker broke we looked for a new innovative yet affordable options. This brewer seemed appealing because it was to keep coffee hot without burning it and was easy to dispense. We used this coffee maker for about two weeks and are very disappointed. Here is why: * golden filter recommended and purchased did not fit properly as we couldn't fully close the lid * this machine is not easy to fill up with water as it ends up splattering all over the counter * it is even harder to clean as the condensation that accumulates drips everywhere unless you coffee maker is located next to a sink * coffee reservoir is made of plastic and although it is labledb as BPA free, I can't help but wonder what happens to coffee that is sitting hot in a plastic container for up to 4 hours Pros: * we liked that this maker makes 12 cups of coffee * dispensing was easy I would not recommend it as I feel this product is poorly designed."
"February 21, 2016",Miami Lyric,4.0,One,"I've had this for a few months. It works well, and makes decent coffee. The coffee is hot enough, and stays hot in the reservoir. I haven't had any problems with it. I've taken off a star because I have to hold the machine in order to press my mug to get a pour. If it's sitting against a wall, I imagine you won't have this issue, since that'll hold it in place, but I have deep counters with cabinets above the back, so I have to pull it forward while in use. If I don't hold it, the pushing action pushes the machine, and not the pour button. It's not a huge deal, but just slightly annoying."
"June 11, 2019",nana hunt,5.0,,I had to steal one from the camper to bring home - wore out my third one at home so this is a replacement for the camper. They last and I will never go back to a carafe pot.
"November 26, 2016",angelop3,4.0,One,"Great way to brew coffee and serve it without a carafe!  It took a few days to get used to not having a carafe, but it is now a nice way to pour a cup of coffee.  The machine parts are a bit bulky and awkward to use, but I'm getting used to how this machine works. Wish this coffee maker was made with a material other than plastic.  I'll be using it for awhile."
"April 5, 2020",Mark,3.0,One,I have had Only owned this coffee maker for a couple months and it has started to leak all over when it brews.
"May 4, 2016",Marco Herrera,3.0,,"Like the concept, coffee dispenser. Purchased before we moved into our new home. Moved in and the coffee pot won't fit under our cabinets...so measure ahead of time. Tried putting in a spot without a cabinet overhead and the cord is too short. Needless to say if I could return it I would. Positives: keeps the coffee hot up to 4 hours, can just press and get coffee. Other negatives...you have to take the whole thing Part just to fill with water. Synopsis...if you don't have my variables get it...if you do, don't buy it."
"March 15, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Owned unit for a few months. The weep holes that recirculate the moisture from inside the lid to inside the coffee reservoir do not do as intended and the water instead drains on to the heating coil which could possibly cause an electrical fire. Amazon would not help me with replacing the unit and told me to take it up with Hamilton beach. What a hassle, thanks for making this an easy process Amazon."
"February 18, 2021",PWB,1.0,,"I previously had lots of good coffee pots from Hamilton Beach, but this one is terrible.  I've had trouble with those without a external pot/carafe, but this one is terrible."
"July 8, 2020",Dennis R Brannon Jr,3.0,,I like this coffee maker but dont love it. I wish it had a single led light at the dispenser so you could see how much coffee if filling up your cup. Its dark under there. Could also use a rubber button so it didn't slide all over rhe counter when filling a cup. I have to hold the machine in place to keep it from sliding.
"August 22, 2019",Patricia K. Brewer,1.0,,"I have purchased several of this same model of coffee maker for years.  However, this one is incredibly loud after the brew cycle is complete.  I contacted Hamilton Beach and was told this is normal.  It is not normal.  I would not purchase again."
"July 25, 2020",Cynthia F. Rabe,4.0,,I purchased this because I thought the coffee would not burn like other makers but it is the same as others.
"September 4, 2019",Yaya,1.0,,I love this coffee station because it was easy for my mom she is 80 yo and has a hard time with the glass one. So I got this one and it only lasted 1 month it started to leak and I try everything to troubleshoot it but nothing work. I try calling Hamilton beach always a 20 minute wait on the phone. Trying to talk to Amazon now about returning it.
"December 4, 2019",Deborah Poliks,5.0,,"Very excited about this product.  I can just put my cup or travel mug underneath and pour. Quick and easy and go.  Also it has an hour timer on it to keep your coffee warm and shut off automatically when done . Love this product, Cant believe all these years I did without."
"October 6, 2019",Trixie,5.0,,What i love is that there is no glass pot to break which i did all the time. Also keeps coffee hot for hours!
"August 21, 2014",Karl R. Schneider,5.0,2,"Makes plenty good hot coffee, the detachable water tank is a great feature.  We had an older model that was messy to fill but it worked fine for several years,  the program startup failed recently so I replaced it with this one, my only complaint is a minor one, the blue display is VERY bright and it shines into my bedroom...I taped some aluminum foil over it to stop that annoyance.  Anyway so far it is working great, I have no regrets."
"April 2, 2019",Pamela,1.0,One,"Our family decided to go back to using a regular coffee pot because we were using so many kcups everyday and they are bad for the environment.  Unfortunately, this coffee maker is not what we were hoping it be. Instead every morning clean up has become a routine. This morning it was worse because the water has dripped off the counter and onto the floor."
"August 10, 2019",Lonnie C Talbert,3.0,,Easy to use good coffee just a little flimsy and makes noise after coffee done brewing until you turn off the coffee maker ! Maybe should have spent more for higher grade model ?
"December 6, 2018",L. Caslin,4.0,,I would have given it 5 stars if the condensation on the inside of the lid wasn't so bad and leaked everywhere when opened. I thought the coffee would stay hotter but it doesn't. The good thing about this coffee maker is that the coffee does not taste burned after sitting a couple of hours.
"December 15, 2013",KReitz,5.0,,"I've been making my coffee using either a French Press or Chemex for the better part of three years. Over time our coffee drinking habits changed and it became too much of a hassle to keep using those for everyday use. I'm not going to get into the decision making process, but we settled a Brewstation. Reading reviews, it seemed like the only common complaint was that the spout was too far back, causing spillage down the back side of the mug. I have been trying to duplicate this problem over the 4 days that I've had it, and I cannot... it seems 100% fine to me. Go for it."
"March 9, 2020",Roger Brown,2.0,,"Design flaws. Loading water into this product is a two-step process. You have to pour the water into one receptacle, then into a second. The design also results in awkward, sloppy pouring from the first to the next. Also, the whole thing slides backwards when you press your cup against the dispenser. And you have a bad line of sight, so it’s hard to see when your cup is getting full. Finally a 6-cup measurement results in about two cups of actual coffee. After 10 months, I’ve replaced this product."
"May 31, 2020",Theresa Steinmann,4.0,,"I really love this pot.I drink coffee all day long and now it stays hot,love it. The only problem is the spout leaks when you take the coffee,does anyone have a solution for this?"
"December 14, 2019",Herbert Abbott,4.0,,"I replaced the older version which did very well. This one seemed to be an improvement, but now I must wash three items to two previously. The old unit gripped the countertop so that getting a cup of coffee was a one-handed operation. this unit slides with pressure on the fill valve, so it takes two hands. Still, the coffee is tasty and I am OK with my purchase."
"October 17, 2020",NonniandPoppi,5.0,,The side water tank is so easy and convenient. The coffee maker keeps the brewed coffee at the right temperature. I recommend it.
"January 6, 2013",Mary Ann Wingard,4.0,,My daughter really likes this gift but it's taking some getting used to.  You can't put the unit where the coffee stays warm into the dishwasher so that is a negative since she uses the dishwasher for everything.  She loves that you push the front of the machine to get the coffee out and there is no dribbling like with a regular coffee pot.  The ability to tell it how long to keep the coffee warm is a real plus.  I'm sure over time she won't want to do without it but it's new and different so it's just taking some getting used to.
"February 17, 2020",Lawrence Pace,1.0,,Coffee makers leaking already did not last long at all. I would not buy this at all. The important parts ar cheap and causes leakage
"August 19, 2011",HPinAZ,3.0,One,"I like this coffee pot for it's features, setting the clock, choosing the strength, and choosing how long it stays on the hot plate. However, I find it very cumbersome to make the coffee because you have to take off the filter piece to get to the water chamber.  It is also a little awkward to pour the water in to the bottom from the water bucket to the chamber. I often like to make one extra cup of fresh coffee in the afternoon so although doing this once a day is livable, that extra cup hardly seems worth it. Overall, I will use it until it breaks but I would likely look for another option next time. Cobblo"
"June 16, 2021",Marie C.,5.0,,"I love the fact that I can time the brew and also I can set it for 4 hours and it doesn’t taste burnt. The only thing I noticed, the basket doesn’t sit on the base too well."
"April 28, 2020",Jesus Quiroz,2.0,,"Used for a couple of days but mechanism to pour out coffee broke within a week.  Everything was great, good coffe, easy to use and easy to clean but broke and had to send it back"
"January 29, 2019",tamala m.,1.0,One,Just got it yesterday set it up last night to go off this morning got up and all the water had leaked out of the water reservoir seen this in reviews but thought we would give it a try going to be sending back very dissappointed
"November 17, 2016",Marcy Strom,2.0,,"We returned this coffee maker after two attempts at making coffee in it. The rubber stopper that should keep the coffee in the internal carafe is attached on a flimsy hinge/spring set up that kept getting off center and leaving a gap that emptied the entire contents of the pot into the counter. I was really disappointed in this maker as the idea of no glass carafe really appealed to me, but I can't keep pouring coffee all over my kitchen!"
"June 24, 2020",Rebecca,2.0,,I've had a Hamilton Beach coffee maker similar to this one for several years and really liked it.  This one will not program correctly.  Goes to Iced Coffee and it is hard to reprogram.  I have to push the Iced Coffee button hard just to get it to make coffee and it is frustrating.  I would send it back if it wasn't so much problem and I have discarded my other one which was partially functioning.
"July 9, 2018",RealEstaGrl72,5.0,,"I bought this machine 3 years ago and today it died. I'm not writing a negative review however, this is a positive one! I have bought other brands in the past that didn't last 6 months. This one lasted 3 years! I just ordered my second one.."
"February 21, 2020",Genna J,4.0,,Only issue is that the brewer is really loud. I had a previous model and I like the new design.
"January 12, 2017",Michelle,5.0,,"I had the older version of this model where the water tank was below the coffee tank. We ended up trashing it because we couldn't get rid of the horrible tadte that filtered into it. However, with this model we can now clean both the water tank and the coffee tank and I have way more faith in it. Our original Hamilton Beach lasted 3 years and would have lasted longer had I been able to clean that water tank. Cheers to a good cup of coffee!!"
"March 18, 2019",Mary Ellen Porcelli,1.0,One,"I was given this coffee maker as a gift.  it was  was easy to use,  made good coffee, but after only about 2 months of daily use, started leaking from the bottom.  Pot was cleaned as per instruction manual.  I thought maybe this was a defective coffeemaker, so I bought another one from Amazon.  This also worked well for about 2 months, and started leaking just like the last one.  Waste of money for a defective product."
"February 20, 2020",Animal Lover,2.0,,Easy to clean and easy to use while it lasted. Less than a year and it was leaking out of the bottom.
"January 30, 2018",Kent Pearce,2.0,,"Concerns with the new brew station, coffee is really hot.  Coffee sitting in the carafe it is at a roaring boil.  I called the Manufacturer & was told that this is ""Totally normal"".  This is my second brew station.  I loved it because carafe can keep coffee fresh for up to 4 hours.  My coffee now is not too fresh after boiling for 4 hours. I have concerns as to why is it so hot & could it become a fire hazard?"
"February 19, 2021",Lori E.,2.0,,This is our fourth one. The first was fine we’re out second one ended up leaking from the pourspout. Got a replacement it late automatically. Returned for a new one. The new one leaks again. I’m calling Hamilton Beach now
"September 13, 2019",Jim,1.0,,"The machine started making a popping sound and failed to brew anything. The electronic face blinked a few times before going dark. When I called Hamilton Beach, I was informed I would need to pay them shipping in order to get a new machine. Not wanting to sink more money in an unreliable appliance, I decided to buy a Cuisinart because of their better reviews are superior customer service."
"August 20, 2018",CDWB,5.0,,"Super easy to use, makes a great cup of coffee, and no carafe to break.  I simply love this new coffeemaker.  It replaces one of those pod brewers that kept breaking.  It's easy to clean and has a removable water reservoir.  I gave it five stars for all of the reasons listed."
"June 30, 2018",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I really like the brew station for the convenience of not having to fiddle with a pot or carafe. What I do not like is not having the ability to reheat the coffee in the station, when it has already shut off after brewing, or when I forgot to  turn on the keep heated feature. Upon selecting the on button, the station beeps and asks for water to be placed in the brewing unit."
"July 16, 2020",Vanilla Jean,3.0,,"To many parts to separate to make a pot of coffee and to clean, it does make a great cup of coffee but  More parts than I would like"
"March 23, 2013",Gina,2.0,5,"So, this is my third Hamilton Beach 12 cup coffee maker.  I did really love the last two which lasted about 2 years each.  This will, sadly, be the last one I purchase.  I first came to this brand from Krups.  After breaking a carafe too many times, I realized that I, perhaps, am a clutz and should seek an alternative.  These coffee makers really are great.  There is a three hour time difference between me and the other coffee drinker in the house and with a four hour timer, this just fits the bill perfectly.  The coffee is hot and fresh and what more could you want. I would hope that someone from Hamilton Beach would maybe take the time to read this....WHERE IS YOUR MARKET RESEARCH?  Do you actually ever USE your product?  Who is telling you that this is a good design?  Do you have a person that would test these BEFORE you manufacture it? --As other reviews stated the condensation from the heat of this coffee maker causes a drip down the back right at the plug!  Such a fire hazard that I can't believe that someone actually did not flag this as an inferior, dangerous, not really practical way to go. --Also, the design of this particular model adds a bit of stupidity--to what should be a better design, not worse.  In theory products should continually improve as time progresses.  This does not.  The lid is attached to the entire unit, so that if you open the lid, while it is hot, more water pours down the back to the plug. --You can't lift the water holding part until you lift the coffee grounds part. --I hate this coffee maker.  Cleaning it has become a pain in the neck.  I try to wait for it to cool first, but I don't always have the luxury of time. This is the most poorly designed HB product I have owned.  I would not purchase again.  Buyer Beware."
"January 8, 2020",Sheila,5.0,,This is a little slower than I'm used to.  Have cleaned it and adjusted the brew cycle.  Not a bad coffee maker  but waiting for it to brew can be hard and dispensing is slow.
"May 15, 2020",Dawne Cooper,2.0,,I have purchased this same Coffee Maker for years. I ordered one a few weeks back and it worked great. Then all if a sudden it will not draw the water to make tje Coffee. I am so frustrated. I have to turn it off and then back on to make the Coffee like twenty times.
"March 17, 2021",Milton S.,5.0,,My wife and I really like this model coffee pot.  Generally they have held up really well.  We use it every morning.  The reservoir is much easier to clean compared to a coffee pot.  There is  a bold brew that intensifies the flavor.  I highly recommend this product.
"March 20, 2018",Debie L. Bodjanac,5.0,,I like this idea of not having to bother with a glass carafe.  The coffee taste better and state warm in the chamber just waiting for you to put your up to the serving are to get A cup of coffee.  We found that we do not use as much coffee to get a good strong cup of coffee.
"January 27, 2019",Charles C Williams Jr,2.0,,This coffee maker does not make hot coffee and it stays at room temp.  I did not even own this one for 2 months and it started leaking all the water out of the reservoir when I set it up to make coffee in the morning.  Lucky for me it was early and I caught the mess before hand to shut it off.  I rather not get a replacement since this did not last that long
"November 19, 2017",PJB,3.0,,It works nice but it does take time to clean and you cannot fill it to the top of the 12 cup mark you must fill it to the bottom of the 12 cup mark or it will leak. So many crevices to clean but love the keep warm choice up to 4 hours just make sure there's a few cups to keep warm because it will burn or taste bitter. If drinking say 20 minutes after brewing BE CAREFUL IT GETS EXTREMELY HOT!
"June 28, 2018",KTE,5.0,,We have owned this for almost 10 months and it works perfectly.  There is a learning curve because the brew strength is different than the traditional carafe coffee maker.  We enjoy having a hot fresh cup of coffee throughout the day.
"August 21, 2016",Merilee F,5.0,,"I absolutely love this machine!!!!  It works like a charm and keeps the coffee HOT!!!  I LOVE MY COFFEE HOT!!! I use the timer so it is made at the same time everyday and stays hot and fresh.  I read other reviews about it pouring out funky.... that is BS.... it comes out perfect each and every time!  They must have bad aim... lol.  I would buy this machine again, and would give it as a gift.  Good price compared to the stores."
"August 12, 2020",Meme,3.0,,We have had a Hamilton beach coffee pot before that was great. This one leaks every time we get a cup of coffee. We have to put a napkin on the base to catch the drips
"February 14, 2018","Recording Artist, Author, Wife, Mom, and Friend",4.0,,Never enjoy pouring the water from that cumbersome pitcher. It's heavy and awkward to lift and spill. But I LOVE this machine and I love holding my cup against it and seeing the coffee come out hot and fresh. No mess and no pouring. SWEET!

"April 11, 2015",Granny's Purse,5.0,,"My husband and I just love this coffee maker.  It's easy to clean, easy to fill, makes great coffee and has settings for the amount of time you want it to stay warm for up to 4 hours.  If 4 hours isn't long enough you can turn it back on to warm for another 4 hours and the coffee never tastes ""burnt"".  It has a small foot print so it doesn't take up much counter space.  I would recommend this coffee maker to my friends and family.  Well done."
"October 8, 2012",gem,4.0,,"This is my 4th Brewstation, and I wouldn't have any other coffe maker.  Love the fact that there's no glass carafe to chip or break. (Usually chipped it within the first month)  The problem I've had with 2 of the previous 3 was not with the coffee maker, but the pouring mechanism wore out.  Despite that, I still highly recommend the Brewstation.  The assembly of this model is a little awkward, because you have to remove the ""pot"" and basket to fill with water.  I've had a couple others that filled from the back, without needing to remove the ""pot"", and I would recommend that type over this one.  For safety's sake, I always unplug the coffee maker when we're done using it, so that means the time etc. has to be reset each time it's used.  I found out you need to make sure you select how long to keep the warmer on (1-4 hrs.) before making coffee, as it defaults to zero, and can't be reset once the coffee's made.  The added height of this one makes it easier to pour into a travel mug than other models I've owned. All in all, very pleased with this coffee maker."
"July 13, 2019",Jewel F,5.0,,This is our third one. I gave one as a gift and this is the second one for us. We make a lot of coffee and the first one lasted for almost 3 years. Hope this one works as well.
"June 28, 2017",Lynda Scott,3.0,,"I have had other (now replaced) models of this coffee maker that we just loved even though their life span wasn't that great.  However, the model changed and  while this is convenient and makes good coffee it is VERY NOISY brewing on our quartz counter top.  It also takes up more room as the water canister is now on the side rather within.  This will probably be our last purchase of this type of coffee maker."
"December 17, 2020",Karen J Tordella,1.0,,"This coffee maker is noisy. After the coffee is brewed, the warmer makes a gurgling noise. It sounds like the coffee is boiling. The coffee is good, but the noisy warmer is very annoying. I wish I had returned it. I can’t wait til it breaks so I can buy a different coffee maker."
"June 9, 2014",Kindle Customer,1.0,5,"This is our second Hamilton Beach Brew Station dispensing coffee maker.  The last one lasted over 8 years, even with our hard water. I liked the new design of this style, with the easy to fill side section for the water.  Only problem is, the water leaks into the area between the heating section, and where the brewed coffee is kept.  It hisses and bubbles every time we use it,and there is a lot of water that has to be removed from under the ""coffee tank"".  Of course, this didn't happen until right after it was too late to return the stupid thing.  I will not be trying another Hamilton Beach product."
"May 29, 2020",Suzy Savajian,1.0,,"I have had my old Hamilton Beach coffee pot for years.  I bought my daughter this model and then turned around and bought myself one as well.  I didn't realize my daughter hadn't opened hers until it was too late.  Both of these coffee pots leak.  You need something to clean up all of the coffee on your counters after you get yourself a cup.  Reading all of these similar reviews makes me wonder, WHY is this coffee pot still on the market.  Hamilton Beach, I have lost my faith in you."
"October 23, 2016",Pest 2,4.0,,"This is my third one of these coffee makers.  They make great coffee and never have to worry about breaking a glass pot.  But as all I have had,  they start to leak water after 2+ years.  So will expect that from this one to.  But better than paying alot more money for one's with glass pots,  and also leak after a while to."
"October 29, 2020",Maggie Mae,1.0,,"Water would not go from reservoir to brewer.  Took 3 or more ""shut off, turn on"" to get coffee made. Coffee was undrinkable.  Went back to an old, cheap drip coffee maker we had.  Ordered a different Hamilton Beach coffee maker.  Like the potless type coffee maker."
"January 28, 2019",Chantell Romero,2.0,,"We bought this thinking that a) it would not burn coffee since it's advertised to keep it hot for 4 hours, but the coffee tastes burned after 1 hour; b) another disappointment is how it leaks underneath the maker and makes a mess on the counter top; c) and when it reaches the bottom of the tank when dispensing, it makes a mess; d) the whole tank has to be lifted out to pour the water so additional moisture and water on the counter top. CONCLUSION: I would not suggest buying this since it's not worth the additional money, it doesn't do anything special and makes a mess. Buy Mr. Coffee for less than $20 and save yourself disappointment and money."
"August 15, 2019",beachdonna,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  Best of all, setting the clock and the timer is so easy.  With no carafe, you can simply press a button to have your coffee kept warm for up to 4 hours.  It is extremely easy to clean!  The coffee tastes great.....no burnt taste when keeping it warm.  If you are on the fence about this coffee maker,  don't be.  Put it in your cart and don't look back."
"July 30, 2018",Jessica,2.0,,"We've only had this for a couple months, and I'm already looking for a replacement.  It doesn't properly drain the water tank. As result,  10 cups of water only new 4 cups of coffee,  with five to six cups still left in the water tank.  I have to hit brew 3 to 4 times just to get it to brew 8 cups.  It will never seem to drain the last cup or so.  Also,  it seems to be set too hot.  you can hear the brewed coffee constantly boiling.  It ruins the flavor of the coffee and gives it that ""burnt"" taste."
"April 3, 2019",Carde,2.0,,It worked fine at first.  We noticed that it was making noise and got louder this past week.  We then noticed that it wasn't making 10 cups when we put 10 cups of water in it.  It was only making 6 or 8.  We looked at the water reservoir and saw that there was still a few cups worth of water in it.  Yesterday 4/2 we asked if we could return it because it was defective and Amazon sent in a return receipt.  Sent it back today.
"February 25, 2019",Morgan Miller,5.0,,"Easy and classic coffee maker. I love that it doesn't have a coffee pot, and in its place has a ""dispenser"" . Very easy to use at the office, with a 4 hour warmer to keep things warm. Great purchase!"
"August 1, 2019",Keith A. Klingensmith,5.0,,I love this coffee maker.  I got it in the mail this afternoon.  And I had 4 cups so far. Thank you. Keep up the good work.
"March 28, 2019",David B.,5.0,,"We had an earlier version of this coffee maker, and we really liked it. It finally wore out, so we got this updated one and like it even better. It has some additional features and looks better on the counter due to the additional stainless steel front panel."
"April 24, 2019",steve cassady,1.0,,"One star, only because no stars is not an option.  Second time purchasing the same product, but this one, though possessing improved features, failed faster in the same way as its predecessor: after a mere few months of daily use, it shuts off at first after brewing four cups when selector is positioned to full pot, and later two cups.  Am junking it in favor of different brand.  Nice features, good price.  Only problem, it doesn't work.  POS product."
"January 24, 2019",Mary K. Smalley,5.0,,This is our favorite coffee maker.  It is easy to use.  It is much more convenient being able to take the water tank to the sink.  It is very fast. Buy it!
"October 16, 2019",Shelley Aswegan,2.0,,"Don't waste your money! Bought this for the camper, only used on the weekends and after about 5 times it stopped working! Didn't suck the water correctly."
"January 18, 2019",claire Reis,4.0,,"Bought for the work breaks,Makes great coffee easy to set timer so coffee is ready when we arrive,have not figured out how to make iced coffee yet,But as a women I have not read the directions yet either--lol"
"February 17, 2021",Frank J. Tuma,5.0,,Excellent product. Coffee is much hotter than our previous coffee maker. Easy to clean and maintain.
"February 17, 2020",Becky J Kosters,1.0,,This is our 2nd or 3rd coffee pot of this design and we had always loved them.  This one however started malfunctioning about 1 to 2 months after we bought it.  It will only brew a couple of cups at a time and then you have to restart it to get it to brew a couple of more.  Not very convenient in the morning when you would just like a full pot of coffee.
"June 3, 2021",James Brown,1.0,,"Leaked every where! We got this to replace our three year old coffee maker because it leaked, but this replacement was even worse!"
"November 9, 2016",paul r.,1.0,4,"At first we were excited about this coffee maker, but a seal broke or something and now it no longer holds the coffee and leaks everywhere. The coffee stained several important items. Major disappointment. Now we have to find a way to return it."
"April 16, 2018",PhilG,5.0,,"I really like this coffee maker.  I had a similar model years ago, but it didn't have a detachable water container.  Being able to fill it in the sink and place it back in the coffer maker is very convenient.  The only thing I wish it had would be a signal when the brewing is complete."
"January 19, 2019",Shawn K.,5.0,,"When I received this, I instantly put it to use and made myself some coffee.  (first I cleaned it by running a cycle of water with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar through it).  The coffee tastes very very good. Not like plastic as so many coffee makers do to coffee.  Especially the ones made in China...what isn't these days...so I was pleased.  The features work as advertised and I like the conveniences that this maker has to offer.  Easy to set up and use right away and program to make your coffee ready-made for your next morning's enjoyment."
"July 13, 2020",J&A Traina,2.0,,"Bought this in Nov 2019, I'm writing this review in July 2020. I've used this everyday, clean it out often, wipe it down to keep it free of dirt and dust. It no longer brews all of the water I put in the reservoir and have to turn it off then on again to finish brewing. The words and on/ off button are no longer seen on the machine."
"November 26, 2014",JerseyDad,2.0,,"This is my second Brewstation. First one developed a leak after 3 years or so. Not too bad, but I wish it had held up better. Not surprising, as the build doesn't feel that great on these. This product has been less successful for me. Lost one of the rubber feet after a couple of weeks. And when filling my cup, the dispenser leads once the resevoir gets to the bottom. There's no way to know when it's at the bottom; with the old model, the flow would just stop. With this model, it drips down the stainless wall, onto my fingers (ouch), down my cup and onto the counter. It's a bummer. I love the fact that it keeps the coffee in drinkable shape for 4-hours, but I don't think I'd buy one again. Just feels too shoddy."
"March 13, 2021",Jwilson,1.0,,"I loved the first one at our vacation home so much that I purchased another for our primary home. No carafe to deal with & easy to clean. However, the 2nd one I purchased leaks terribly around the button that releases coffee.  I have a mess to clean up every morning!  The first one would get 5 stars but not the 2nd one."
"July 23, 2020",Vandergriff,5.0,,Great coffee maker! I’ve always enjoyed pressing a button for coffee instead of picking up a coffee pot. This one keeps the coffee very hot and having options for how long is cool! Haven’t tried the ice coffee option yet.
"April 11, 2020",ALH,2.0,,Ours is leaking and leaves a ring of coffee on the counter after every use. I had it for about a month before the problem started. Leaking from the area of the coffee storage where the screws are at. Super annoying.
"October 10, 2020",SVoi,3.0,,"At first, we loved this coffee maker, it was recommended by a friend. It even arrived a little early which was nice. However after ONLY 5 MONTHS - it is leaking all over my countertops. I thought it was being overfilled, but no, that wasn’t it either. Then, it just shorted out. Super disappointed. Won’t be purchasing another."
"July 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"I am so disappointed.  We had this coffee maker for years and it began to leak when pouring so ordered new one.  First week it was great, now it is leaking when we push mug to fill cup.  Will be returning and will probably order another type since we love the way you can just fill one cup at a time.  Hoping we just got a defective one."
"January 2, 2017",Jewell,5.0,One,"This is my favorite coffee maker, and my third one over many years. I like not having to use a carafe.  The design changes every time I need a new one, but the coffee tastes great.  It's easy to use and the others last for years.  I hope this one does, too."
"July 28, 2016",calfborn,2.0,One,"The description for this brewstation says dishwasher safe the directions. say not. I am trying to find out if the water tank can be immersed in hot soapy water ..... Can't get an answer!! Bought the newer model payed more because it says the water tank can be washed. Nice if description and directions mached... To be fair loved my other brewstation, made great coffee and lived a long life with a heavy coffee drinker."
"January 15, 2017",3ATM,4.0,One,"I love this coffee maker! But it only got 4 stars for 2 design flaws. Please fix these 2 issues: 1. The LCD can be half the brightness, I don't need my kitchen illuminated. 2. There should be an LED where the coffee is dispensed so you can see if you a pressing the release lever and when the cup get full."
"January 5, 2017",dndobson,5.0,One,"I've had this coffee maker for a over a year now and I still love it. I especially love not having a coffee pot.  The coffee stored in the upper reservoir stays warm for as long as you leave it in. It brews coffee quickly and it's easy to clean. Some cups are too tall to fit, but tilting them usually works.  And it looks good."
"July 29, 2019",Deacon George Valdez,1.0,,After a year it started leaking water when I set it overnight. I began to make coffee in the morning adding the water and starting. Seem to work fine for a month. Now it started to leak the coffee. Very disappointed. I know this was buy as is/refurbish but the info on this coffee maker said lite scratches. Shouldn't have broken down after one year!!!
"December 22, 2017",Lynne B,3.0,,"I received this yesterday. The Amazon box was pristine, but the product box itself had been punctured in a few places. As this is a gift, I unboxed it to make sure nothing was wrong or broken on the machine itself. It was fine, but the box itself was not."
"May 20, 2017",Buckeye Gal Bridgette,1.0,,"I love the concept of this coffee maker. I have had it less than a month and it quit working. The 3 weeks I did use it, it brews loud, gurgles loud when getting the last of the water out of the reservoir, then after brewing it constantly sizzles (I am not sure where that noise is coming from). I am not happy at all with the quality of this coffee maker. For me it was a waste of money."
"February 9, 2020",Easy Day,5.0,,"I love that there in carafe, I set it and when I wake up every morning my coffee is ready."
"August 19, 2015",cmp,4.0,4,"This is our second Brew Station in about 15 years. We obviously liked the old one enough to replace it with another when it finally gave up, but there are some differences. The Brew Station line brews whole pots of coffee, but inside the machine instead of a traditional glass carafe. It has a dispensing bar to get the individual cups of coffee out, but please do not mistake it for a single brew type maker (like a Keurig.) We have found over the years that the lack of the glass carafe makes for better tasting, never ""burned"" coffee flavor, and we do not mind the lack of a carafe. My mother-in-law, on the other hand, prefers to bring a carafe to the table for serving, and therefore isn't a fan of this design when she comes to visit. I would urge you to think about that when you are considering this purchase. But, if you are like us, this is an excellent coffee maker. The look is modern and sleek. The coffee brews quickly, and this new model lets you know when it's time to run a vinegar cleaning cycle, which is a bonus. You can set the internal heat to stay on for 1, 2, or 4 hours, and it's programmable for waking up to a brewed pot. You can also set different brew strengths, convenient if you sometimes make a small amount. And, as opposed to the old model, the reservoir is flat bottomed, making it easier to get the right amount of water, and the markings both on the reservoir and inside the brewer are much easier to read. A tall to-go cup fits well under the dispenser. Those are all good things, and based on them, I'd give it 5 stars. The reasons for me going with 4 stars are some design/human factors elements that are sadly not as good as the old one we had (again, by the same company.) Pardon me for doing a little bit of comparison to an older model, but this is why I don't like this one quite as much. These reasons may be a little bit personal to me as far as it being where I have to keep the coffee maker, but I think enough people also keep one on their kitchen counter, tucked away under the upper cabinets. If you don't, these issues may not affect you. It is (and always has been) a tall machine. The former models had a reservoir/basket/lid that completely lifted off the top of the brewer. This meant three separate pieces had to be assembled to make the coffee, but I could lift the whole thing off while the brewer remained under the upper cabinets. This model has a flip top lid. I imagine they were trying to make it easier to put it together. In practical terms, though, the flip top will NOT flip up under the cabinet, so I have to pull the machine forward on the countertop to brew the coffee. And, in the old model, there were small metal ball bearings on the bottom so that the machine could be rolled. It again may have changed as a ""fix"" in Hamilton Beach's thoughts, as people would push too hard on the dispenser bar and have the machine move. On this model, rollers would be ideal, since I have to move it in and out so much from under the cabinet, yet it instead has very stable rubber feet that don't allow it to move back and forth. Ah well. Overall, I highly recommend this coffee maker. If it was the first model I had, and I didn't know the difference from my old one, I would probably have rated it 5 stars."
"July 3, 2021",SuzyQ,5.0,,"Great for people tired of K cups,  but want the use of a single drip coffee maker such as the Keurig style, this single drip coffee maker uses the traditional style of a 10-12 coffee pot.  It holds up to 12 cups, keeps warm for up to 4 hours, has settings for delayed start."
"May 31, 2021",Meghan Christensen,2.0,,"It is super loud. Also when you are cleaning it or changing the coffee, it spills everywhere due to its design. I wouldn’t recommend to  buy"
"August 3, 2020",Ilsa Ortega,3.0,,"The one thing I have about this product, it didn’t last long. Less than a year and already broke down... wow. I’ve had 10 dollar coffee makers last longer"
"December 3, 2014",Pilot Rod,3.0,,"So, here at my house we drink tons of coffee. We brew 2-4 times every day. The previous version of this coffee maker unfortunately was superior to this one. It does a great job of brewing coffee, so much so that I bought this same model 2 times. I would rate it at the 4 star range if it weren't for the design flaws. The biggest flaw is that the dispensing nozzle is very close to the releasing button, in other words when dispensing into a thermal mug that has a good thickness all around you will spill coffee at the start and end of the refilling process. That being said, if you do not fill mugs via the dispensing mechanism this would be a 4 star for you! Another design issue is that it does tend to burn or overheat the coffee if you leave it there for too long, spoiling the taste. Overall it brews coffee at the 4 star range but then it looses points due to design issues."
"February 10, 2018",CZWDSTCK,5.0,,"Highly recommended - old coffee maker was a fill-the-pot with water then pour it into the coffee maker - a mess and an additional ""step"" - with this one, the reservoir comes off, put it under the sink and fill it.  No extra glass pot (to hit on the side of the sink and BREAK...) - love it."
"October 13, 2019",Jose A. Zapata,5.0,,Easy to use and a great gift. I like the option to brew a single-serve any time I need to.
"February 16, 2021",matt,5.0,,real nice for making coffee easy to clean. coffee good and hot . good price good brand name . reaal happpy all in all
"December 20, 2019",Ranses H.,5.0,,"Best coffee machine we ever had in our house. We saw this type of brewer at a hotel we were staying. We loved it so much we decided to get one. Here it is, easy to program. There is coffee for everyone at the house and it is always hot. Not need to reheat in the microwave after a couple of hours if you decided to stay in bed and have your cup of coffee later."
"August 3, 2018",Jerry,2.0,,"After coffee brewed it doesn't stay hot. If coffee is reheated it tastes burnt.  Would not recommend, would not buy again. Will probably send back for refund. Jerry"
"July 1, 2021",Dawn B.,5.0,,We had our previous one for 15 years and look forward to this one lasting just as long.
"March 2, 2020",Amanda j Davis,2.0,,"This is my 3rd make/model since 2009. I’m not to thrilled with it leaking water everywhere, every time I use this. I already had one that constantly leaked water. I wanted a new one to fix that issue but it didn’t seem to work at all."
"June 21, 2018",scoons7499,4.0,,"Okay, I love this coffee pot but a couple of things not so appealing. 1.) The clock light is WAY TOO bright - would be great if you could dim it, and 2.) Would be nice if there were a light at the dispenser to see how much coffee you are pouring in your cup. Other than that it's a great coffee maker."
"May 10, 2020",pita1419,1.0,,"I have bought this machine a few times over the years but a different model. This model is different because it leaks (see picture)! From the first use it has leaked coffee onto the counter. I will never again buy this coffee maker in this model. Since I have used it for the past few weeks I’m not sure I can return it. So, I will buy the other model that I have bought in the past, from Bed Bath and Beyond. Very dissatisfied and disappointed!"
"January 12, 2020",Thankful,3.0,,Loved being able to preset time and coffee would be ready whenever we got up. Disliked the fact that it started dripping coffee and would make a big mess unless we put something under the spout to catch the overflow.
"July 10, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"We upgraded to this edition after we exasperated an earlier version of the Hamilton Beach BrewStation.  The side fill for the water is much easier and I find this one easier to clean that the earlier versions but not the easiest.  Our coffee is good, stays super hot and looks sharp on the counter. Would purchase again and would recommend."
"June 6, 2013",W.,5.0,One,"I had the Hamilton Beach 6 cup Coffeemaker for over four years and it made great coffee and still is functional, but decided to go with this one and upgrade a bit, kept the old one for a backup. This one makes up to twelve cups and has buttons for hours to keep the coffee warm, Brew strength(1-4cups and bold). Just tried it out and looks like a keeper, only can hope it lasts as long as the previous one. Two day delivery with Prime is wonderful."
"May 7, 2020",Cindie,5.0,,Love this coffee maker! I had another Hamilton Beach like it but love the water dispenser you fill to make the coffee! So much easier than having to pour it in!! Definitely recommend !
"July 18, 2019",JF,1.0,,This coffee maker has an incredibly poor design and is very difficult to clean when trying to prepare for a new coffee. You have to hold onto a top or back portion which is usually very hot to prevent you from tipping over the machine because you’re pushing your cup into a button to allow the coffee to enter a cup. This leaks everywhere drips everywhere when you’re trying to replace water.  I would not recommend this product
"September 23, 2020",mike martin,1.0,,"The perfect coffee maker until it started leaking and the display went out.  This happened after only about a year and a half and mr. Coffee would do nothing about it.  In fact, the same model continues to get the same complaints.  Dont recommend"
"March 1, 2021",JOHNIE,2.0,,"The hubby really wanted this and when we got it it leaked (poured) out coffee at dispense button, sent it back for a replacement and this one leaks too 😞 Not a happy camper my husband waned it so bad that he has made adjustments to this one it still leaks but not like it did. Too pricey to have not just 1 leak but 2... Not a satisfied customer... 😕😒"
"July 20, 2018",Barbara Brauch,5.0,,"I've used this brand and model of coffee maker for years.  We like the design, with the coffee staying inside of the unit, and using the dispenser to pour a cup of coffee.  No need to pick up a glass pot.  Also, the evaporated water stays inside, so the coffee doesn't get stronger and bitter."
"February 5, 2021",Wac Veteran,5.0,,"I've had one of these before, but the price was the best.  Brews fast and easy to set."
"January 29, 2021",Teresa,1.0,,"They leak and make a mess, I've had three and I finally learned my lesson and wont buy another."
"March 4, 2019",Maxmillion,5.0,,"The HB brewmaster makes really good coffee, is easy to clean and easy to program. My first HB brewmaster lasted nearly 10 years. This has a smaller footprint and I like that I can select how long to keep the coffee hot. I really loved my old HB. I hope the new one is as great as the first."
"January 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"The appliance itself has a very cheap feel to it. It works pretty decent and I like the multiple settings it allows such as brewing only 1 to 4 cups and setting the hours you would like to keep the Coffee warm. On that note, the coffee is only lukewarm when it first comes out of the pot which is frustrating when you want a hot cup right away."
"February 23, 2021",J A Carter,5.0,,"Best coffee maker I've ever bought, and I've bought a few.  I like the fact that it doesn't have a carafe  but a  reservoir that dispenses coffee when you want."
"April 23, 2019",john chen,2.0,,I have been use this for a couple mouths ..until now..still don’t know how to keep Coffee warm..I already set up keep warm..but after a couple hours..it got cold..
"November 6, 2020",Andrea Kelley,1.0,,Broke in less than 3 months got a cheaper one after the replacement only lasted 6 months
"May 25, 2021",Fl Keys,5.0,,works great been using this model for years.  has about  a four or five year lifespan
"May 27, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I was really excited about getting this coffee maker. My cousin has one and I love it. But upon cleaning it this morning, I noticed it looked like it had been used. I payed for a new coffee maker and therefore expected a new one but this was not the case. I feel like I got ripped off. I’m sending it it back."
"December 8, 2020",K.T. A.,1.0,,I had the older version of this coffee maker and LOVED it but the newer version is just not the same.  The newer version allows hot coffee to leak out around the dispenser lever when you are trying to fill up your cup and that makes quite a mess.  I returned the coffee maker and got a replacement which did the same thing.
"July 13, 2013",Ray V,5.0,,"Serious coffee drinker here! Purchased the cheaper 6 cup maker of H.B. that was junk. This is a total upgrade for a good price, still! No messes like the leaky 6 cup cheaper one, just a straight robust pour. Everything mechanical works great & can handle a crowd of java heads no problem. No need to break the bank for a fancy coffee maker here, just a straight forward good brewer here on time. Plus the lit timer is nice, & it looks good. Finally a reliable brewer w/o the spills, or high price tag."
"April 16, 2021",Boston slasher,3.0,,Purchased after original brewstation broke after 15 years. This one doesnt keep the coffee hot. Love the fact that it doesnt need a pot and you just press cup against dispenser but not staying hot is a deal breaker. had to send it  back.
"May 13, 2021",F. Brassington,3.0,,I like that keeps the coffee warm for four hours. That I don’t like that it steams up so badly when brewing the coffee there’s water everywhere. Also the light up to show you the time is entirely too bright and should have a turn down button or some thing.
"December 12, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I have spent so much time cleaning up the leaks, dripping and floor that I don’t have time to write much. In short - DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER. It should die in the fiery fires of hell fire."
"December 20, 2019",kmg,1.0,,water leaks everywhere and can't use anymore after only 3 weeks.  can't return to amazon so have to just junk it.  waste.
"December 8, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Disappointed in the amount of coffee brewed.  It says it holds 12 cups of coffee but only if each cup is 4.83 ounces. No where in description did it state actual ounces only that it makes 12 cups of coffee, so we were duped.  It works fine but in this Big Coffee drinking household we will probably wear this little brewstation out soon. A cup is 8 ounces in America not 4.83 ounces."
"April 21, 2020",Jessica,2.0,,"This is my second Brewstation. last one I had for many many years and it finally just started leaking too often.  Rubber grommet didn't seal right anymore. But this one, leaks EVERY TIME I dispense coffee. And it's light. So it moves every time I push the dispenser.  Pretty annoying.  Sorry I purchased it quite honestly. Beware!"
"August 7, 2020",Joe Bogie,4.0,,"I love everything about this except that's there's a small leak from somewhere so when I make coffee there's a little bit that leaks out of somewhere underneath it that I need to wipe up. So, minor inconvenience and everything else is awesome!!! and I love the convenience of sticking my cup underneath it and having the coffee poured for me."
"March 3, 2021",Megan,1.0,,"I thought this would be a really neat concept, but not so much. The flavor of the coffee wasn't anything to get excited about, it was just coffee. But the most irritating thing was that when I would dispense the coffee into any sort of cup it would also dribble down the side from the spout. Wasted so much coffee, made such a huge mess all the time. It was definitely not worth it."
"February 25, 2014",L. A. Holland,5.0,One,"Hands down....the best coffeemaker out there. I absolutely love this product... so much that I  also bought one for my 87 year old quilting buddy, who has problems with her hands/wrists. VERY easy to use, maintain, fill.  Coffee tastes much ""cleaner"" and  the keep warm feature  somehow prevents coffee tasting burnt. I've probably owned 25+ coffee makers in my lifetime and this one is by far the best.  I strongly recommend this product."
"October 2, 2016",Gary Pruitt,3.0,,"It seems to be well made,  easy to make coffee.  I just wished they would have put a little light under the dispenser.  If your going to make a dispenser like a dispenser on a refrigerator. Then put a little light under the dispenser like a refrigerator has.  Other then that.  the timer and controls all work. Makes a great cup of coffee"
"August 10, 2020",Katie,5.0,,I had one before and liked it.  Best part is that there is no glass carafe for the coffee.
"December 11, 2017",guanabona,2.0,,"Worked decently for a year-and-a-half and then shat the bed. No longer squirts out the last few cups, and even the first few come out very slow Trickle. We try cleaning it with vinegar, and I took the thing apart and reinserted the little rubber gasket but nothing could fix the problem."
"April 7, 2015",Ctaylor,2.0,One,"This was purchased as a replacement for Hamilton Beach 10-cup coffee maker.  The design is not the same.  This has on the side water reservoir.  Cannot be purchased without it.  After 6 months of use the receptacle under the coffee holding reservoir fills with water with every use.  It has to be ""mopped up"" before making coffee for the next morning.  Design failure somewhere but too late for a return.  When we first experienced this problem we checked other reviews and saw that we are not the only one with the issue.  We love the concept of no carafe but had to go back to using a coffee maker with a carafe.  Too bad Hamilton Beach.  You had a good thing going before the last design change."
"March 5, 2020",TP,5.0,,Best coffee maker ever. Easy to set up. Turn on the timer and wake up to the smell of coffee. No pouring. Push your cup against the button and it fills up.
"April 13, 2021",John M,5.0,,Does what its intended to do. Same one I had before so works like a charm. Great buy
"October 19, 2015",jeanne,2.0,,"Bought this same brew station three years ago and returned it as it would not stop boiling the coffee....constant boil sound...so I bought the old style brew station,  you pour the water in...worked o.k..decided to up grade as hubby was spilling the water trying to pour it in....so we ordered the model #47950 with the side resivore.....guess the problem has never been fixed as the first one still made lots of noise...Amazon sent another one...thank you Amazon....same problem...and when I try to call Hamilton Beach for two weeks I get they are having tech difficulties with there phone  lines.......Rats !  I love the concept but not the constant noise.....I have now owned six of these brew stations......all seem to have issues"
"July 7, 2020",msbrandy,1.0,,"Great little coffee pot for a month.. Then as soon as the deadline to return it, it starts leaking. Not a great product. Very sad."
"October 1, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I own 2 of these coffee pots. One at home and one at the lake. I love that they don’t have a glass pot.
"June 18, 2016",C. Lucero,5.0,One,I absolutely love this coffee maker.  It is programmable (a big plus) and it is not messy for filter changing or water adding.  I also like the fact that I am not dealing with a glass coffee pot.  The less pieces the better.  Highly recommend this.
"October 20, 2018",Mark Hobson,5.0,,The machine makes good coffee and does keep it hot. The self serve feature is great. My only complaint is that the first machine that we received leaked!  We were able to return it and the replacement has been fine. We went with this model because we have had a similar one that still works after 10 years!
"July 6, 2013",Mr. T,2.0,,"i've had this ""brew station for about 2 months now, it worked 95% to it's visual appeal, aside from the fact that it still burns the coffee it worked without a hitch. I was a little concerned about the condensation from the lid and worried it may eventually cause a circuit malfunction like my last coffee pot. I wish the problem would be so simple. Instead it's the annoying ""dispenser spring thing"", out of nowhere it decides it doesn't want to stay put. I had to waste 2 batches of some extremely delicious coffee to see what the problem was, and it's the tiniest peg you'll ever see for a high tech contraption such as this, and the damn thing keeps sliding over and popping out. Basically this machine is all big for nothing and fancy looking but it's not good for long term use at all. The peg wasn't even broken it just started popping out with every cup. Talk about the ghost in the machine. And what really yanked my chain is when i went looking for the warranty and i remembered i threw it away with the box because it ""looked"" way to impressive to malfunction the way it did. Luckily i only wasted 40 bucks on this scrap heap. this thing is the biggest waste of space for my kitchen i've ever had. the coffee tastes great, but the sudden spaz of hot coconut coffee pouring seemingly unstoppable all over my counter was not what i had in mind.  don't waste your money."
"February 26, 2020",Kristen Wilson,2.0,,"I bought This same machine 4 years ago and we moved so I bought The same one so I had It asap when we got to the new place. However, I’ve had to buy TWO of the same make and model since February as they keep breaking and I’m rather upset about it."
"July 3, 2017",amber,5.0,One,I had the same coffee pot and loved it!! It worked great until the spring broke and the coffee couldn't come out. I saw the used ones on Amazon for like half price.I looked at reviews of other purchasers and took a chance.I am very happy with the coffee pot!! I just kept my old one for parts if i ever need them. I love that this coffee pot!!  It doesn't have a carafe that can be broken is a real plus!!
"June 14, 2021",Bryan Ludlam,1.0,,"LEAKS! I used this coffee maker for about a month and then it started leaking water from the bottom.  After another three weeks of constantly soaking up water on the counter, down the cabinet and into the floor,  I stopped using it. I will avoid purchasing anything from Hamilton Beach in the future."
"November 22, 2016",Nick B,5.0,,"This coffee maker is great! Very easy to set up and use. Love that I can fill up my big mug with exact amount of water I need and boom, it's ready in the morning. I am not one to drink a whole pot of coffee or drink it all day. This is perfect for my morning routine and simple to us."
"April 5, 2019",cheryl,4.0,,"Nice design, with all removable parts.  Easy to fill  removable water canister.  The internal coffee holder also removes, and is easy to wash out in the sink.  The one issue I do have is that this coffee maker is very lightweight, and can slide on the counter when dispensing your coffee in the mug.  You will need to hold on to it when pressing the lever.  The coffee is a good temperature so overall I am pleased."
"June 3, 2021",Rob Jones,4.0,,"The coffeemaker works as promised. However, the rubber stopper at the bottom will get a coffee grind in it from time to time. The result of having said grind under the stopper is hot coffee dripping out and onto your counter. In addition, the gauge to see how much coffee is still in the container fogs up, and cannot be read."
"January 22, 2020",Mrs.SSmith,3.0,,Update: this coffee pot didnt make it a full year before it messed up. I like this coffee maker for the most part. I have only had it a few months and the buttons are rubbing off and I don't like that because now it looks shabby.
"February 12, 2019",Lillian D Beyer,5.0,,"we love this coffee maker.  it doesn't have a glass carafe so nothing to break.  You make the coffee like you normally would, but use your cup underneath to get the coffee out.  I'ts cleaner and more convenient than a regular coffee maker."
"August 6, 2018",jerry,2.0,,"Works ok, but don't let it set an hour, it will leak. This is my 2nd unit the first started leaking after about a year. This one lasted 6 months before it started leaking from the cup filling area. If I want to let it set with coffee on the warm setting I have to set an empty cup under the dispense area."
"January 11, 2021",heavy 5819,5.0,,"No spilling cause you are still half asleep, no pot to wash just good coffee ready when wake."
"June 9, 2020",Tari P,5.0,,"have noticed with my last 3 purchases, the separate parts do not fit as snug. love the lower price"
"April 9, 2019",D. Szymanski,5.0,,"Coffee maker works great!  I have a tiny issue with pouring water from the 'basket' into the machine, but I guess that's just me.  Love the dispenser way of getting coffee instead of having to pour it."
"March 17, 2021",Nic&Sean,1.0,,We got this to replace an 8 year old brewstation that I dropped the coffee tank and broke it. The first one leaked as soon as coffee started being brewed in to it the tank leaked out the side and coffee was all over my counter. We exchanged it. The replacement leaked worse. Other than the leaking it was a nice coffee maker.
"February 23, 2020",Wen,5.0,,Enjoyed my own so bought this as a gift. Love that you don’t need a coffee pot.
"April 8, 2018",Daniel Ellliott,1.0,One,"This was a replacement for one that arrived with a broken  program button. This one worked great until 5 days ago.(30 days up).  Now the program button is broke on this coffee maker. Evidently, Amazon has received a bad batch of this coffee maker brand. Ordinarily, Hamilton Beach is a quality product. Daniel Elliott"
"October 25, 2019",dana leslie,2.0,,"Like that it makes coffee. Don’t like that it does not make 12 cups of coffee, more like 8 possibly 9 at most. The warmer plate burns the coffee and has the taste. The water reservoir leans away from the coffee maker. The dispenser is hard to push"
"November 19, 2019",SaraZ,5.0,,I love this because there is no glass pot to worry about breaking! Easy to clean
"February 26, 2019",Linda Blackmon,1.0,,"I bought this coffee maker to replace a similar one by the same company. We were happy with the old one but it didn't keep the coffee hot any longer. This is the newer model. This is the worst coffee maker I've ever had. We cannot get a decent cup of coffee out of it and are cutting our losses  and going to try and buy another kind. Life's too short to have bad coffee everyday. It just tasted off- burnt, and  the coffee is lukewarm."
"May 11, 2014",Just Me,5.0,,"Been using mine for about a year now, and so far I've had no problems with it at all. It's got a decent range of functions for a coffee machine, has a pretty decent capacity, and works great for my needs. The only thing I don't much care for is the height.  You can fit a regular size coffee cup in to fill it up quite easily enough, but if you want to fill a travel cup or anything taller you have to fill it at somewhat of an awkward angle, which can lead to a little bit of clean up later.  Other than that I'm very happy with this coffee maker."
"October 25, 2020",Bryan,4.0,,"Had to go with 4 stars as it was missing the front rubber stops so have to use double sided tape so it doesn’t slide on counter, amazon gave a 5.00 credit for the issue and won’t need to return."
"March 21, 2016",Yeahright Noway,3.0,,"I want to like it but 1.) the thing is insanely slow to make a pot. 2.) coffee is not really hot enough, especially once you add refrigerated creamer. 3.) it's kind of difficult to fill this with water without dripping water everywhere. Add it up and it = go back to Mr.Coffee. It also has issues with pour spout that doesn't pour out cleanly...water goes down the back of the spout and drips all down the sides just like this. But it's quicker and hot."
"January 29, 2020",gman57,3.0,,"I did not give 5 stars even though I like the ease of use and brewing flavor because the warm cycle makes a lot of noise, almost a boiling noise.  When it gets near the last cup the heating element in the coffee holder starts to burn.  Last cup taste burnt and have to scrap the burnt coffee off the element."
"May 5, 2016",PJ,5.0,,"A friend of mine had one of the older versions of this around the time Keurig became so popular. I was always pretty impressed with how innovative it was and how it seemed to keep the coffee at just the right temp and was super convenient to use. As soon as my parents and sister saw mine, they ended up getting them, too.."
"April 13, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,So far no issues. Love this coffee pot. Easy to use and clean. Love that i don’t have to deal with a pot. Not a fan of the pod coffee makers. I’ve had a very expensive one and didn’t care for it. Fill like his is easier to clean and there is less bacteria build up.
"May 21, 2021",kyle,5.0,,Love my new coffee maker. Fresh flavor and easy to use an clean. No standing water in a tank.
"May 13, 2016",Kassandra Rios,1.0,2,This coffee maker was awesome for the first 2 weeks.... Then it decided to stop working. It turns itself off when it wants to even though we have it set to stay on for 4 hours so our coffee is often cold when we go for a cup and it never makes the full amount  we set it for 8 cups and we're lucky if it makes 4
"May 18, 2020",Laura,5.0,,Our last coffee maker of this brand and style lasted over 20 years until my daughter dropped the water cavern and broke it. Hoping that this one lasts as long. Wish I would have kept the filter on the old one because the new one didn't come with it.
"May 12, 2021",StephanieS,4.0,,Had it 2 years now. Now it leaks when you fill the tub up for the coffee. Really sucks cause we loved it.
"January 11, 2021",corky broadway,3.0,,I liked the overall design of this coffee maker. It leaked a trickle when I used it the first time. I figured I must not be doing something right. I continued to use it but it continued to leak with each use. I can't have coffee under the unit and trickling down from the dispenser. I purchased another brand and I returned this one. DO NOT BUY this one!!
"May 30, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Love this coffee maker.  I’ve used this model for many years.  I order a new one when it starts slowing down.  This is my forth or fifth. I’m so afraid they’ll stop making them.  Love walking up to the maker and just getting enough coffee to warm my cup full up.
"September 2, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Came in a timely fashion and well packed. It's very easy to use and I really like not having that pesky carafe! We bought the reusable filter and it is a breeze. It does take a little (very little) getting used to as far as filling it with water and then setting it back correctly. I already bought a second one to have downstairs for guests. I've had no problems with mine and I've had it a year now.
"March 16, 2021",shawna t.,1.0,,"This coffee pot leaks upon pouring and there is constantly a mess on my countertop. We bought this machine as a replacement to the previous model, which we absolutely love. Also, the water reservoir is in the base of the machine and is not removable to fill up.  This Version is garbage and wish I could return but procrastination ate up my window."
"December 9, 2019",Alanon,3.0,,Easy to set up. The only problem I have is the 4hr keep warm feature doesnt work.
"October 6, 2019",susan,4.0,,"Great coffee maker for the price. Very lightweight so when you press your cup to pour the coffee, it pushes the coffee pot to the wall. It needs a light very hard to see if coffee is pouring down. Not a coffee machine for the long run."
"March 27, 2021",Eric,2.0,,"Leaks when pouring. Had to set it on a tray so our countertop doesn't get stained every day. Also, I'm not a fan of warmers that burn the coffee flavor. Opted for the Capresso 10-cup model with thermal carafe instead and threw this away after less than 6 months of daily use."
"October 27, 2014",Allana,2.0,One,"I bought this as an upgrade to one of the earlier BrewStations I bought almost 5 years ago, which worked great but was getting a bit old. Having such great coffee with the first Brewstation, which i bought as a gift for my boyfriend, i decided to go with this one as an anniversary gift (in honor of the 1st one that cost only $25 at the time!). It worked well for all of 3 months!! The water was not being pulled from the reservoir and the light just blinks and makes a clicking sound. It looks really nice, but don't bother wasting your money on it."
"June 15, 2016",Justina T.,3.0,4,"Pros- Time and Timer are easy to set. (Make sure you light the ""start time"" button though, I forgot that my first time) Buttons are big and easy to read, perfect for coffee-less brain in the mornings. You can set up in the evenings, and wake up to fresh coffee. Stays heated for 4 hours- letting you know when a it's time to start a fresh pot. Despite other reviews, push button and dispenser are easy to use, and there is enough allowance for even a big lipped mug Only takes a few minutes to brew 12 cups You can pick your brew strength. Cons- No internal memory for clock- must be reset with each unplug The design is a bit odd, with several baskets, water reservoir took me a minute to even find. Beeps mercilessly when finished, not super loud, but would be enough to wake my kids up You need to have a pitcher of some sort handy to fill it up since you dont have a carafe. While it does heat for 4 hours, it's not very hot at all- might be a preference thing Overall: I like it. I haven't updated my coffee pot in 5 years and was in need of something with a few more bells and whistles. I really bought it for the timer, which now that I know it beeps until you push a button, I wont end up using because I have kids who need sleep. Honestly, I would not have purchased it if I knew it was going to be noisy."
"February 28, 2021",Jessica Bellone,5.0,,Great quality for the price! Don’t have to ever worry about breaking the coffee pot!
"October 9, 2019",JDM,5.0,,The coffee is HOT The coffee tasted amazing The Coffee Pot is RECOMMENDED !
"January 13, 2013",C. Anderson,5.0,,"I had an older version of this coffee maker that died after 6 or 7 years, and did not hesitate to buy this version despite some bad reviews. Why? because these make the best coffee of any coffee maker I have ever had. It has to be because of the plastic container in combination with the heating element. And a wonderful bonus is, the last cup is every bit as good as the first, even if it has been warming for 6 or 8 hours. I haven't had any of the issues that some other reviewers have talked about with dripping or leaking, it just works!"
"May 2, 2021",Abigail,1.0,One,"Works well, but it leaks everywhere from the bottom! So frustrating, especially because I am unable to return it. It also leaks when filling up any cup. So it leaks from the underside and also from the push paddle:( !"
"September 5, 2014",Cami,5.0,,"This product works exactly as the other reviewers said it would. It leaks just like some say. I have to hold the whole unit when pressing the dispenser button.The detachable water unit sometimes does not fit snugly into place. Great concept though. I keep a towel under it and push it against the back of the countertop. I have had this unit for a couple of months now so I imagine I will be encountering the rest of it's quirks in the future  The coffee itself is good so far and is hot, as long as I don't set it on 1-4 cups. If you are a patient, understanding person who does not expect perfection then this is the coffeemaker for you. I am giving it 5 stars because it truly lives up to it's reputation. :)"
"May 5, 2021",Randall Johnson,2.0,,"I love the idea of the separate water tank but for some reason there is water and coffee that collects under the coffee pot collector tank in the area of the heater. I have had several brew stations and have enjoyed them very much, till this one."
"November 28, 2018",PALong,4.0,,"I loved my first one -- there is only two of us and it keep the coffee hot, without boiling, for four hours.  It's a 'single pour' system as you use your cup to push in the lever to release the coffee but when it's just the two of us (99% of the time), it's the BEST."
"January 9, 2018",Grace,5.0,,My husband and I love this brew station! You can choose to keep the coffee warm up to four hours you can program it so your coffee’s ready in the morning when you get up and it also has a brew strength. This  is our second one the other one never broke it just got so much wear and tear we wanted a new fresh one for our countertop!
"March 22, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,2,"We got a new Hampton Beach coffee maker because we like the ""no carafe"" feature. This is the 3rd one we have bought that leaks and I am ready to try a new brand. We got this on 3/20/19, and I am not impressed. The container that holds the coffee does not sit steady in the machine either."
"October 16, 2017",M S Napier,5.0,,"We love this coffee maker. It's not the Most elite model but it does so many things very well, and for the price it's just great. Our coffee never tasted so good, and the flexibility of the machine, for us, is great. We bought Mom one, and another one to give to the kids. Great machine for a reasonable price--worth the extra $ over the simple Mr. C / B&D models that kept messing up--so frustrating! This one is just right!"
"December 31, 2020",Robert Meadows,1.0,,Have already gotten rid of it! Front right below clock started leaking. Constantly moving around. No quality as far as staying in place. Pain in the ..s to deal with. Went and bought a $ 20 Mr. Coffee and loving it!
"January 7, 2016",mindoverfatter,1.0,One,"Well, it makes coffee, but the heating element makes it only lukewarm. When I add a splash of milk, it's cold. I don't like hot coffee...but it is literally cold. Plus, I have to take the entire thing apart to add water. I have used it a number of times since Christmas as it was the only one I had otherwise I would return it. Terrible machine."
"June 17, 2020",Raphael Montgomery,3.0,,"Makes great coffee.  Not very user friendly. This machine dispersed coffee by pressing a cup to a button. When dispensing coffee,  the machine must be against a wall or some other surface as the entire machine will move because the coffee release button is too high.  Additionally, about a month after getting the machine, the water reservoir began to leak, so we can’t use the timer function."
"August 16, 2013",His-story,2.0,2,"Very disappointing based off the reviews for this item.  I need to brew just 2 cups of coffee/day (one batch) and with the 1-4 cup setting I thought it could make a hot cup of coffee.  Barely drinkable at best with it being barely warm at all, not sure if this defective or that coffee brewers these days are made to brew much larger batches.  This is a great concept so I gave it 2 stars but if your coffee isn't hot then what's the point.  Looking elsewhere for a small batch convenient coffeemaker..."
"April 8, 2021",cathy bond,5.0,,Perfect dispensing one cup at a time. Able to use your own coffee. No pods
"January 5, 2016",Victoria,1.0,2,Thought that this would be a great product. So it was bought as a gift for Christmas. The only positive thing to say is that you are able to get as much coffee as you want at one time. Besides that the reheat function is horrible. Takes almost 2 hours to reheat coffee.  There is no option to program and have heated coffee at a certain time unless you want to waste 6 cups of coffee and start a fresh brew. Definitely dont recommend!
"October 27, 2012",Annie,5.0,,"our first hamilton beach 48465 coffee maker had the drip spout too close to the back...you could NEVER pour a cup w/o making a complete mess. I dealt with it...  then one day I cleaned it probably a bit too much and the whole thing just began leaking all over. I had read some of the reviews...some had problems, some didn't --all model # 48465. I ordered through amazon (I had taken some loose change over to one of those coin machines and amazon was one of those options where you didn't have to pay a fee to redeem)... and got lucky! this is the best coffee maker we have ever had. The spout is in a much better position, far enough forward so there plenty of room for the cup lip, no leakage. Finally."
"August 22, 2020",Barbara Kothman,1.0,,"I loved this coffee pot. Ease of use was great. Twice in the past week I have had coffee all over my counter. I clean the pot regularly and rinse it every day as well. I would not recommend this pot to anyone,"
"August 13, 2019",V. Brink,5.0,,I absolutely love this coffee pot. It's easy to clean and has a little light that comes on when it needs cleaning. I like that I can make more coffee when the coffee reservoir is half full.
"October 24, 2019",Louie Z.,1.0,,". The problem is that it can slide and thus be annoying. There’s suppose to be 4 mini suction type things for the bottom. It only came with 2. I added 2 but it still slides when you push the coffee cup against it........ Few months later, new review: Its leaking from the bottom! Coffee all over the place! So can I return it ?"
"June 18, 2017",Hateslaundry,5.0,,"I'm very picky with my small appliances. I love this coffee maker because I don't have pots to wash and takes up less space. Buttons seem a bit cheap but easy to work. For the price and options (amount of coffee, 1-12 cups with easy to measure liquid guide and  BOLD option) I am happy with my purchase"
"May 17, 2021",mammy,5.0,,I love this coffee maker! Easy to make a few cups or a full pot and super easy to clean.
"January 3, 2014",BQualls,4.0,One,"This is the second Hamilton Beach coffee maker that I have purchased with an year.  I liked the one I had so much I purchased one for a family member.  With all of the other fancy coffee makers out there, this one holds its own with simplicity.  If you want all of the bells and whistles, this is probably not the coffee pot for you.  If you want to up to 12 cups of black coffee, this is the coffee station for you.  Easy to use & program.  I recommend this product for any of those simple coffee makers out there."
"January 17, 2021",Shawn Johnson,4.0,,After four hours. It shuts off. You can’t heat it up without restarting it. Otherwise a good brewer.
"February 22, 2021",Geraldine,1.0,,Product leaks they wanted me to return then be without a coffee pot. So kept unfortunately!
"July 6, 2018",Sir Salem,5.0,2,"I should be receiving a commission at this point for convincing friends and family to buy this product. For the price, ease of use and features, it earns a five-star review. I wish the inside of the coffee holding area were easier to clean, but that's my only gripe. It constantly brews coffee well, and we've had minimal issues even with the hard water at our home."
"April 28, 2016",cat walker 3,5.0,,My husband & I both love this coffee maker.  The coffee stays hot & it brews quick.  It's so nice not having the glass carafe that either drips as you pour or breaks while washing.  This machine is a superb buy for the money.  I like the brew strength feature that it has & it can also be programmed ahead of time.  I've had Hamilton Beach in the past & they have served me well.  I hope this one does the same.
"October 21, 2019",Camacho,5.0,,Got this as a present for my parents since they absolutely love coffee. My parents have had this for many years now and still works like a charm. Definitely recommend this for coffee lovers.
"November 3, 2020",T. Farris,5.0,,This is our third brew station. Can’t even use the craft style again. Use to break those things so often
"May 22, 2017",Larry J. Moya,5.0,,I like it so far. Bought to use in the RV camper. Bought a remote start generator to go along with it so I don't have to go out and start it manually. Makes coffee pretty fast. It dies make strong coffee and that is how we drink our coffe. So far so good. Can hardly wait for camping.
"December 31, 2019",Genevieve Rathbun,1.0,,"Loved it in the begining, but now it's developed issues, as it brews and warms and reheats condensation forms and drips underneath the holding container and now after just one brew it's full and has to be emptied or it overflows onto the counter. Really good at adjusting strength of coffee. Clean up is quick. At start of brew coffee is potent, once done brewing it's a balanced pot. Reheat option is a little slow."
"November 13, 2015",Rlmkrjj,5.0,One,"My husband leaves early and I get up a few hours after him. We were spending too much on Krupa so switched to a normal carafe coffee machine, however, when I went to get my coffee in the morning it was bitter and old tasting. And we were wasting coffee grinds and money, bc half the time I'd throw almost a whole pot away and make myself a new smaller one. This is amazing and when I go to get my coffee it is hot and tastes great!"
"April 18, 2018",O. Hall,3.0,,"I like this coffee pot in the sense that I don't have a glass container, and it's just one functioning unit. However, I hate that you you have to take the coffee grounds holder out and the holes in that sucker are so big that you end up getting coffee all over your floor on the way to the garbage can. The water reservoir is kind of bulky. I'll use it because I spent the money on it but not a huge fan."
"January 29, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I'm highly disappointed in this product. I just barley purchased this last month, and its not even brewing.  We put the cleaner in, and nothing.  I will be expecting my money back. Save your time and money."
"October 11, 2016",Karen L. Mahon,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker so much. I bought this because I wanted to be able to brew a single cup or enough coffee for company...brewing single cups for a dinner party of 8 was ridiculous. I was replacing a Keurig that was no longer brewing properly after close to 8 years' worth of use and I didn't want to buy another ""k-cup"" machine because of the environmental impact of the cups (I'd been using a little metal cup that is reusable and allows you to add your own coffee to it in my Keurig the past few years). So when I came across the Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Coffee Maker, it seemed ideal to my needs. The machine is dead easy to use and I love the option of brewing ""bold"" coffee. I have only had the coffee maker for a few weeks, so I haven't encountered any of the product shortcomings others have mentioned. That said, at the price, even if it only lasts a few years it will be well worth buying another for me. I couldn't be any happier with this machine."
"July 3, 2021",Nguest,5.0,,Very easy to assemble. Great quality and very easy to use snd clean. Makes a fantastic cup of coffee. Very tasty!!
"August 25, 2017",Believer,3.0,,Works good it's our third one. The unit drips slowly after a couple years of use. There is a rubber washer that stops the flow that wears out an essentially ruins its operation. Too bad the manufacturer doesn't provide for this deficiency.
"December 16, 2020",Cheryl Galan,5.0,,I’ve had this coffee maker for years now and absolutely love it!  I was buying this one to replace my old one which finally wore out.
"May 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,We bought 5 of these coffee maker makers for Christmas presents and all but one leaked coffee everywhere and one would not stop pouring coffee out very dissatisfied with this product
"November 8, 2015",larkflying,5.0,,"Much better than the older version that I had.  It seems more sturdy, works well, doesnt' leak, is easy to clean and fill and does everything a coffee pot should!  Give it a try if you think it might work for you.  I haven't used it yet, but it even has the ability to rewarm coffee if it has cooled off in the carafe too much . . . as well as a setting for iced coffee . .. I used to break the glass pots all the time, and love this kind of coffee maker . . ."
"July 19, 2020",chauncy,2.0,,"I gave this 2 stars because it mostly works as promised. The one HUGE problem is when you use the coffee delivery system ( pressing the cup to a button ) it leaks. It delivers about as much behind the cup as inside of it. Now if this leaking coffee ended up in the reservoir made to catch spills, I'd take the hit, but the way it leaks, all of the coffee ends up under the machine. Cannot reccomend."
"July 16, 2017",Peter Hofmann Jr,3.0,One,This is my 4th version of this coffee maker. I have loved these things for years. Usually around the 3 year mark is when the leaks start from the dispenser seal. Sadly at 7 months in now mine has already started leaking. Outside of this issue which all of mine eventually had these are great. I'll try and contact the warranty line and see how that goes.
"February 4, 2020",Thomas Ryscavage,5.0,,Great coffee brewer. Variable # cups. Control of strength. Easy clean. NO carafe.
"June 15, 2021",William Penname,2.0,,"Coffee started malfunctioning about two months after purchase. Mostly the timer, but eventually the brewing function."
"May 7, 2018",Jack,3.0,,Kept telling me to pour water. Couldn't get it going so this isn't a fair review. Nice item. Love the fact that all you do is put your cup underneath to fill. Really wish i could get it going.
"April 7, 2013",Shampoodle,5.0,,"I read the reviews on this coffee maker ahead of time and like all things not everyone will love the product. However, I liked the concept of no carafe to break or look nasty and I especially like the ability to be able to put my hand into the reservoir and clean it out when necessary, so I went ahead and purchased it. I have had it long enough that the clean light indicator came on today and so I cleaned it as instructed. It was simple however a bit time consuming. I really enjoy my coffee and like a bold flavored cup of coffee which was easily achieved  using no more coffee than my previous coffeepots. I am able to get my travel mug under the spout without tipping it. (It's not a ginormous one but regular size.) No dripping from the spout, And as for the comment about not being able to see when your cup is full use a white or colored cup rather than a black one and you will have no problem. All minor issues that are easily remedied using common sense. Keeps my coffee hot for up to 4 hrs and I love the programmable timer. I'm gonna go have me a cup of coffee now. Hope this helps you decide, and if you go with it I think you will love it."
"January 12, 2021",DeeGee,5.0,,"This replaced an older model that has a slightly different design. So far, it is great - easier to clean and easy to use."
"November 24, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is our second Hamilton beach. We got a lot of years out of the first.
"September 1, 2020",Rod O.,5.0,,This is our fourth purchase of this model. They typically last us about two years. They are easy to program and use and the flavor of the coffee is always excellent. We especially love the absence of a carafe. Just stick your cup under the spout and fill it up. We’ll continue to buy these as long as they’re offered.
"May 18, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,2,"If this unit didn't consume $10.00 in paper towels every month for cleaning up the leaks, it would be a nice machine. Easy to clean, use, and the coffee tastes  good."
"January 11, 2020",Cathy,3.0,,Had to send it back it was broken when it arrived. Didn't replace it.☹️
"June 8, 2021",Mcgowenst,3.0,,It leaks. I got one from the Thrift store and I loved the look and the design… but it leaked. I said heck it all and bought a new one. Sad face. It's a design flaw. The new one leaks just like the one I got for $6.
"July 16, 2016",N. W. Jones,5.0,One,Easy to use and fill with water.  The Delayed Start feature is really simple and works every time.  It is also easy to bypass if you wake up early with a craving for coffee.  The digital read-out is visible from the other side of the kitchen.  So far I have had none of the problems referred to in other reviews.  After a month I am completely satisfied.
"December 23, 2020",roger k,1.0,,"This is my third one. This one leaks coffee from the bottom. I haven't tried to figure it out yet, but very disappointing for this to happen. Maybe I can solve the problem."
"June 3, 2021",Bonnie R.,5.0,,This is a wonderful coffee maker.  We previously owned the same one that was purchased many many years ago.  It lasted so long that we stuck with the same brand and same style again.
"July 25, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,,I got this coffee maker in March and it has already quit working.  I have two cups of coffee each morning and make one big pot of coffee once a week.  I would not say it is over used.  I have not been very please with it from the beginning. It drips and makes a mess.  It is not as easy to put the water in.  I wish they would just bring back the very first Brew Station.  My very favorite design. I had the second one and its OK.  Still working unlike this one. I do think a coffee maker should work longer than 4 months.
"June 24, 2019",Bonbell,3.0,,"Coffee is good. Not as hot as I would like it. I bought it because some reviewers said the coffee was too hot, I strongly disagree! It's a nice concept having no carafe but honestly it's a bit more work and makes more of a mess than the carafe design."
"November 2, 2018",Dee,5.0,,So far works great - finally hot coffee.  I purchased the filter and basket that was suggested - that was a waste of money.  Neither work with this coffee maker.
"September 8, 2014",Ezekiel,4.0,,"I love not having to deal with a carafe, the warming time options and the cold brew setting. It makes a quick 'pot' of coffee!The dispensing lever is stiff and requires you to have to hold the machine in place to use it, especially if you aren't using a tall to-go cup. You definitely have to have both hands free. It could use a light in the dispensing area for the times of day that aren't lit by a lot of natural light, otherwise you've got to turn on your kitchen lights just to see how full the cup is getting."
"June 26, 2019",Delight F.,3.0,,Coffee doesn’t taste great after 2 hours on warm but love the convenience.  Brews as soon as I put water in now without even being on🙄. So much for loving a programmable coffee maker now I have to wait to do it all in the morning
"February 17, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,For some reason it leaks behind the dispensing area. Can't see what the problem is. Very messy. We had one for years and it gave out. Purchased the same one and this one leaks. Threw out box so I didn't return it.
"February 19, 2018",Vivian Hord,5.0,,"Didn't realize I was ordering a coffee pot without pot.  Now that I'm used to it I love it.  Have it programmed and now have hot, fresh coffee every morning and love the cup-at-a-time feature.  Just dont forget to pour the water into the bottom (ask me how I know)."
"November 20, 2016",Elvin,5.0,,This is hands down one of the greatest coffee makers I've ever owned. I at first bought one for my dad but after I broke my old coffee maker I needed a replacement. After him telling me how great his is I went out and ordered one for myself. I love how easy it is to clean this maker and how hassle free it is to make coffee in it. I don't understand the negative reviews!!!!!!
"May 16, 2021",D N.,1.0,,Worst coffee pot ever! Don’t waste your money. Have both the older versions of this and loved them. Bought this one for that reason. This coffee pot leaks every time you pour a cup. Ends up a puddle on the countertop. I will be throwing this one out and going with a completely different brand.
"February 24, 2016",PFranco,3.0,,This is my third Brewstation in six years and it will probably be my last. After two years they begin to leak. I am not 100% thrilled with my latest purchase. After brewing it make a crackling sound that Customer Service says is the heating element. My last two were completely quiet after they were done brewing.I also get a drip or two after it dispenses coffee. I love the idea of no carafe but they still need to make a better product.
"September 9, 2019",Runfast6788,5.0,,I've bought this coffee maker several times. I love that it doesn't have a carafe.
"June 2, 2021",sue welborn,5.0,,Love that there isn't a pot to clean! Makes a great cup of coffee!
"April 18, 2021",Marcos Rangel,1.0,,"I really like the coffee flavor however, everytime we move the coffee pot, we have noticed the coffee leaking and water all over the counter. We thought it was that we weren't putting the cup under all the way but today we noticed a small stream coming from the top of the coffee pot and it continued leaking."
"April 2, 2018",Lauri,5.0,,"I have had this about a month, and so far, it is amazing. I love not having a coffee pot. The programming is simple and there are options for cold brew which sound great although I've yet to try that. It is simple and quick to clean as well."
"January 16, 2020",nicole,1.0,,"We have had our first of this same model replaced (Amazon was great with this) because it stopped brewing mid pot, and we had to turn it on and off, 2-3 times to get a full pot. Well, now it is happening on the replacement! we will never purchase Hamilton beach product again."
"May 13, 2018",Selena,5.0,,I have one so I bought one for my son. We both think this is the best coffee maker I've ever had No glass craft to deal with keeps the coffee hot rinses out easily. Well worth the money an it's really inexpensive I love it
"December 30, 2019",Sam Zacks,3.0,,"This was working perfectly for me and I loved it until it randomly began leaking. I filled each reservoir and identified that it is leaking from where the coffee sits before you dispense it. It is leaking around the heating element. I tried to tighten the screws, but it is still leaking. If I got this basket replaced it would work again, but I don’t know how to go about this."
"May 4, 2021",Redbone 31333,5.0,,Recently bought the new version of this coffee pot.  Repurchased this one no filling up and pouring water to another container on coffee maker. Well not on another one but this one
"June 19, 2020",Joe Campos,3.0,,This is my 5th coffee maker (same model) .  This  one makes a mess while dispersing coffee.  The others worked well.  Maybe just a defect.
"July 2, 2016",Vee Vee,5.0,11,"I bought this brew station 3 years ago and am just now having my first issue. It started leaking from the bottom and from the area where the coffee is dispensed. HOWEVER, this coffee maker has been SO good to us. It was been used every single day if not more than once a day (admitted coffee addict) for 3 years and still gives us hot delicious coffee. I am buying a new one now, but for 3 years of amazing for less than $50 it was well worth it. I recommend this to everyone I know and have had 3 family members buy and love since I've had it."
"May 7, 2020",cmor,1.0,,"Where do I start? First, you have to hold the maker down to keep it from moving while filling your cup. Too small of drip tray. I've had this maker about a month and it has started to stop brewing in the middle of the cycle. I had to shut off and back on 4 times to brew 12 cups."
"March 27, 2017",Nopepon,4.0,,I really like this coffe maker. It has worked great for us and have been using it daily for the last 4 months. My only complaint is that coffee grounds get up onto the lid where the coffe filter sits. It's a pain to clean them off without clogging the holes where the hot water drips from. The option to set how many hours to warm the coffee is nice. Coffee comes out piping hot.
"April 7, 2017",Lea,4.0,One,"This is the second one I have had.  It is better as the other one leaked into the area below the coffee receptical.  It makes coffee, does what is supposed to and I don't have to have a carafe. Only problem was I optioned for the extended warrantee and got nothing to notify me that it was applied.  Only the extra charge. Ripoff on that."
"March 17, 2021",Sarah Betts,1.0,,This is absolutely the worst coffee maker I have ever purchased!!!  The first one didn't work at all.  The replacement leaks every time I make coffee.  I am so tired of it that I am going to throw it away and use a regular coffee maker.  It has stained my hard surface counter tops so much that I don't think it will ever come clean.  Would never buy again!!!
"May 29, 2021",Eva Sparrow,5.0,,Good product always great to work with. Easy to clean. Easy to use.
"February 24, 2021",Christina,5.0,,"I love how this coffee maker looks on my countertop. It's not big and bulky and looks new, nice and clean. The coffee comes out hot and tastes good. It has a nice spout to pour leftover coffee out of. Fairly easy to clean."
"November 6, 2014",Helen Van Pelt,2.0,,"I've had two other brewstations, but this one is not up to HBs usual standards.  We found it more difficult to use due to shape and position of the bar you push your cup against to get coffee.  Just doesn't work well.  Lots of water accumulates inside coffee maker along with quite a bit of condensation.  Seems like a breeding ground for germs.  I complained to Hamilton Beach and they offered to replace with another model of comparable price if I paid shipping.  I did this and am very happy with new model."
"December 12, 2014",Stephen K.,1.0,2,"Im gonna take pleasure in writing this review. THIS PIECE OF CRAP. I bought this liking the idea of pushing cup against the drip spout,or whatever its called. It didnt have a coffee pot. The 1st cup comes out fast and usually hot,but after that,coffee comes out slow and doesnt seem to stay even barely warm. Checked settings and came to a conclusion,which is why I write this review. Its garbage. Dont buy. Look elsewhere and if you do buy and have same problems as I do,dont say I didnt tell you."
"January 4, 2020",MSink,1.0,,The coffee maker stopped working after 7 uses. I filed a warranty claim with Hamilton beach. After 6 weeks and several Facebook complaints they finally responded. In my impatience with their warranty service I took the coffee maker apart and found burnt wires. I sent what I found to them to which they responded that it’s no longer under warranty because I disassembled it.
"January 9, 2019",Monterey Snow,5.0,,"What an easy coffee maker to use, love the temp it keeps the coffee at and so far makes the perfect pot of coffee. The push bar feature is really fantastic, hope it stays leak free and doesn’t clog but so far I LOVE it! Thank you P.S. the only downside is that I feel the drip pan could be larger to set a mug on but it’s not a deal breaker, still a great product!"
"November 13, 2019",Melissa Sickmeier,5.0,,Easy to use Price Delivery Compact No carafe
"July 18, 2019",Prissy,5.0,,Have not used this particular one yet.  Always keep a spare in the closet.  Love these
"February 28, 2015",trwood5115,5.0,,It is the exact same coffee maker that we already have and love--just purchased to have a replacement if the current one ever dies! We love that there is no carafe to break or clean. The coffee tank and filter basket are both dishwasher safe. My husband says the buttons are too close together because he keeps hitting the 'keep warm' button when he turns on the timer. Minor flaw to me as I have no problem with it.
"March 22, 2019",yawnny,1.0,,"Bought this in Dec. of last year.  Is dead. . . . 4 months later!  Just stopped working!  No power, no lights, nothing!"
"October 5, 2020",Ronnie,1.0,,"At first I thought this was pretty cool, boy was I wrong! EVERY TIME I used this And it leak all over the counter and this was daily!!! I had to put a towel under it to save my counter. Just a mess! Wish I could send it back."
"December 21, 2018",Tiffany S.,2.0,,"We were so excited to get this design of coffee maker as we loved the design and the easy clean up! But after 6 months, it would only make a cup of coffee at a time regardless of how much water we put in.  We would have to keep pressing the brew button to brew another cup of coffee.  We tried to look internally to see why this was happening but could not figure it out. Finally, after about a month of doing this, we got frustrated and bought another coffee maker with the glass pot :(  I truly miss when this coffee pot was working."
"August 23, 2020",M Brown,2.0,,"I was really looking forward to getting my new coffee pot.  However, I was so disappointed to find that it leaked coffee all over my beautiful, new quartz countertop.  Hamilton Beach needs to figure this problem out because I noticed that other customers were having trouble with leaks also. Too bad!  I really liked the design of this machine."
"December 31, 2016",anthony,3.0,,"Worked flawless this morning, first time using it.Went to make iced coffee just now and followed instructions. Keep getting POUR WATER message. Have water in reservoir. Then just for the hell of it, tried to make regular coffee and keep getting same message. If anyone can help me I will keep unit, if not it's going back on Monday"
"January 10, 2020",Donna,5.0,,"It's very noisy. After the coffee is brewed, it says to hold the on/off button for 3 seconds to activate the warmer for up to 4 hours. It does not work. You just have to leave it on for as long as you want hot coffee. NOISY!!"
"April 12, 2021",Dorothy,1.0,,Did not like this coffeemaker.  Coffee was hot but leaked when dispensing into cup.  Coffee ran down outside of the coffeemaker.  It must have run back into heating element because it shorted out.  We could smell melting plastic.  Turned off and unplugged.  Tried it the following morning and would not turn on.  Returned for refund.  Worked about 2 weeks.
"August 14, 2020",CCooper1392631,1.0,,"Had for a few weeks and started leaking coffee from bottom as well as from dispenser. Flavor was ok at least but wanted to make coffee, not a mess. Not a good buy."
"June 21, 2020",Robert Rabinowitz,2.0,,"I bought this coffee maker 3 months ago. I used it everyday and loved every cup. Yesterday it started leaking coffee all over the counter. Now it's a hunk of junk. Super disappointed. I would give 1 star, but the 3 months I had it were wonderful. RIP Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Coffee Maker, Programmable BrewStation Dispensing Coffee Machine. You will be missed."
"June 30, 2016",Pat Oakes,5.0,One,"Works great and no carafe to break. No drips. Keeps coffee extra hot without that ""cooked"" or ""scorched"" taste. The coffee is hotter, than a regular coffee maker, like you get at the coffee shop."
"April 21, 2021",Jeremy,1.0,One,Bought this to replace 11 year old same model that was worn out but still worked. ... the new version leaks around the area that the coffee is dispensed from every time a cup is put against it.
"November 21, 2019",Kerry,5.0,,Best coffee maker design EVER! Super easy to use and clean up.
"March 31, 2021",Karen Lang,5.0,,I love it!! I will use no other.  You can get one cup at a time and its easy just put under the spout and push. Easy to clean. Once you try it you will always use one.
"September 21, 2018",Kindle Customer,1.0,One,"This coffee maker was a huge disappointment.  While it is easy to set up and use, it needs some kind of back support such as a wall or lower counter. The steam coming from the back during brewing caused damage to the wall. Now I have to keep a towel under the machine because over the course of a few days it leaks and I have more coffee on the counter than in the pot."
"February 24, 2021",Vincenzo Lopiccola,4.0,,How to fill with water would like an easier way but works fine
"December 25, 2019",TheBusyBee,1.0,,"Coffee didn't get hot enough, replaced with a different Hamilton Beach unit that got the coffee nice and hot."
"October 19, 2016",janis fitch,2.0,One,"This is one of the messiest coffee makers I have ever used, The top assembly requires the coffee basket as well as the coffee reservoir to be removed each time a new batch needs to be brewed. Both pieces drip when removed. Then there is the challenge of refilling the reservoir to dump it into the machine, which seems very inefficient. I was also not happy with the fact that the warmer could not be reset after the auto shut off engaged. The machine will only turn back on after a new batch is brewed. One positive note - it did make tasty coffee."
"January 30, 2020",Kindleのお客様,5.0,,"I got this coffee maker about a month ago and it's been working great. As other reviews say, it does move when you get the coffee. But I put the coffee maker against the wall, that solved the problem. There is no glass pot to worry about breaking, you can remove the water tank to fill, very easy to clean, this is a perfect coffee maker for me."
"June 24, 2017",Kindle Customer,1.0,One,I have had to of theses and after using one for 7 months and one for 1 year they leak for fee all over the counter. Loved it but am going with a different coffee maker due to the coffee leaking all over the cabinet. I have made sure there are no grounds. I get a cup of coffee and it stops when I release the bar but go back and it has filled the holder. Then over night it leaks all over the counters.
"December 25, 2019",Renee Butler,2.0,,Had a crusinant in shopping cart. Bought for my daughter as Christmas gift. Not sure if she liked it cause not what I wanted. Hope it works for her needs
"February 7, 2018",Coralee Lennert,1.0,,"You can never get all the coffee you brewed without take it apart. Why in the world would I not want it straight from the area on the front that it is supposed to come out of and instead take two part off to pour it out of the coffee internal components? The metal piece between the internal carafe and the bottom has essentially burnt coffee liquid. Not even sure how the coffee gets in between those two spots. Huge waste of water and coffee. Option to keep it hot for 4 hours, which i was so excited about, but the coffee is never actually hot. If you want luke warm coffee and only about 2/3 of what you put in it, this is for you!"
"January 31, 2021",Carolyn Thompson,1.0,,I purchased this coffee pot and it drips down the front of the machine and from inside the machine all over the counter top.  Amazon replaced it and the second one drips worse.  The drips are where the front chrome plate attaches to the pot and also from inside the pot.  I cannot use with all the mess.  Purchased a Cuisinart from Amazon and completely satisfied.
"December 20, 2018",A. Stone,5.0,,"This was s replacement machine for a Hamilton Brewststion that we already had.  This is actually our third one and we love them.  The coffeemaker makes three pots of coffee per day and it is easy to use, makes a great cup of coffee and it is nice looking."
"February 23, 2012",Jim Diego,3.0,,"Mine is dead after about 10-months and I'm waiting to hear back about a warranty replacement through HB's web site. Good luck actually getting a live body at Hamilton Beach if you live on the West Coast and don't call in the morning. The older Brewstation models would go for about 2-3 years before they gave up the ghost, but not this model. They seem to die like clockwork at around the one year mark with daily use. See the other reviews about this model. While it worked, my only real complaint was that the thermal carafe would leak wile you were carrying it to the sink to fill up the carafe or dumping the old coffee to start another batch. The ""BOLD"" setting never made any difference in how my coffee tasted, so consider that button non-functional. The only reason I would buy another is due to the thermal carafe feature and the dispensing method of just putting the coffee cup to the front and not having to drag the carafe out and poor. The coffee it made was fine and it would taste good for hours, but if you use the 4-hour keep warm setting the coffee would begin to taste a little bitter if the carafe was anything other than dead full. Overall, I would say this is a disappointment, but I'm also not finding anything better out there at this price point, so I guess I will keep buying HB's disposable coffee maker until I quit drinking coffee. UPDATE Feb 24, 2012: I finally was able to get Hamilton Beach on the phone and after charging my Visa card for $9.95 for shipping and handling of the replacement coffeemaker, I was told to expect my replacement coffeemaker in 1-2 weeks via UPS. In the meantime they want me to send in the severed power cord from my old unit at my expense. Other than the 20-minute hold time to get an agent on the phone the process was relatively painless compared to some other manufacturers."
"December 20, 2018",Jessica Brown,2.0,,"I loved this coffee maker for the first couple of weeks that I owned it. However, it leaks all over my counter and onto the floor every single day now. I have tried making less coffee, but if you are in a hurry and leave ANY coffee in the reservoir, it will leak out, no matter if the machine is on or off. So I will be ordering a different brand."
"July 24, 2018",K. Guy-Verstraete,2.0,,"3rd  purchase of this brand.... first one (years ago) worked great for years the 2nd started leaking all over the counter top and floor, 3rd one in 7 mos of use the program feature has quit working (sorry HB never again) unless you fix the numerous bugs and cheap faulty workmanship."
"October 29, 2019",Mary,5.0,,like that the coffee can be kept warm and that it has no carafe that allows the coffee to evaporate
"April 4, 2021",Rose,5.0,,Love that can make 12 cups of coffee and it will stay hot all morning.  So easy to clean. No pot to break !
"October 28, 2020",Robert M. Ulatt,1.0,,Unit leaked water from the very first time we tried to use it.  We returned it and got a different brand
"July 18, 2013",AL53,5.0,,"I read the reviews before I purchased this coffee maker, and I do not have any of the problems others have described. I don't find the power cord to be too short - we have pretty deep counter tops and I can pull the coffee maker to the edge without a problem. I also fill a tall travel mug at an angle, and do not find that the dispenser drips. I LOVE that this coffee maker has a way to brew iced coffee. I'm not great a pre-planning my coffee brewing, so I always forget to brew it at night and put it in the fridge - I like that hot and iced coffee are options!"
"December 28, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"We've been using this brand and model coffee pot for 15 years, however this one leaked all over out countertop - a complete mess. Not sure what's going on - returned it,received the replacement and the replacement also leaked coffee all over."
"February 21, 2021",Steven Huot,5.0,,Works perfect! Holds plenty and stays plenty warm. Brew on bold for best flavor
"June 25, 2021",GMK,1.0,,"Delivered broken - a lack of qaulity control issue. With that being said, I have owned this model for 10 years and will likely re-order beacuse its the best potless drip machine."
"December 1, 2019",SLR,2.0,,Bought on June 30. By November 1 the reservoir top broke off and the top where the coffee filter goes in broke as well. Not very sturdy...would think twice about buying a Hamilton Beach coffee maker again.
"January 25, 2018",Autumn Raynes,4.0,,"Two bad things I have found about this coffee maker, one is that it has to be up against something a wall, counter, something or when you depress the button to fill your cup the machine slides backwards. The second is the VERY short cord 2 or 3 more inches would have been helpful. Still,I can recommend this coffee maker."
"June 14, 2019",Brandon Wade,5.0,,"I have had this machine for about 2 months now, and it is great. Perfect cup size every time. It has a none machanical push for the pour function. I have even made iced coffee per the instructions. Well worth the money."
"July 11, 2021",Lil Trelfa,2.0,,Coffee does not stay hot and time stopped working after a week
"October 15, 2019",Uncle Skuz,5.0,,Have not had any of the issues people have complained about in the reviews. This product works like it should.
"June 8, 2020",Sharon,5.0,,We have had one of the older models of this for our camper for years and love it.  We bought this one for the lake house and love it even more because it's easier to use and clean than the older model.  We had friends stay with us Memorial Day Weekend and they loved it so much they ordered one right away.
"January 5, 2021",Keely Moss,3.0,,Overall the coffee maker is nice. The draw back and why I would not purchase again is after awhile the coffee dispenses very slow.  I have tried everyway to clean to make it flow better. Would not recommend.
"June 24, 2019",Kara,2.0,,"After brewing, it sounds like the coffee is boiling. I’ve noticed some water leaking behind the machine a couple of times. I thought about returning it but seems like a lot of trouble. I only bought this so we wouldn’t have another glass carafe to break and replace but I think there are better coffee makers out there for the money."
"March 20, 2013",L. Holzwarth,3.0,One,"Filling water and coffee grinds very easy to set up. Pressing coffee fill bar is very easy but the coffee level in the cup can be difficult to see while filling.  It does not brew or keep the coffee as hot as I would like. The single beep alarm when the brew cycle is complete is not enough...would prefer several beeps.  No where was I able to find out how many ounces are considered their ""cup"" size but when we make 10 cups according to the line, I get 2 1/2 mugs full."
"October 6, 2017",E,1.0,One,"Purchased in January. LCD started to fail in February. Started mysteriously leaking water over the summer. Died completely in October. Absolutely not worth the money, and to top it all off, the coffee tasted scorched after about an hour in the reservoir."
"December 15, 2019",Stacy Young,4.0,,I love this coffee maker have had one since they first came out. Don’t have the burnt taste like you do with other coffee makers. Only complaint about this one is due to manufacturing. They didn’t drill out two of the holes in the bottom of unit for the rubber grippers. My husband had to drill them out and remove grippers from the old coffee maker.
"May 19, 2020",Mrs.Wildfire,5.0,,"No more glass pot sitting on a hot plate! I love all the features, bold coffee, iced coffee, removable water tank!! Coffee stays piping hot! Great buy!!"
"November 28, 2020",Tara Heylman,2.0,,"I love that there is no carafe. It’s difficult to find coffee makers without them now. This one does the job of making the coffee, it tastes good, but it leaks when you push your cup for coffee. Drips down from behind the push button."
"February 17, 2017",Billie,4.0,,Just got the coffee maker. I had a older model for years worked so good. So I had to buy a new one. This one is slimmer looks nicer and dose more. My son made ice coffee and liked the way it turned it out. The buttons are easy to use and filling is easy as well good buy
"March 2, 2020",Little Shop of Ora’s,5.0,,"I’ve had many coffee makers throughout my life and I drink a lot of coffee. This is def a great, easy to use coffee maker. No more broken carafes! Coffee stays super hot for up hours."
"May 27, 2014",Dawn Thomas,5.0,,"We absolutely love this coffeemaker.  We love the fact that we can keep it warm for up to four hours without worrying about it and that we can use whatever mug/cup we want for our day (I am a large mug gal).  The only advice I would give is wash the part that holds the coffee often, otherwise the coffee will begin to taste bitter.  I just do it every time instead of just rinsing it out and also do a vinegar clean once a month."
"March 14, 2020",Julie,1.0,,We bought two and both worked well for a while but then would leak coffee from the bottom if the pot wasn’t emptied. Then with the new one it would still seep through a little bit even if it was emptied before it was completely emptied. Don’t waste your money.
"February 10, 2015",THERESA,1.0,2,"I purchased this coffee-maker approximately 2 years ago.  Initially, I really liked this coffee maker without having to deal with a carafe. I realized that my coffee-maker is utilized everyday. After, the first year the coffee-maker started to leak onto my counter and never seem to guarantee a hot cup.  I followed the manufacturers instructions for maintenance on cleaning as directed.  However, the leaking gradually increased after each use therefore, I had to terminate using this appliance."
"January 19, 2016",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I had a previous Hamilton Beach coffee pot and it lasted for years without issue. Bought this model when the previous one stopped working. The water condenses on the lid and leaks into the area underneath the coffee reservoir and needs to be dumped out after ever pot of coffee. I have contacted Hamilton Beach about this and they say that ""there is no remedy for this occurrence"". They are willing to replace the coffee pot but you have to call the customer service line which either 1) has a 2 hour wait to talk to someone or 2) has technical difficulties and are unable to take calls.  Also, there is no convenient way to dump out the water without getting it all over. It makes great coffee but it's not worth the hassle of dealing with the water or trying to deal with the customer service reps."
"October 31, 2020",Juliana,5.0,,An amazing coffee machine defiantly put it in your cart.
"November 4, 2015",Linna,2.0,,"I am very dissappointed in this coffee maker! This is the only kind we buy, and have never had problems..this one makes more noise after coffee is brewed than when it is actually brewing! I let it finish and shut it off, it drives me crazy...a sizzling snapping and crackling sound is what happens after brewed. Really don't trust that it is too safe actually! All done with BREW STATIONS......."
"January 31, 2020",Scott Poe,5.0,,"Wanted a better coffee maker than what we had, but didn't want to break the bank for one. Looked on Amazon and found this unit. Don't have to worry about breaking a glass carafe. Very easy to use and clean. Only wish that it was tall enough to fill a larger mug, but not a big deal. Overall a great coffee maker !"
"June 26, 2020",alice handeguand,1.0,,"I’ve had several Hamilton Beach brew systems but this one is terrible, doesn’t keep the coffee hot,  it takes 35 minutes to brew 6-8 cups!  It’s not the quality and we are very disappointed!!"
"September 9, 2015",John Mc,5.0,,"This is the best coffee maker I have owned. Makes very good coffee and is easy to use and clean. The suction cups on the bottom are the only annoying part. They come loose when moving the machine around on our counter., I had to modify them to reduce their suction but to maintain enough stickiness to prevent the machine from sliding across the counter when pouring a cup."
"January 29, 2021",KC,1.0,,This is a terrible choice of coffee makers. Flawed design leaks coffee when dispensing making the worst possible mess on your counters. Worst purchase I have made on Amazon so far! Also heats coffee until it’s burned inside tasting terrible.
"August 2, 2019",Nancy Nurse,4.0,,This coffee maker works just great! My only complaint is that coffee cup platform is too small & the coffee cup slides off!
"October 23, 2020",bopeeps,2.0,,I liked the convenience of the dispenser but the plastic around the warmer plate seemed to shrink or melt away and now once you make coffee it leaks out of the reservoir into the coffee maker and onto the counter.  The machine was only in use for 3 months and was used once a day.
"September 11, 2017",Eb,5.0,,"What isn't there to love about a coffee pot that starts your coffee before you wake up, and allows you to dispense as much as you need without trying to navigate a scorching hot glass carafe at 6:30 am. Seriously, this coffee pot changes things, and mornings are made that much better. LIFE IS TOO SHORT, YOU NEED THIS, TRUST ME!"
"October 13, 2018",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I bought this to replace our only 2 year old pot.  And it Arrived from UPS damaged, in it's original box!  Coffee maker works amazingly well even though I had to replace it after 2 years due to it leaking.  I can't give it a high star review because the shipping was so bad!"
"June 18, 2020",Pat Lavin,1.0,,"After a little more than 2 1/2 months, this machine stopped working. You would be taking a chance, by purchasing it."
"February 25, 2021",Neenee,5.0,,"Love this product, this is my second one in 20 years.  The only thing that might make it better is a pitcher to put the coffee to serve at the breakfast table."
"August 8, 2016",Yaxman,4.0,,"We had a similar coffee pot in a home we rented in Florida last year, and we really liked that unit. We purchased this one when our coffee maker at home died. We like the design, but we liked the unit we had in Florida better. That unit, also a Hamilton Beach, was a simpler unit. The rubber feet on this unit keep falling off when you slide the unit across the counter. The light is also way too bright, and there is no way to dim the clock."
"September 12, 2016",Arthur F. Shanklin,5.0,One,"Only minor drawback is that it is awkward to pour water from the coffee reservoir into the water heating area. Instead, I now keep a measured pitcher in the coffee cupboard and use it to fill the water heating area. Other than that, LOVE it."
"June 14, 2021",patrick costello,5.0,,Great coffee maker. Especially nice no carafe to break
"July 7, 2018",Joseph Knapp,5.0,,"We love this style of coffee maker and have owned several in the past.  I like this one because you don't have to pour the water into the tank, but you do have to remember to pour out unused coffee when setting up the next pot.  The dispenser pump has a tendency to wear out causing us to replace the entire unit every few years, but I still prefer this type over others."
"January 11, 2016",Rob Alson,2.0,,"I love the idea of a machine without a carafe so I bought this unit just a few days back. However, I am a bit disappointed with it. My main issue is the temperature of the coffee: It does not come out hot enough and I am having to put the cup into the microwave for a few seconds to get the coffee from warm to hot, which is annoying. Anybody else having this issue?"
"August 21, 2014",shinola,2.0,,"We received this same coffeemaker a year ago and although we liked it, it got so it would brew a full 8 cups, quite often the water would stay in the filling reservoir..  Than it got so it wouldn't heat anymore.  Thinking we just got a bad one, we ordered this one a month ago and now we are having trouble with all the water going from the fill reservoir. into the pot for brewing, again.  About ready to give up on this type of pot.  We each have one cup each morning so it is not like it gets overused."
"December 17, 2017",PAPA BUZZ,5.0,,THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS COFFEE MAKER IS THAT THE REFILL IS EASY AND POURING BY THE CUP GIVES YOU HOT COFFEE EVERY TIME. I DO NOT LIKE COFFEE MAKERS THAT  YOU FILL AND THEN POUR INTO MAKER AND MUST LIFT THE POT OUT TO POUR. IF YOU PUT IT ON THE TABLE IT QUICKLY COOLS.  THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE HAD.
"January 10, 2018",Dwight Long,2.0,,"Purchased this coffee maker Sept 2016. Worked great until today. Now the maker will not stay on and the front display flashes ""Add Water:"" Doubt I will try another one, since this one only lasted 4 months. Do like the concept of no coffee pot. May be wise to look at other models."
"March 29, 2016",Step,3.0,,"Lot of condensation, lot of water spillage under normal use. This coffee maker seems to have a permanent puddle around its base in my kitchen unless I go far out of my way to prevent that. Doesn't stay in one place on the counter while dispensing coffee, the force needed to open the lever is enough (for me) to slide the whole machine across the counter."
"July 9, 2018",Ward M.,1.0,,These are normally pretty good.  They usually last a couple of years.  This one is making an electrical buzzing noise after less than 3 months
"November 27, 2011",Barbara,4.0,One,"This will be the third time for this coffee maker.  In other words, it will not be with you for very long.  My last one lasted exactly two years.  Eventually it will leak.  However, I love the features--no carafe, flavor+, 1-4 cups setting.  And, I think it makes excellent coffee and so does everyone who drinks coffee at my house.  So I felt compelled to throw in my two cents worth.  I wish Hamilton Beach would fix this problem that everyone seems to have with it, and until then I will just keep replacing it every few years."
"January 12, 2017",RD,2.0,,"Purchased this coffee maker to replace my old Hamilton Beach Brewstation. I like the brew and serve feature. The big con is the warming plate, it get too hot and burns coffee. The point of the brewstation is the insulated coffee reservoir which requires minimal heat to keep the coffee hot. HB failed on this key feature. My old Brewstation excelled at keeping coffee war."
"August 27, 2019",MNB,5.0,,"Love, love, LOVE this coffee station! This is our second one. The first started leaking when I accidentally popped the filter off. I really thought it was removable, but apparently not."
"June 3, 2016",Sunnysam,5.0,,"OK, so I'm anti-Kuerig. They not only produce lots of waste, and waste a lot of money. And it's kind of sad that most stores only sell those single serving brewers. I want more than just one cup, and I love this machine. This is my 4th one, with each version getting better and better. This keeps your coffee hot for hours, great for guests to help themselves to more. Taste fresh, not burnt even at the four hour mark. So if you love to sip coffee for a relaxing morning turned afternoon, this is for you."
"May 24, 2014",mastiff1winter,1.0,2,"ran clear water through brand new brew station without any problems, yet... when I added ground coffee beans to the  coffee basket for my first brewed coffee, at least half of the water leaked out all over the counter. apparently the machine cannot handle freshly ground coffee beans. I immediately called amazon and they refunded my monies and paid for the return of the brew station, which is wonderful-good, yet I wish the appliance would have worked as advertised."
"July 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,The Best we love it must have you will enjoy it also.
"June 15, 2017",Megan in NC,5.0,,"I have had this item now for about 1.5 years, I believe.  The dispensing of the coffee directly into my mug is great (no carafe to deal with)  You can keep your extra coffee hot for up to 4 hours and I do mean hot!"
"August 15, 2019",HelloKitty,5.0,,"What’s not to like?!? This is the bomb.com seriously. I had a dinosaur of a coffee maker that crapped out on me, so this is down right luxurious. Coffee tastes fresh and is hot."
"October 12, 2015",Buckeye Mike,5.0,,We have had the coffee maker for 1 month.  It is working as advertised and makes great coffee.  I like the design with the water tank for filling on the side with its easy lift handle and the ability to remove the coffee tank for easy cleaning.  Some comments mentioned weak coffee but I have not found this to be a problem at all.  This unit is lighter than older models and does side a bit to the rear when you press on the dispenser so you do need to hold the back of the unit as you fill the cup.
"September 29, 2019",Flavia A,2.0,,"leaks after a year, after two you can barely have a cup of coffee since 60% of a pour goes to the counter. The volume that gets out of it is so little that to fill an 8oz cup could take 2 minutes. for real!!!"
"August 25, 2019",Shane,4.0,,Only thing I don't like is that it's a very light product so you have to hold onto it when dispensing coffee into your cup.
"March 19, 2019",Mrmrsdoinitright,5.0,,"Absolutely the best coffee maker I have EVER owned. Easy fill. Easy brew. Easy pour. Just push, fill and go. Makes large or small amount.  Choice is yours. Excellent product."
"August 8, 2014",zephyrus,5.0,,"We had an older ""Brew Station"" from Hamilton Beach that lasted about 4 years, which was great because we used it daily. The valve on the dispenser finally gave up and so like most appliances today, we tossed the old one on the the trash heap and bought this newer model. This is an improvement over an already quite good coffee maker. There is a ""bold"" setting if you like your coffee a little stronger and the water basin is only used for water (the old one used the same basin for coffee and water). This seems to keep the coffee maker cleaner. For the money, this is a great coffee maker."
"September 19, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Perfect for 1 or 12 cups. Many useful features and no heavy pot to try pouring.
"September 28, 2016",DC WONG,5.0,,"We are enjoying this 12 cup coffee maker. The key is no pot. The unit dispenses coffee as needed, keeps it warm, easier to clean then other coffee makers we have had. Makes a great cup of coffee. Programmable timer, easy to set clock, sharp looking. The base is NOT a hot plate so it doesn't stain and look awful. Would recommend over Mr. Coffee."
"March 1, 2019",JanJT,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. We've had it, in a busy house with four coffee drinkers, for almost a year, and it's worked like a charm. I've had numerous coffee makers in my life, and I love this design. Keeps coffee for all morning without degrading the flavor."
"January 19, 2021",pen,5.0,,Love this coffee maker.  Easy to clean. Easy to use
"January 22, 2019",Pete Pappas,5.0,,The feature I like the most about this coffee maker is the ability for multiple people in the office to dispense coffee into their mugs without handling a coffee pot. This is the second time we have bought this coffee maker. Our first one lasted 8 years with daily use. It's easy to program and easy to clean.
"March 5, 2018",Chad Simpkins,1.0,,"I did quite a bit of research for a new coffee maker. I wanted to get away from K-cups. This model had good reviews as one of the better options out there. It may have been just my maker but I have had nothing but issues with it. The toggle you push to get coffee into your cup kept getting stuck inside the maker. I would fix it but it would get stuck again. This happened over and over again. Today, I started it and walked away while waiting for my coffee to brew. I came back in and coffee was running out all over the counter. Again, it may have been my maker specifically but it is time to move on."
"February 28, 2016",Chad Garlinghouse,4.0,,"We bought this to replace our original Brew Station that we bought 10 years ago.  I like the same hands free feature and new features of the timer and the option to adjust how long to keep it warm.  However, the warming plate is in the center of where you pour in the water.  If you don't pour the water in just right, water goes all over the counter as it comes out the spout in the front.  (So, set it up at night if you aren't very coordinated pre-coffee in the morning!)"
"June 25, 2015",Alexandra Ericsson,4.0,One,"I'm a great fan of this carafe-less coffee maker. I have had the older model for several years, but recently it started leaking from the water tank and the coffee was dispensing in a tiny little stream. It would take several minutes to fill a cup and even after attempting to clean the little screen in the tank, it didn't improve. I was excited to find the new model with a removable tank, as that makes it much easier to fill it. I don't know if others have the same issue, but it looks crooked when placed back. It works fine, just doesn't look right. It is also a bit noisier than the older model, it kind of gurgles, huffs and puffs. It doesn't bother me, but I thought I'd mention it."
"October 21, 2019",Megan W,5.0,,"I bought this coffee maker for my mom for her birthday. Her previous one (left) was just outdated and starting to not work as well.  She did not want one that had a coffee pot so we searched for one that was similar, just newer, to her previous one. She loves the new one (right) and the design of it."
"November 5, 2019",Donna n,4.0,,I enjoy coffee but I cant drink 12 cups straight away and the 4 hour warming lets me enjoy coffee from 6 to like 11 am.  It brews very fast.  Easy to fill unlike the last coffee maker I had the water holding container on this one comes off for ease of filling.
"November 2, 2019",Ladyxray,5.0,,It works nicely. I like the removable side container for adding water without having to take the whole pot apart. It keeps the coffee warm and brews correctly.
"November 20, 2019",Vickie Stephens,5.0,,I had one and it started leaking after a couple of years.  So I replaced it.  I love this brewstation
"November 3, 2017",Fred M. Jeffers,5.0,One,"This is our 2nd one. The first served us well for quite a few years before finally refusing to work. Comparing with other machines, we chose to buy this one again. We like the ease of use and the price"
"May 29, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Leaks after 1 year. They replaced with a new one, leaked again, after 1 year. Would not recommend. Makes a huge mess. Super disappointing."
"July 15, 2021",jimmy trull,5.0,,"i'm happy  since it is a coffee maker, i use it to make coffee"
"April 5, 2021",Angie Weisbecker Prime,5.0,,It will spew coffee out next to where spout is as you are dispensing  (on random occasions) and make a horrible mess as it runs down the back of dispensing wall. So....we have to keep a paper towel at base of it to absorb that or we have a coffee puddle. Other than that (which is awful) it is great.  Lol.
"September 1, 2018",Librarian Daddy,4.0,,"Bought this January 2014, used everyday and worked great. It started intermittently leaking on the side while dispensing coffee so now upgrading to another Hamilton duo coffeemaker. For the price we paid with the Amazon deal back then, more than 4 and a half years was a good run"
"May 30, 2021",Ralph Baldwin,1.0,,It leaked as I had 2 to leak after i brewed coffee
"August 19, 2019",Setser1931,3.0,,Works great replaced my older brewstation with this one. Only problem I'd it boils the coffee the entire time it's on
"January 21, 2019",9XTexan,1.0,,The coffee maker stopped brewing a few months after the one year warranty had expired.  I contacted Hamilton Beach to see if they could assist with the issue and about two and a half weeks later they responded by stating they would give 50% off if I bought another one of their products.  I will never buy another Hamilton Beach product again.  Buyer beware!
"February 14, 2016",Melissa,2.0,One,"Works okay, BUT I thought my husband who always makes the coffee was being messy, but when he got sick and I was making it, I found while it was brewing, a puddle of water built up all around the pot causing damage to countertop. It is too late for us per the return policy to do anything now. I suggest if you buy this watch for the watery mess and return quickly."
"December 27, 2020",Paige Gitter,5.0,,Love love this coffee pot! Glad I could find another one!
"March 21, 2021",William Angus,2.0,,"Coffee maker worked great for about a month,  now stuck on 1-4 cup option. Followed the instructions in manual, unplugged it several times to start from scratch, but can't reprogram it to make 12 cups at one shot. Thought about using a hammer (haha). Got to find another coffee maker that I don't have to sit and supervise to make 12 cups."
"November 25, 2013",gumby4yoga,5.0,,"The coffee maker came fast! I order from Amazon all the time, but this was really fast.  You can pour the coffee before waiting for the whole pot to make.  It does not have the ugly once clear glass retaining bowl. I recently had the Hamilton Beach Brewstation with the side pouring device.  It broke in two and a half months. It is too far removed from the steam to make the whole container.  I like this one far better than the side water dispenser."
"December 30, 2015",Jackie,1.0,4,"It's been 6 months and the machine will no longer brew the coffee hot . Luke warm at best . After it brews I have to heat it in the microwave . The past few weeks it had been brewing it cold then I would wait 10 minutes for the heat plate inside to make it hot , but it doesn't matter how long I wait now it's still cold."
"November 10, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Terrible dribbling past the back of the mug!!!! Will never buy this again
"May 27, 2013",Mr. Fix-it,5.0,,"I bought this latest model after researching previous models, and was glad I did.  A concern that I had was the plastic type used for the tank. The company responded quickly, stating that is was constructed from a proprietary polypropylene polymer,  and I found that polypropylene has no known toxic qualities, so I felt it was safe.  After a few weeks of use, it has performed flawlessly with no issues,  but time will tell.  To save coffee, I use the bold setting with 1/4 less coffee, which works for me."
"September 28, 2013",EA Poe,5.0,2,"My family rented a place at the beach that provided a similar brewstation, and we wanted to order one for home use.  We've been using the Hamilton Beach for a while now, and we think it's great!  Very convenient, and easier to keep clean.  Filling the water reservoir is a little more cumbersome, but it's worth the trouble.  The four-hour keep warm (hot) cycle is just about the right length of time.  We're happy with our purchase."
"March 31, 2019",Papa and Mama Merk,1.0,,I have had 2 of these. Bought 1st and within6 months it started leaking. Hamilton beach wanted to send me a part and not replace. Loved the product so I thought no I will buy one more maybe it’s a fluke. Nope bought it in september and the last 2 weeks the coffee leaks all over my counter when left in. Also the writing comes off the front when you wipe it down. Terrible product will never buy again.
"June 20, 2017",DIY-er,3.0,,"The coffee pot works just fine but the bottom drip tray adds on to the main unit but does not ""clip"" on.  I don't know if this is a default or standard. I have this under a cupboard so every time I pull it out to empty and refill, the drip tray comes off.  Just irritating and an unnecessary hassle."
"June 27, 2011",KNRay,5.0,,"I bought this coffeemaker for myself, but also for my boyfriend who is a total coffee addict. His mom has a similar coffeemaker and he always talked about how he liked the lack of carafe. For someone who drinks ALOT of coffee, having this style maker works like a charm - set it to go off when you need or just turn it on, let it brew, and in a very short time you have a full pot of the good stuff. The best part is the 'keep warm' setting, you can pick how long you want it to stay warm. Keeping the coffee self contained ensures that it does not burn or get bitter from sitting too long. The process to make coffee is a bit labor intensive, however, is not difficult. Some reviews say it is hard to get the water into the base - if you notice, there is a pour spout on the back side to make pouring easier. Take the top coffee part off, fill the base with water, put the coffee part back on and you're good to go. It has never overflowed or backed up, and the coffee comes out strong. (You can adjust brew strength for a customized taste - I'm excited to try the directions for making iced coffee within the pot). My ONLY negative point with this coffeemaker is how large it is... I didn't measure the space between my counter and the bottom of the cabinet, and the coffeemaker is about a half inch too tall to sit back against the wall. We had to put it on our dining table - I got a bamboo mat to set it on - but it works just fine, and makes you feel like you're at a coffee shop, dispensing your fresh beverage. My boyfriend teases that it is ""his baby"" and he's going to take very good care of it... and in fact he does, washing it out and wiping down the outside... I think I'm jealous.  LOL  ;)"
"June 23, 2021",Kaila,5.0,,Lots of coffee options and it makes great coffee
"February 16, 2021",Scott C.,4.0,,This is a good coffee maker. Brews excellent coffee. The drip try doesn't catch all drips which makes a bit of a mess under the machine.
"November 29, 2020",Mrs. S.,2.0,,"Had one of these before, so I was prepared to love it...until it seemed to be leaking from the dispenser spout...and then failed in troubleshooting...and then, on further investigation, was actually leaking from literally every crevice all over my counter. Back it goes,  and I won't risk it again."
"January 19, 2021",PhotoArtist,5.0,,Be sure to have a towel to refill - it makes a good drippy mess!
"March 5, 2016",Greta,4.0,,"We really like this coffee maker.  It gives you great options (4-hour heat, bold coffee, 2-4 cup brew). I was a little apprehensive because of some negative posts, but decided to go ahead with my purchase.  The problem is where the spout is placed, but it's easy to work around. So far, we've not had any spills using our travel mugs. We're just careful. The 4-hour heat feature is really nice.  If we haven't had all the coffee in those 4 hours, we can turn it on again (hold the ON button for 2-3 seconds and it won't beep at you to add water). There is NO burnt coffee!"
"December 26, 2020",Amazon Customer BMK,5.0,,Excellent quality beyond it's price. Exceeded our expectations.
"December 23, 2019",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Had to return it due to the dispensing button getting stuck.the amount of water that is collected on the top of the basket is ridiculous, if you don't try to pour it out of the coffee grounds then you will be dripping water all the way to the trash"
"November 14, 2018",RM,1.0,,I have owned Hamilton Beach in the past with few problems. Within 2 months this coffeemaker began leaking all over my counter with every use. I never write reviews but the customer service was terrible! They said they “thought” it was the tank and I would have to pay to have the tank sent to me! Just get a different brand! I will not be getting Hamilton beach anything again!
"September 30, 2016",Chancellor Ibberson,5.0,,makes a great cup of coffee especially on the bold setting have run about 7 or so pots thru it with no real complaints other than it is a lot slower than what it replaced even on the regular setting  but plan ahead or use the programmer to have it ready when you wake for the time it takes and the great brew it puts out I am happy to wait
"March 2, 2018",rolsen11,5.0,,"This is my second coffee maker like this.  I LOVE that there is no coffee pot.  Just push the lever and coffee dispenses right into your cup or travel mug.  I had my first coffee maker like this for at least 6-7 years.  Easy to program, coffee is piping HOT, easy to clean and just so convenient!!  HIGHLY recommend."
"May 12, 2021",Mario Dinolfo,5.0,,"The coffee flavor cannot be beaten!!  This is our 4th and we are still adjusting to holding our mugs at a different angle with the new design, but are very happy with it."
"June 27, 2021",Diane L. Nuckolls,5.0,,This is the best coffee pot I have ever had it is so easy to operate and makes the best coffee. The design of it is so sleek it looks so good in my kitchen and I just don’t have anything bad to say about it it’s a great great coffee pot. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys coffee
"March 16, 2021",Pamela Seal,5.0,,We are loving this product!!  Our 2nd purchase of this model
"December 4, 2019",Karen,5.0,One,I love this coffee maker.  I had the previous version the attached water reservoir makes it so much easier
"December 21, 2019",Mo55,5.0,,I bought this to replace a previous Hamilton Beach coffee maker that lasted me for a long time. I am just as happy with his one as my old one.
"February 2, 2015",AMDQM,2.0,One,"After years of using a Cuisinart On Demand coffee maker, I opted to purchase this model to save money and try something different.  What a poor choice on my part.  The coffee itself tastes good after it is brewed, but it is lukewarm.  I have to heat it in the microwave after brewing.  It leaks all over the counter, and I'm constantly having to clean it up.  The Cuisinart lasted me for fours years and was used usually twice daily.  The cost is $25.00 more than this much cheaper made appliance that cannot compare.  I have owned this for four months now...thought I should give it a chance, and didn't want to have to spend money to buy another.  I will buy another Cuisinart, however."
"March 11, 2021",Andrea McGrath,2.0,,"Although I like this style of coffeemaker and have purchased it in the past, this particular one leaks all over my counter. It seems to be leaking inside the unit and slowly accumulates underneath. I only purchased this one 6 months ago and  I am looking for a new model"
"September 4, 2014",Constance Lane,4.0,,"This coffee maker has the outstanding ability to maintain freshly brewed coffee at a great temperature with no ""burnt"" flavor.  We adjust the time to keep it hot to 3 hours, since my husband is an early riser, and I'm a sleepy head. I agree that the effort involved to dispense the coffee could be improved.  I just hold onto the back of the coffee maker while I press on the dispenser control.  Not enough of a problem to worry about."
"June 28, 2018",Eric Hyde,5.0,,Easy to use and keep clean - Purchased this after using an older model that was in my place of work for years.
"February 24, 2019",John Gallichio,3.0,,We have probably had 6 to 8 similar Hamilton Beach coffee makers.  In all of these years the design has changed very little.  We always have gotten rid of them because of leaking or electrical problems. This new one leaks down the back wall and the cup as you withdraw it .  After all of these years you woud think they could perfect these simple problems.  Another feature that would be very helpful would be a led light facing down into the cup so you can see the level of the coffee.
"January 11, 2021",Chuck G,2.0,,For 12 cups you can not add enough grounds to make a good strong cup of coffee...the filter will overflow.  Heating element will burn the coffee after awhile..coffee could be hotter.  Wife thinks its easy to clean.
"October 6, 2014",Bec116,2.0,One,I have had this coffee maker for 7 months and up until now have enjoyed it. It's very convenient and easy to use and clean. The negatives are it sounds like it cooking the coffee (percolating) while it's keeping warm in the tank and today I filled the tank at the sink and the water just poured out of the bottom port. This will be returned and replaced with something less convenient unless Hamilton Beach has a fix for it. I'm waiting for a call back.
"February 23, 2021",CDudd,4.0,,Love that the water reservoir is detachable and much easier than prior models to fill. The only issue is that it is SUPER loud when brewing and staying warm.  This is a negative vs prior models
"September 8, 2016",Angel Sepulveda,5.0,One,"I adore this machine. I had something similar before, but after 2 years of constant use, it gave up on me. I have had this one a few months and it has been a life saver for me."
"May 11, 2018",Lola,1.0,,"The coffee is way too weak, even on the bold setting. Tried with unbleached paper filter and a gold tone filter. Very disappointed especially since the coffee is also not hot enough and way to weak. Especially since I use a very good bold coffee product. Will return. 😟"
"June 14, 2021",RaNae C.,1.0,,Everything good except the fact it leaks when pressing handle to pour in cup and leaves coffee on counter under the pot as well. Do not buy!!
"March 27, 2018",Pam Thompson,5.0,,We have these in our 3 rentals and both primary and 2nd homes!  The newer style with side water reservoir is more convenient but this one smaller for use in smaller counter spaces.
"August 6, 2019",S.Karrio,4.0,,It dispenses coffee hot and conveniently. Not quite as tall as my thermal cups so need to keep it near the edge of counter to use.
"July 11, 2017",JanetH.,2.0,One,"Very disappointed! It worked great for the first couple of weeks, however, for no apparent reason the screen has gone haywire. The screen is showing every possible message it can show at the same time but with none of the messages that I set it up with."
"February 10, 2015",Julie Geary,4.0,,This is our second Brewstation. I think our last one brewed awesome for us for about 10 years!! This one makes great coffee on the BOLD setting - we wouldn't use any other setting : ) The only issue we have is that the button you press your coffee against is set in further than our old one and it's so dark under there that we sometimes overflow our cups because we can't see how full the cup is. It would be AWESOME for a little lite under there.
"July 8, 2021",EITJR,5.0,,"Easy to make coffee, easy to get a cup filled"
"August 12, 2019",Beth Cordle,5.0,,We love this coffee maker. My husband says it's easier to use.
"March 20, 2018",Wayne Swanson,5.0,,"This is my second coffee pot of the same make and model. The first one lasted almost 4 years with no issues. It slows down if you don't clean it on a regular basis (I clean mine every other month, and make at least one pot of coffee every day) but what coffee maker won't?"
"September 21, 2019",Kathie,5.0,,Great coffee maker! Does all I need it to & very easy to clean.
"August 26, 2020",Briyanna Robinson,5.0,,Definitely a great buy! I love my coffee maker
"December 15, 2016",Carrie L. Bell,5.0,One,"Been using this coffee maker about a year now and we love it.  Don't always remember to pre-set for morning but that's our bad LOL  Built well, works wonderfully, keeps coffee hotter much longer than the old glass carafe style coffee maker.  Sleek design makes for very little counter space needed.  Worth the price paid."
"July 11, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I loved this coffee maker till it started to leak !! Only had it 5 months and it leaks around the screws that hold the hot plate in reservoir! Very disappointed won’t buy another Hamilton beach  coffee station!
"January 23, 2018",Jill N.,5.0,,Works very well. This is our second of this type and brand. And this one does not let much condensation fill the side areas below the coffee holding bin.
"January 4, 2018",JReyes,5.0,,"Easily programmable, durable over the last year. Doesn't take up too much space, it's easy to load the coffee and water and to program so that coffee is ready when you are. This is our third individual dispensing coffee maker, and for the money, it seems to be the best."
"August 6, 2019",Amanda,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker! I am very pleased with everything all around; especially the iced coffee feature. It keeps the coffee cold, or on the warm brew keeps it warm.  I've had it a few months now and have had no problems at all. This works perfectly!"
"February 22, 2019",DrBob,5.0,,I have had a previous iteration of this coffee maker for years and like it a lot. This one however is not so loveable. Filling the water is difficult due to the frontal shape of the body. I'm a little disappointed.
"May 17, 2021",john,1.0,,"Filled it, went to bed, woke up with water all over the counter for a week sent it back and purchased a different one."
"December 12, 2017",Shirley C.,4.0,,I love the concept of no carafe and it seems to keep the coffee fresher even when kept warmed for 3-4 hours. Second one - I bought this to replace one that finally gave up the ghost.
"July 4, 2015",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is a super coffee maker -- different concept but my husband and I find it makes great brew and we like the convenience of not having a breakable pot to worry about.  The dispensing aspect is cool.  This is our second one-- we dropped a piece on our other one but it was several years old.  This particular unit has the ice-coffee feature and I am using that frequently during this hot summer.
"June 12, 2015",john doe,2.0,,"This is the third one of these that I've purchased for my mother because she loves them so much. However, this is the third one that has leaked. So we've given up and moved on. I would think it was just incredible bad luck except my wife says they have the same problem with another Hamilton Beach machine at her work.  So we've changed or tack and she's  trying a Mr Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 Optimal Brew, very happily so far (since May 2015)."
"July 15, 2018",Russell J Fascenda Jr,5.0,,"I don't even drink coffee but this machine is great.  Convenient design, clock and timer, and dispenser you don't have to wait until the full ""pot"" is brewed.  Makes iced coffee if you load the bucket with ICE before starting the brew."
"March 4, 2020",Debra Witmer,5.0,,"This thing makes the best coffee. And can set it to start brewing for before you have to wake up so it's ready for when you do wake up. ❤️😊 You can set it to bold brew, or 1-4 cups if you don't want to make much, and it even makes iced coffee. And keeps coffee warm for up to 4 hrs after brewed. Easy to dispense too."
"January 4, 2021",John W. Jones,5.0,,"I use the BOLD feature. It gives a robust flavor. I like feature that allows me to adjust how long the pot stays on, from 0-4 hours. The pot also does cold brew which I have not yet done but will in the future. It is so easy to clean. I don't have to worry about breaking the carafe."
"November 15, 2014",John F. Rogers,1.0,6,"I bought this in May 2013. For the last six months, it has been clogging. My wife has cleaned the drain several times, but the coffee just trickles out. It is so frustrating that we are now in the market for new coffee maker and we will avoid Hamilton Beach. At first, we were thrilled with it, but over time, it took longer and longer to pour a cup and now we're done."
"March 3, 2019",Catherine Scott,5.0,,"Works great, it is a slow brew. Easy to use and program. I had to put slip resistant grips on the bottom of the coffee pot because if you put the cup under it to get coffee it would slide across the  counter. But I still love it!!  Made it work.... could very well just be my counter."
"October 2, 2019",Felicia Standel,5.0,,I find this product very easy to use. I love how the Bold really brings out the flavor of the coffee. I recommend this product to my friends and family when they are looking for a new coffee pot.
"May 21, 2021",Matt Toll,3.0,,"We had one of these before it finally started not staying hot and loved it, so we decided to replace it with a second one. Wow what a lemon. It leakes when dispensing the coffee, leaks all over the counter and is just not as good quality as our first one. Really love the concept, but this one is not worth the $40."
"March 9, 2019",S. Westbrook,5.0,,This is the best coffee pot I have ever owned!!!  Love the dispense by the cup and the 4 hour keep warm.
"March 3, 2020",Pat Smith,5.0,,"Love everything about this coffee pot, no glass to clean"
"July 4, 2016",Johnny Mac,5.0,2,Great coffee maker at a great price.  I had a Hamilton Beach brew station in the past and it held up great so I wanted to get another one.  No regrets here.  Brews fast and brews a tasty cup (or 12) of Joe.  Auto shut off after a couple of hours so your coffee doesn't burn.  Can't go wrong with this maker.
"May 28, 2019",Gloria Armstrong,2.0,,The coffee percolator does not perk the amount  you desire.  You to turn it off and on to get the number of cups you desire. I had to buy another percolator.  I don't recommend this coffee station at all.
"April 24, 2021",K.I.,5.0,,"Really like it so far, easy to use and coffee stay hot and fresh."
"November 8, 2020",Dirk,5.0,,Works perfectly and makes very good coffee.
"March 9, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,I rally have a question about the life expectancy of this model...I purchased abput 2 years ago and recently it started to leak from somewhere under the unit. I'm just wondering if 2 years of constant use is what to expect from the maker. I'll probably order another one but I'd like to have my question answered please...thanks
"June 20, 2019",Maryah Kennedy,1.0,,We were so excited to purchase this. But ours will not stop leaking... 5 minutes after it brews the entire counter will be soaking wet. missed the return deadline so wasted the money.
"August 9, 2016",Sunflower,5.0,2,"I love that the water reserve is on the side of the machine! I still have to pull it out from under the cupboard to refill the coffee department, but at least I don't have to pour water into anything. I also like how easy it is to clean."
"December 18, 2020",Janice Cunningham,1.0,,"The dispensing bar has started to jam and has to be pried out after each cup, or I have to take the whole thing apart and put the coffee holder back in to make the bar pop out. Not happy with this and may have to go back to my old, reliable Mr.Coffee."
"May 13, 2019",J Mac,1.0,,"This was our third brew station, this first two lasted about 6 years each, it was time for a new one so we went with this model. Very disappointed with this version, unit leaks coffee after every dispense. Returning and going to give the Keurig a try."
"June 9, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,The Hamilton Beach Coffee system is an excellent coffee brewing system. The best feature is the warming plate that stays on for 4 hours and does not burn the coffee. I also like that there is no carafe and that the coffee is self contained. I gave up on a Kurig Duo to go back to the Hamilton Beach Brewing system.
"January 12, 2014",Gary W. Scott,2.0,,"I bought this wondering if it would work in our small office coffee area.  It doesn't work well in the office so I'm using it at home. The coffee tank and filter holder must be completely removed to add water.  You can't easily add water and make a partial pot if there is still coffee  in the tank.  Too messy for office.  Ok for my home use.  At the office we have used several Cuisinart DCC-2000 type pots successfully over several years, getting about 2 years life per pot,  and I prefer them now for ease of use."
"February 16, 2020",Jerry Heflin,5.0,,We had this model previously and after many years of service we had to replace it.  It is easy to use and ready to dispense a fine brew in no time at all.
"January 5, 2017",Andy,3.0,,"We sent it back. Was a bit taller that the average coffee maker we are used to. Our main complaint was the coffee wasn't hot enough. The plate that keeps the coffee warm after brewing is only about 1""x 3"" big. Not sufficient in my opinion. We returned it for a Cuisinart we found at Costco for $50. That one works great and brews/keeps coffee HOT."
"July 9, 2014",kjam67,2.0,One,"This is my second Brewmaster. The first lasted about 2 years and delivered a hot cup of coffee within a couple of minutes. I purchased this model on Jan 15, 2014 and it is already failing. The coffee maker is very loud from the moment you turn it on (that sputtering sound that usually happens when the coffee is finally done now starts as soon as I turn it on) and it takes over 5 minutes to brew one mug of coffee! The coffeemaker is used once a day for one mug of coffee. I did clean it once since I purchased it and did so according to the directions. I am very disappointed that I have to purchase another coffeemaker so soon. After reading others reviews of customer service and having to pay for a replacement, I decided to not bother and just learn to not purchase from this company again."
"January 20, 2021",William Glassmire,4.0,,Have had similar product in past. This newer model has design that is different from previous ones. Not as easy to use.
"January 15, 2013",Sue,5.0,,"For years I bought cusinart coffee pots... They are more expensive than the Hamilton Beach pots..  The last coffee pot we purchased was a Hamilton Beach Brewstation.... The problem with that model is he front is straight which caused the coffee to  flow over the back of the cup.. The design of this pot  fixes that problem... The front is concaved, therefore allowing  the cup to be directly under the flow of the coffee. It is a great pot at a reasonable price and looks great in my kitchen."
"January 16, 2021",Stacie Cohran,4.0,,I bought this coffee maker in June 2020 when my other coffee carafe cracked. I thought this coffee maker would be better because it didn't have a carafe. This pot leaks when you press the dispense button and the tray does not collect the drippings resulting in a puddle of coffee under your pot. Otherwise this coffee maker worked well for us.
"June 16, 2018",CARINA ATHERTON-CHILDRESS,5.0,,My hubby is now addicted to this machine! He hates experimenting with coffee makers and is nearly impossible to please. He's impressed and happy with this!
"July 7, 2019",Kevin C,4.0,,"A lot of parts to make a pot of coffee, fill one bin to measure, then poor into pot, then place basket in top part to brew. Easy to clean however and keeps coffee hot for four hours"
"April 5, 2021",pat braden,5.0,,Best coffee maker I have ever owned. Makes great coffee.
"December 13, 2019",Kindle Customer,2.0,,Did not keep the coffee hot.  Returned it.
"July 12, 2021",joyce,5.0,,Love the new upgrades on this coffee maker
"December 13, 2018",Nathan,5.0,,"This thing is great, we use it every morning.  Easy to use and clean!"
"January 26, 2017",Jennifer Stevens,5.0,One,Had for 2 weeks and no regrets.  I like some of the features on this one. It has a 4hour stay in time which is great for my family we get up from 4:30 to 6 and I can still have a cup hot and ready at 8:30. It has a hold setting for stronger coffee and it's easy to clean. I would buy this again.
"June 24, 2020",J.L.,1.0,,"My husband liked the coffee brewer, but all 5 we purchased broke soon after we began use.  One actually made it to 1 year (just past warranty).  We notified Hamilton Beach and received at least one replacement from Amazon.  We finally got the message and changed brands.  I do not recommend purchase of this item."
"January 3, 2017",James Francisco,3.0,,"Coffee maker good points: No carafe, easy to set up and brew. Bad points:  Brewing temperature is not hot. To brew great coffee you need good beans and HOT water to release the full flavor of the beans. This coffee pot doesn't get very hot. If you like warm coffee, then buy it. If you like full flavor and hot coffee, then keep looking."
"June 2, 2021",DiLa Jacklee,4.0,,I liked that you could use k cups or ground coffee with it. Doesn't take up much space on the counter.
"July 7, 2020",DR,1.0,,"Purchased on 3/30/20. Release bar broken. HB support unavailable by phone and email function on support page not working. Worked yesterday, broken this am after brewing coffee."
"May 22, 2020",Bridget McGuire,1.0,,Bought this product in January 2020 to replace a coffee maker that was over 8 yrs old. Today the reservoir tank cracked spilling fluid all over my kitchen counter. Searching online and there is no available option to purchase a replacement reservoir tank. Unless replaced by the company this product is nothing more than a waste of money.
"September 24, 2020",Roxann Welker,5.0,,"love this coffee maker, best one I found"
"December 30, 2020",tim glasscock,1.0,,"Right out of the box it leaked coffee out of the dispenser when You try to get a cup of coffee. It makes good coffee but most of it ends up staining Your counter. I expected better from Hamilton Beach. Should have gotten the other model We used for 6 years and finally started to leak, not right out of the box."
"April 21, 2019",CJ,5.0,,This is my 4th coffee maker like this. I even had one sent to my parents. Love that it doesn’t have a pot to break or clean. So easy to use. Been using these for many years. Very reasonably priced!
"July 11, 2013",WildWomanOnAHorse,4.0,,"Because I have this pushed back in a corner of my counter (to keep it from sliding when you press the dispenser) you can't see in the cup to see how much coffee is in it until it's almost too full, and too full to add much cream. I wish when you pressed the dispenser a little led light came on so you could see how much coffee was in your cup. Other than that, it took a couple of days to get the feel of the maker, how much water to how much coffee grinds, etc. But I'm happy to be carafe free!"
"September 7, 2016",Jules Carlson,5.0,One,"When I was looking for a new coffee maker, I had a low budget to work with. I read a review as I was looking at this one and that's what sold me. Got the product in time and well packaged. Set it up, with little confusion and enjoyed a great cup of coffee ten minutes later! This is a great coffee maker for it's price, we love it!"
"August 20, 2017",Lena,5.0,,I actually thought this was a regular drip coffee machine with a glass pot and everything (I wasn't paying attention when I bought it and based my purchase off of the reviews!) but I was really happy when I got this product.  It's super easy and I definitely recommend this coffee maker.
"April 7, 2015",Terri A Euber,5.0,,"We had an older model of this coffee maker for quite a few years.We finally decided to upgrade to the newer model. It is the best coffee maker we have ever had ,( including the Keurig!) Love that it's programmable,the older model wasn't, and the coffee tastes excellent! I love that there's no carafe to deal with and its easy to clean! With Keurig, the coffee k cups are expensive and not biodegradable.We found that we didn't like that.This is the best coffee maker we have ever had!!! Love it!!!"
"March 22, 2016",kwef,5.0,,"My husband and I were sick of spending so much money on the k-cups. We decided on this coffee maker and we are very happy with our purchase. We haven't had issues with it spilling when we are pouring the coffee. I love the timer feature, it is so helpful for those early mornings! We set it for the morning and put on the keep warm for four hours option.My husband has to wake up about 2 hours before me and we both have coffee waiting for us when we get up.I'd definitely recommend this"
"July 4, 2018",Catherine A. Jurisic,5.0,,"This is perfect for my morning coffee.  People have complained about leakage but I've noticed if you pay attention to where the lip of your mug or go cup is hitting, you can make sure you are pouring the coffee into your cup and not leaking around the edges."
"January 4, 2016",Serious Taurus,5.0,,"I am very happy with this purchase.  My first experience with this coffee maker was at a rental home in Florida, and I liked the idea of not having a carafe that can break.  We make our coffee in the morning, the coffee maker keeps it warm for the number of hours I set it, and with my arthritis, I do not have to hold a heavy pot of coffee to pour out; rather, just place my cup up to the spout to pour out."
"July 16, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Great coffee pot. Easy to use and clean.
"March 16, 2014",MOMDistracted,4.0,,Almost perfect. Which is why it gets 4 stars.  I love the dispensing feature like the last one we owned but this one is soooo loud even after its brewed.  I put a piece of foil on the heating element as someone else suggested and that has helped a bit.  Going to try the other suggestion ofusing weld if I can find some here in germany. Other than that and the fact that they switched the dang buttons on me (program now on the left and on/off on the right) I love it!
"January 22, 2016",DC,5.0,,"I love the ease of dispensing a cup of coffee, very fancy. I have had absolutely no problem with it. You have an option of making a regular cup of coffee or a bold. Up to 4 hours of heating time and you can also set it too warm. My only complaint is filling with water. It's a little awkward for us vertically challenged people and I usually end up spilling some water on the counter. Might help if the spout was a little wider."
"November 1, 2015",C. STONE,2.0,,"First, the description states that it does not have a carafe and it does not have a traditional carafe but it does have one. It is right above the clock, it is part of the coffee maker. In order to put water in it you have to remove the filter holder and the carafe, basically the top half of the machine. This brings me to the biggest problem with this concept, you have dismantle the machine to put water in it. So if you are like my wife, when she wanted a little more coffee she would just add a little more water into our old coffee maker with a glass. With this one you take all the pieces off put a little water in it and put it back together. The only plus is you do not have to lift a carafe (pot) to pour coffee."
"July 7, 2019",Dale and Kristy Guthrie,5.0,,"My daughter had one of these, and I loved it. So when I needed a ne coffee pot I bought one."
"September 24, 2018",Lucy P,5.0,One,Love this coffee maker for our motor home/RV after 3 attempts on other coffee pots this was by far the best choice! Put a non skid pad under and we leave it on the counter during travel! Keeps coffee hot and it is super easy to use and clean!
"April 6, 2017",Dawson,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker and the design. Won't fit under countertops, fyi, since the top needs to open to get the basket out. Keeps coffee warm without burning, easy setup, easy clean. Love the design of pouring from a spout instead of a carafe, makes for easy refills when you've got full hands."
"July 3, 2017",jean v,5.0,One,LOve this coffee maker. Second one I have purchased. Keeps coffee hot in side container.
"January 27, 2021",Kaley H,5.0,,Gift for my mothers birthday - she LOVES it!
"June 24, 2020",Susan Cipriani,1.0,,"Within two days the lid covering the water container broke.  Three weeks later, I came down to my coffee all over the counter.  We thought it was something we did to cause this.  The next day the same thing happened.  We just ran water through it to see what was happening and there was a crack in the contain that holds the coffee.  I had to return it."
"July 10, 2018",Susan Powell,5.0,,"I had my last Hamilton beach , with the tank on the side ,for at least 3 years when it started leaking , it brewed excellent coffee though so I wanted to stick with the single serve type and so far I’m very pleased with this type , I’d be very surprised if this one ever leaks"
"March 2, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I have been a Hamilton Beach fan for some time now but am very disappointed with this product. It came with no rubber feet and slides all over the place when trying to fill a cup, but the worst part of this product is the design that allows condensation to run onto the warming plate. It won't stop sizzling, it is the noisiest coffee maker I have ever had. It sounds like it is still trying to percolate, very annoying. Looks like this one is going back."
"February 20, 2018",BananaMcGee,5.0,,"This was a replacement gift for my daughter, as her coffee maker had died. They are so pleased! It keeps coffee hot without the old taste one gets when it sits on a warmer plate. The dispenser function is great, and the coffee flavor is superb!"
"February 9, 2017",MissWen,5.0,,"So happy with this coffee maker! I've had it for a few months now and have had zero problems. Not having a coffee pot to have to wash and look at is wonderful! I've had no problems with cup size fitting, dripping or anything of the like. Easy to clean. I hightly recommend."
"October 15, 2019",maria,5.0,,I have used this type of Hamilton beach coffee maker for several years.  I think this may be the 3rd. one I purchased.  As long as it is kept clean it will serve you well.
"November 7, 2017",Lauren,5.0,,"Simply the best coffee maker we've ever owned.  It brews coffee quickly, and boldly. Everyone who uses it, usually says the same thing ""What a great idea""! And it is.  Coffee is brewed HOT and stays hot for up tp 4 hours depending on what you choose.  Easy to load, easy to fill a cup, easy to clean."
"June 4, 2014",Samantha Joy,5.0,,"I've owned this for five months and used it nearly daily. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and makes good coffee. I've seen complaints on other reviews that the lever that releases coffee is too far back, which makes it difficult to use with thick sided cups, but that is not my experience. I regularly dispense coffee into double walled insulated mugs without a problem. I also love the fact that there's not a carafe to shatter on my kitchen floor."
"July 4, 2021",Xavier Meyer,3.0,,Don't know if it was me out my grinding settings or my beans or the maker but I could not get coffee on this machine. The form factor is nifty
"April 24, 2021",June Clark,3.0,,I loved this coffee pot my first one lasted 7 years. But the new one only lasted 1 month. Then quit working. So I would not recommend this pot anymore.
"February 11, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"My review does not show up online.  Please advise. I love this coffee pot and have purchased several in the past.  I replace them every couple of years just because they get grimy in places that I can't easily clean.  But, for the second time the top of the removable water reservoir has broken.  Is there a place to buy just this part?  Or, if someone wants to sell me theirs (if they are no longer using it) that would be great.  I'll watch for a response.  Thanks!"
"November 5, 2016",Sunshine71,4.0,,"Really like the fact this Coffee Maker has no carafe.  It makes great coffee & is easy to use.  Brewing seems slower than our Mr. Coffee, yet I can easily fill a cup during the brewing cycle with no mess.  Coffee stays hot in the unit, though once in the cup, seems to cool off more quickly, so I've switched to using mugs.  Plenty of room to fill my travel mug, too!."
"February 6, 2021",karen,5.0,,you have to take it apart to put water in it
"June 23, 2015",Sandy,5.0,,This is my third brew station.  I had two of the original versions with the water dispenser that you had to fill in the unit - unlike some customers I had no problem with it .  Now that I have moved and have a larger kitchen with more counter space I went for the new version of the brew station I love the side fill tank -just like the Kureig It works so well and I really love it !
"February 7, 2021",Judy Ashley,2.0,,"Not happy for my very first order, parts are not fitted tight, leaks on bottom of pot and when filling my cup it also leaks. The coffe is hot hot (which is great) but pices don’t line up with each other therefore leaks every time disappoints."
"April 15, 2012",Joshua,4.0,,"This thing is amazing. I have had it for weeks and it blows away any standard coffee pot.  I was a little worried about the cup holder and button you press in with the cup, but it turns out it is VERY solid and I can fit nearly any size cup in it to get coffee. Even those large long mugs. Even though this coffee pot keeps every cup fresh, even 4 hours later, it has one and only one major flaw in it. It shuts itself off after 4 hours. That is the max you can put it at. I know this will not be a big deal to some, but when that one pot can hold 12 cups of coffee and each cup tastes fresh, it gets annoying when the light shuts off after 4 hours and the rest of the pot is wasted. You have to press the ""on"" button again, put some more water in it, just to keep it on. (or just make a whole new pot) There is no way around this it seems. 4 hours is the max. ""So drink up, or get out"" is its logo. Of coarse.. this sure is a step forward than the old (2) hour model. -.- Also, I noticed that you can hold the main section by the handle after you fill it up with water. The water pours out of it very nicely. But if you actually hold it by the handle and only the handle, watter will pour backward from the opposite side and all over your arm or floor. They need to put the handle more tword the middle so it does not lop side backward."
"December 7, 2020",Stephens Espiritu,2.0,,"I've have had 2 Hamilton Beach units that had no leaks and very disappointed in this one, but giving it a bit more time before I decide to return and get another brand and forget Hamilton Beach products."
"January 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Bought this to replace our old one. This is such a great coffee maker. Nice to just hold your coffee cup up to the dispenser.
"August 31, 2020",Toni Jones,1.0,,"Purchased this in May '20 and it is the messiest coffee maker I have ever had. Leaks underneath creating a stain on my countertop daily and immediately upon  filling your cup, if you set coffee cup on counter, it leaves a ring of coffee under your cup. Apparently my return window was only one month and I'm left with a $60 coffee maker that makes a daily mess."
"April 24, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"This is our 3rd of this same coffee maker.  Our last one got damaged in a fall in our camper.  It still worked, just the dispenser button lost the spring in the back so we had to lift off the reservoir to pour the coffee out, which you aren't actually supposed to do but it worked.  So I finally got a new one and it's great.  Coffee stays very hot.  I contemplated getting a more expensive brand, but in the end couldn't justify over $150 when this one works great.  A great coffee maker and value for the money."
"July 1, 2019",A. Konopka,3.0,,"Other reviewers said this was noisy and I agree, it makes an almost constant hissing noise but the unit is much improved over previous models with its side mounted water tank. However, after only 4 months use the coffee reservoir leaks all day on my counter if I forget to empty it - makes a big mess. Will not buy this type of coffee maker again."
"January 5, 2020",Priscila,5.0,,Awesome coffee machine! Consistent brew each time. Easy to clean. Easy to set for auto brew. Very happy. I recommend getting the reusable filter to make it even easier!
"April 6, 2019",James B.,1.0,,I got this item for my mom and it broke 9 to 6 months later
"July 5, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"This brew station leaks from the bottom and it’s  hard to pour the water in without spilling it.  It works fine and coffee is good, but I would not recommend to buy because I’m always wiping up water or coffee from it."
"August 28, 2014",Shortcake,5.0,,"Though my coffeepot was reconditioned, it looked like new on arrival.  I have had it like 6 months now, and I love it.  It still works great, makes a wonderful cup of coffee, and I love the dispenser....very convenient.  You can choose to keep your coffee warm for 1-4 hours, and I haven't had an issue with it tasting strong or scorched as I have with other pots when not drinking the coffee immediately.  The clock/timer feature is also very handy if you want to get everything ready the night before and have your coffee ready whenever you get up in the morning."
"February 15, 2021",Rabiddogg,4.0,,Hamilton Beach always makes a good coffee maker and this is no exception.  This is the third internal storage style maker I have bought from them in 20 years and thus far this one is the best.
"November 8, 2019",N Roeder,5.0,,"I love this coffeemaker.  It is sleek, spacesaving , well made.  It keeps the coffee piping hot, and is easy to set up and operate.  Love that it is not a traditional coffeepot.  The reservoir keeps the coffee hot, but does not ""overcook"" it."
"December 20, 2017",Jennifer,1.0,One,"We had the older model for years, this one never worked correctly. After the first use the water tank only empties a little over half even though it is clean. It's just over a year old and has only been used about a dozen times as its easier to use the Keurig. I didn't realize it has a warranty until it expired."
"August 5, 2018",Ricky G Matli,3.0,,Updated design and still water EVERYWHERE when you open machine or even try to make coffee. You open the top to start a new pot and sploosh water goes everywhere. it keeps the coffee hot but you better set it on a towel unless you like wet counters.
"December 1, 2020",Debra Savage,1.0,,I bought this because my last one leaked all the time and this one was even worse!! I threw it out in less than a month.
"February 19, 2020",James Prine,3.0,,I like the product it's ez to use and clean ect. Just after some time  The valve that the coffee comes out of will leak after 6 to 9 months.
"September 22, 2019",Sue F,3.0,,"I haven't tried this coffee maker yet.  I ordered it as a gift and i am very disappointed in the way it arrived.  It was not in a protective box, just the original manufacturer box.  The box looks like it was ran over multiple times!  I cannot gift this item!  I unpacked it, and it appears to be ok.  But ican not gift a smashed box!!"
"April 1, 2021",Pyle,1.0,,Only had a couple of days. Leaking coffee from the bottom.
"November 10, 2020",Tomjohnson,5.0,,Been using this brand and style for years. Never had a problem with them. Just upgraded.
"March 23, 2018",Steven Rosenblum,5.0,,I've had a couple of versions of this coffee maker and this is the best. Having the reservoir on the side makes it much easier to keep clean and to setup.
"March 9, 2021",Evilution,3.0,,Works great but leaks with every dispense.
"November 16, 2020",Rick,5.0,,"Leaked, burnt coffee with 3 cups left in it"
"August 11, 2020",Jonathan L.,5.0,,Replaced my old brew station of 15 years.  Last one started to leak.  Love that we don't have to clean a carafe.  Perfect design. Quality product.
"May 9, 2021",Deanna Elkins,2.0,,"I wanted this coffee maker to work so bad but from the first day it has leaked every single time I’ve used it. I have tried altering the amount of coffee grounds, water, I even get the coffee in my cup before it fills up too much. I don’t know what the problem is but I am so disappointed."
"November 20, 2020",Mouse,1.0,,I had another of these a few years ago and it just gave out after a couple years so thought I would try it again.  The brew cycle on this would never shut off.  I threw it away.  Afraid of electrical problems.  Should have returned it but sometimes you just get frustrated.
"May 3, 2019",Laura Kinnett,3.0,One,"It’s awkward pouring in the water to fill up and between that dripping and making a mess, when you lift top to fill and put  in coffee grounds, water drips everywhere. I set it the night before to brew when I’m waking, which I love!"
"January 10, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"2 of the 4 rubber pieces on the bottom of the coffee maker were not there, so when you push the lever to get coffee, the machine slides.  The top that opens for the water is very flimsy, the plastic piece on one side keeps coming out every time you open it to pour the water in."
"July 11, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,I love this coffeemaker! It don't make a big mess. Also this will fill any coffee cups so far that i have tried under it.
"November 30, 2020",melinda mcguire,4.0,,"This coffee maker sucks! I ended up with coffee all over my cabinet, then it ran down my dishwasher,  even all over the control panel and stained it. I'm really disappointed with Hamilton Beach. They used to have quality products....this one is the cheapest made POS I'beaver owned."
"December 1, 2018",cherylck,1.0,,"I really liked the reservoir and how well the coffee was brewed. I hated having to clean up my counter almost every using it for the past month and a half. Even when I think I emptied the reservoir, some coffee manages to flood my counter."
"December 29, 2020",JGP,5.0,,Love this coffee maker. Good job Hamilton Beach!
"December 8, 2020",Curtis B.,3.0,,"This coffee pot makes great coffee, but while keeping it warm we can hear the coffee boiling.  Appears that the thermostat is set to high to keep the coffee warm.  This is very concerning and we are afraid to leave it on without watching it.."
"June 3, 2021",Margaret Weiss,5.0,,I really like this coffee maker.  This is my second one and the first I had for seven years with no problem.
"February 4, 2018",Amie Kienzle,2.0,,I have had this for about a 1 1/2 yrs. It is really hard to clean. Where the brewed coffee sits there is a spot where the heating element burns the coffee. Also the pour spout has a little filter that cannot be removed and is nearly impossible to actually clean and the coffee comes out very slowly. The seal on the pour spout is failing now and it drips leaving a huge mess on the counter throughout the day if we don't empty the pot right away.
"January 4, 2021",Patricia austin,4.0,,The only thing that concerns me is the the warmth function.  This brewmaster makes noises when in the keep warm mode like it is still brewing.  Our other brewmasters never did that.  You have to be careful refilling your cup because the pot is very hot.  I am considering notifying the company about this
"February 18, 2016",The Lyttle Yellow House,5.0,,"I will never go back to a standard drip coffeemaker. I thought I loved my Zojirushi until trying the Brewstation. I purchased this to make a coffee station upstairs since it is nice to relax upstairs for a while, and the kitchen is quite a trek first thing in the morning. Now, I am anxiously awaiting the demise of my downstairs coffee maker so that I can switch to a Brewstation there as well."
"December 10, 2019",Lynn Kochanski,3.0,,"For some reason, the internal warming unit boils the coffee inside. We had to turn off the coffee maker after the brewing cycle to prevent boiling. Then, microwave each cup of coffee afterward. My son has this coffee maker, and I love the ease of use, but he has the same issue with the coffee boiling. Too bad. Had to return."
"September 3, 2020",Renee,5.0,,It’s easy to use an brews great coffee
"November 23, 2018",Elliot W. Anderson,2.0,One,"I agree with the reviewer who said the drip decreases...decreases...decreases.  It also leaks all over the place.  There’s a filter that can’t be removed over the hole the coffee drips from...and I believe that may be the problem. Ive scrubbed it and cleaned the machine, it gets a little better... but then it decreases...decreases....decreases.  I’ve had it for two years and I now have to buy a new maker.  It still works, but it makes a mess everywhere."
"January 12, 2013",Mindy,5.0,,"We LOVE our HB Brewstation.  We bought one six years ago and loved that one but I dropped the reservoir a few weeks back and cracked it.  It was not leaking but I was afraid that it would eventually leak.  I looked for one at our local department stores but could not find this style with the stainless panel behind the dispenser - I wanted the stainless look - so we just went to good ole AMAZON.com and ordered the one we wanted - and by the way, the price was very reasonable.  Well we got our new one in this week and WE LOVE IT!!  They have improved something we already loved.  It is taller so a larger cup can be used to dispense coffee.  The clock is backlit with a blue light and our old display was difficult to read.  it has a 1 to 4 hour option of how long to keep warm - AWESOME!!  Our old one had a 2 hour option only.  It beeps once when the pot is done - our old one did not.  AND most importantly - it makes GREAT coffee.  I just hope this one lasts as long as our last one!!"
"December 20, 2012",Tish Anne,5.0,One,"First things first-Amazon shipped this sooo fast! Had it in 2 days-in Alaska (amazing!) This is a great coffee maker. I was a little worried upon reading reviews about cups being too wide- I have real mugs, handmade with very thick ropes of clay wrapped on top of eachother to make up the cup & I've had no problem. I've also had no problem with bigger mugs that flare out at the top. I guess those reviews might be user error? Makes coffee quick, hot & I can pick the brew strength. The ""carafe"" part that holds the coffee until it's served even doubles as a water pitcher-genius! Buy this, you won't regret it"
"May 27, 2019",Suzy Cooke,1.0,,"Overall it was a decent coffee maker. BUT, it is now leaking, the reservoir drained onto our counter and then to the floor. We purchased in March 2018, and this just happened Memorial Day weekend 2019. 15 months....I've had Mr. Coffee pots last way longer."
"May 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Bought to replace first one love it
"December 29, 2013",sharonb,5.0,,I like the fact it has a removable water source comes off the machine and an be filled at the sink faucet. I have limited movement in my shoulder and have been unable to fill the previous coffee pot. Makes good hot coffee when this coffee maker was delivered we found that 2 of the 4 rubber stoppers to keep the pot from sliding on the counter were missing. Lucky for me we had not thrown the coffee maker (same model) away and my husband is very handy and can fix it
"May 18, 2021",Lashes,2.0,,Works but leaks when filling cup.
"February 3, 2019",Lori,5.0,,Best coffee maker with out a carafe. Love the way it holds my coffee. I used to break every carafe I had. Now I don’t because it holds my coffee until I’m ready for it. I put it in in my cup and warm it up.
"February 23, 2021",Rafael,1.0,,I would not recommend! I’ve had this coffee maker for about 1 month and it burns the coffee quick about 30 min and that’s as fresh as it’s gonna get it literally boils the coffee while inside and the metal “plate” inside the coffee “pot” stains with burned coffee
"November 22, 2018",Melindahascats,1.0,,"I like the style slot. However, after a year and 7 months, it has quit working. We checked power, unplugged and so on. The previous Hamilton Beach died after about that amount of time so I think I'll have to go to a different manufacturer."
"March 9, 2021",Joan Hendrickson,5.0,,I have loved this coffee pot for years! I also have one at my lake cottage! Mine started to leak after 5 years so I always buy a spare in case they stop making it!!!
"November 28, 2018",Carol E.,1.0,One,"Didn't own this for a full 3 months and it just totally quit.  I cleaned it twice and had no issues, until yesterday.  Like there is no power to it at all.  I tried plugging and unplugging to no avail."
"July 28, 2017",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"We loved our old Brew Station that lasted for years. Hoping for a similar experience in the newer version, we ordered this one. It makes coffee fine, however it is flimsy and cheaply designed. I will be surprised if this thing lasts 12 months. The rubber pads on the bottom don't stay on, the water reservoir does not have a good solid fit in the brewer and it makes all kind of noise after brewing while keeping the coffee warm. These are all things that were not present in our old model."
"May 7, 2020",Cb5628,5.0,,Love this coffee maker. Makes making coffee simpler.
"November 12, 2019",Lorraine Jurado,5.0,,"Could not be easier to use, keeps coffee piping hot for hours. So glad there’s no fragile pot to crack or break."
"December 28, 2020",Pete H. Lucero Jr.,5.0,,"This is perfect, no messing with a carafe, perfect size for travel tumblers, easy to take apart & clean.  I was so impressed I bought my sister one for Christmas.!!"
"March 25, 2021",Melissa pence,2.0,,It leaks when poring a cup of coffee. It’s very messy. I spend  a lot of time cleaning after we are done with the coffee in the morning
"October 3, 2015",Steve P S,4.0,,"I got this on the recommendation of a friend, in spite of some negative reviews about leaking. So far, so good!  What I like the most is the ability to have fresh tasting, hot coffee in any increment for several hours, unlike the Keurig I am replacing. It's a bit bulky for the space I have, but that is the only negative.  Also, the price is very reasonable for the features. which include the programming so that coffee is ready when I get up."
"March 20, 2016",Tooker,3.0,,"ok after owning this for 2 years,  can update my reviews. from 5 to 3 stars because the dispenser barely allows coffee to drip in a steady flow (yes we do the vinegar/water cleanse on a regular basis & thoroughly clean the machine). Im thinking of going back to a craft style unit or possibly the Cuisinart DCC-3000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker."
"May 30, 2016",Anna,1.0,4,"I bought this coffee maker after my second Mr. Coffee failed after a little over a year of use.  I figured I needed to try a different brand and this one had such amazing reviews with well over 2000 of them. At first, I loved it.. no carafe to worry about, everything internal, quiet, coffee is VERY hot.  However, the longer I have had it, the more I have come to dislike it. First, there is an incredible amount of condensation inside.  To open the lid, or remove the internal carafe, or attempt to refill the coffee maker is going to result in water getting everywhere.  I frequently open the lid to allow the inside to dry out, but still.. On the same note, refilling the coffee maker is a pain in the butt.  You have to dismantle the whole thing, you need to have some place to set the grounds basket. And they are dead serious about the 12 Cup Max warning on the inside.. if you go over that mark, water will run out of the back of the coffee maker all over the floor. For the price I thought I could deal with all of that, and was making so.. however, over the last couple of days, this coffee maker has finally defeated me.  The flavor of the coffee has gone from good to umm to bad to undrinkable. I am leaving this review now as I am back on Amazon searching for another coffee maker.  Just gross..."
"June 15, 2021",CLR452,5.0,,"This is our 3rd one. We will continue to buy this coffee maker each time the other one needs replacing, every 7-10 years. No carafe to break or clean great tasting coffee. Easy to clean."
"October 15, 2020",Jill Glenn,1.0,,This product( which I bought many of these years over the years ) has begun to malfunction .. the coffee stops brewing and you have to cut it on and off or mess with it to get it to start brewing again.. I’ve had 3 or 4 that do it ...so I quit buying it
"March 22, 2021",Taras Chubenko,5.0,,Great unit and quick to set up.
"January 20, 2020",christine NEFF,3.0,,"The flavor is fine, very convenient, too.  Drawbacks are the warmer is super loud (can’t even be in the same room if the warmer is on) and if you don’t empty the tank of leftover coffee, it leaks.  Nothing like coming home from work to a countertop full of coffee.  :("
"July 20, 2020",Robert Johns,4.0,,It just to dang difficult to clean the coffee reservoir.
"August 2, 2010",Sharla R. Dobbins,4.0,One,"I had the first generation of this coffee pot. I always wished the release paddle was taller. Hamilton Beach solved that problem with this model. However, the coffee release/paddle is very close to the body of the machine. If I don't line my cup up just right, I spill coffee everywhere. Also, filling the machine is messy. The reservoir has a hole at the top, so if you over-fill it a tiny bit, water comes gushing out the back of the machine. It does get the coffee super hot, and it keeps it hot for up to four hours. Love the digital display. I also love that I can set the coffee to make, and when it finishes in the morning, it signals me with a little beep. I don't get out of bed until I hear that little beep. :) UPDATE: Another feature that would be nice is a ""keep warm"" time extender. On the weekends, we drink coffee all day. There's no way to extend the ""keep warm"" time past the four hours."
"June 10, 2020",This was totally overpricedat 6.99 the shipping for just this item was 8.00. Its only 2 inches high.,1.0,,"This started leaking the 2nd day we used it and continued to leak worse everyday.  We thought the cup we used was to thick, tried to check out the spout where the coffee came out ,couldn't adjust it. the following week noticed the back is also leaking. We already threw out the box to return it. READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS BEFORE BUYING. Some have complained of the same problem."
"July 16, 2018",Alexandra O'Connor,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  I tried a Keurig and they're just not for me - I could never get the coffee to taste right.  With this coffee maker, I can just make 3 cups and it takes less than 4 minutes to brew and fills the average travel mug.  I've had 2 of these Hamilton Beach coffee makers--after my first one broke, I ordered another on amazon and got same day shipping!"
"June 7, 2016",Greg,5.0,One,"Works well, it took a little getting used to not having a pot handy, but the convenience of the dispenser makes it worth it.  And if you ever need to, you can use the reservoir to pour into a container that does not fit, though this is less convenient than a pot."
"May 13, 2020",R. A consumer,1.0,,"Used this coffee makerfor one week and it began to leak, we had one like it prior to this one it lasted 2 years and the dispenser quit working."

"March 16, 2020",KDR,5.0,,Coffee maker redesign is a better design and easier to add cold water. Warmer appears to keep coffee hotter than previous model. Hope product quality of this product is as good as previous model with life of almost 3 years.

"August 24, 2016",SwimGirl,1.0,6,"Shortly after I bought this coffeemaker in August, I posted a 4-star review because I was very pleased with it.  Not anymore.  After just four months, the reservoir that holds the brewed coffee is leaking back into the water reservoir.  There is no way to tell where it's leaking from and because it's going back into the water reservoir, the reservoir is never empty and continues to rebrew the coffee leaking into it.  FOUR MONTHS is all this lasted!!! I have to pay for postage to ship it back and postage to have a new one shipped.  Who's to say it won't happen again?  It's now in the garbage and a cheap Mr Coffee is now it's replacement.  DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER!!!  Serious flaws that need to be worked out.  If I could give it zero stars, I would."
"December 31, 2019",Marie Williams,5.0,,Coffee never tastes burnt even if it sits in pot for hours! Love pushing button to fill my cup. Easy to clean.
"June 24, 2021",DLR,5.0,,This is a great product. The coffee never tastes burned like other coffee makers.
"June 8, 2018",GDS,2.0,,"Love the design and ability of this coffee maker to keep coffee warm and tasty for hours.  I don't like that the drainage filter clogs after 9-10 months, making the coffee maker useless.  Only buy if you are willing to repurchase every year."

"August 15, 2020",Charles G. Provenza,2.0,,We LOVED this machine when. It was new but it didn’t last more than a year before it started to leak all over the counter. The labels wore off and it is not easy to clean. I guess you can’t expect much for $40
"July 27, 2017",Nancy N,5.0,One,"Edit: Still going strong after 3 1/2 years! Original review: After having made 40+ pots of coffee with this, I can honestly say that this is the best home coffee maker I've ever used. It's easy to use, easy to clean, easy to set, and it makes great coffee."
"December 5, 2020",Tuck Finn,1.0,,They put the drip tray on this unit for a reason this is my third one and it started leaking right from the get-go. The other units didn't leak until after years of use I am very disappointed this one is going back.
"August 14, 2016",Ginny H.,4.0,,"I have had this type of coffee maker for several years.  This is my third one of this type.  The pros of this model are that you can get just one cup of coffee at a time, and the rest stays hot inside the reservoir without burning (like the bottom of the glass carafe).  The minus is that it is very difficult to use the bucket to fill the machine with water without spilling it."
"December 22, 2015",Ingrid,1.0,One,Plugged in my new coffe maker to find out it's a lemon. Called the manufacturer and was told they will send a new one as long as I pay $11.99 for shipping. If new one has the same problem don't know what to do. Sorry I bought it in the first place.
"May 3, 2021",Joaquín Ortega Gamez Nunez,5.0,,"Great coffee maker...  easy , great features..."
"January 7, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Love the coffee pot and would have given a 5 rating except I think it needs some “gripper tabs on the bottom because it slides backwards when the cup is pushed against the dispenser button. Makes good coffee.
"January 11, 2018",Tripti,5.0,,"After having cuisinart and Mr Coffee pots die earlier than they should have, I decided to try something new and I have no regrets! Its really nice having no carafe to hold to pour coffee, its hot and brews semi fast. Perfect!"

"March 31, 2018",Unicorn farts,2.0,,"Does not hold a full 12 cups of water, leaks from the back of the coffee maker.  I liked the older version of this model much better. I am very dissapointed with this new model."
"April 2, 2019",Dubble D,1.0,One,The reservoir leaked all over my counter some how. I’m glad I noticed before it soaked my hardwood floors.
"September 9, 2018",Mike,5.0,,"Had for a couple months now and working awesome no issues except, I can say it took 6 weeks for me to stop trying to grab the carafe! :)"
"November 24, 2015",golfin' Nana,2.0,,"We have used HB coffeemakers for the past 6 years. This one is junk. We purchased it in March and used it until May 4. We are snowbirds so the coffeemaker wasn't used again until late October. The unit was leaking water, making a terrible humming noise, and generally not completely operational. We are very disappointed as we like the coffeemaker without having a carafe. I would not recommend buying this unit."
"January 22, 2021",Michael Hamilton,1.0,,"We got this product because there was one at a hotel we stayed at. This model was terrible. We are getting a new coffee maker just after a month and a half. Every time we get a cup it leaks down the back side of the spout and it doesn’t drain into the drain, but rather leaks on the counter."
"August 12, 2020",SusanA,1.0,,We've had this product before and it lasted for years. I bought one earlier this year and exchanged it because it was leaking. The replacement is already leaking and makes a mess. Very disappointed. Will not even try this again.
"June 24, 2017",Lester Ratliff,4.0,,This coffee maker is as advertised except for one thing.  The coffee maker is NOT one hand dispensing as promised.  You have to hold your hand on the back to keep it from moving.  It may be one hand dispensing on some surfaces but definitely not on Formica type surfaces. This is the reason for my 4 star rating.
"October 24, 2018",John Langley,5.0,,"Had one for years, then it finally gave up the ghost. Glad to see they still make them. Love it"
"June 4, 2021",Denise G.,4.0,,I purchased this awhile ago and it works great.  I like not having a glass carafe.  It's easy to use and clean.  My coffee tastes great and is programable to be ready first thing in the morning.
"January 4, 2016",Ken M,2.0,,This is our third purchase of this model. The design really fits our needs but reliability is not good at all. These machines tend to leak - easily fixable but why should you have to? This last one leaked right out of the box. My previous two wound up in the garbage after less than a year. The warmer plate failed on one of them and circuit board failed on the other.
"November 15, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"Love this item, just a few little things wish it cleaned just a little easier. The shipping to me was fast, would get again brews very fast"
"January 13, 2017",CrimsonOgre,5.0,One,"Hot coffee straight in the cup, no half awake juggling of the carafe.  Hard not to love this thing, less mess and a very nice coffee maker."
"May 20, 2021",Katie,5.0,,I like everything about it.
"March 15, 2021",momof3,4.0,,My only complaint is that it is pretty noisy.
"December 25, 2019",Ron Diaz,4.0,,"Works good, would like it better if it kept the coffee a little bit hotter but other than that it works just fine."
"January 22, 2015",Jack,5.0,2,"I've had this coffee maker for about a month now and I really like it. I don't believe there is a perfect automatic coffee maker on the market, however this is the best I've ever owned. My previous unit was made by Kitchen Aid, I suffered through a year and a half of abuse with that poorly designed machine. Prior to that I had a Bunn that wasted energy and burned out in less than a year. Both of those were nearly three times the cost of this unit. The Hamilton Beach is like a breath of fresh air. I grind my own beans so I am fairly picky about the  taste of my coffee. This unit delivers! The coffee is kept warm for one to four hours without sitting on a hot plate and acquiring a burnt taste, or in a thermal container that loses heat by the minute. The idea of dispensing the coffee rather that than having to pour it from a carafe is a great idea. I use a large black cup and have no problem with making a mess when dispensing. The only possible problem would be over filling the cup (coffee is black and the inside of the cup is black) because I can't judge when the cup is filled. I solved that by adding half and half to my cup prior to dispensing, problem solved. This unit is a little slower to brew a full pot, about 8 to 10 minutes from start to finish. If you are anxious for your first cup you can pour it before the complete brewing cycle is complete. So waiting four to five minutes is not a big problem. However you can set the machine up to brew automatically so it is ready when your get up. It's easy to program and the instructions are written in a plain easy to understand way. I could never figure out how to program the Kitchen Aid. The water reservoir is balanced so when you hold it by the handle when filling with water you can see exactly how much water you have in the container. It's simple to pour the water into the coffee maker, a big arrow shows you where to pour. Some have found this to be messy, but my wife or I have not had a problem with this step. The basket with your filter sits on top, you close the lid, and press start. It can't get simpler than that. When finished the basket and the reservoir should be washed in hot soapy water . The only possible problem I see is the entire unit is made of plastic, and I'm not sure how well the plastic will hold up under repeated use. So far I have no problems as it cleans up beautifully. All in all I give this Coffee Maker my highest rating, if problems crop up in the future I will modify my review. 2/17/15 Update: When the unit needs to be cleaned the display will flash a ""CLEAN"" sign after 30 cycles or when residue builds up on the sensor. Cleaning sounds pretty straight forward, two cup of vinegar, turn on, after 20 seconds turn off, wait 30 minutes turn on again.Turn off when finished. When cool dispense several cups before emptying and rinsing the reservoir. OK, I've done this twice and the ""CLEAN"" message is still blinking. When trying to brew a pot of coffee, the machine keeps gurgling for a long period of time. I've written (e-mail) to Hamilton Beach asking for help, after 3 days I haven't received a response. If this problem isn't solved I will have to revise my rating."
"March 10, 2021",Deborah,5.0,,This is my 3rd one love it
"October 22, 2020",Sophie Paul,1.0,,"The little metal drip saver tray under the pedal did not fit so it's loose, coffee brew so fast that it has no flavor. I purchased that coffee maker in August and in october it is leaking all other the counter, coffee dripping everywhere. Do not buy this coffee maker!"
"September 1, 2013",John R. Willis,4.0,One,"Works as intended. Relatively easy to use. Display nice and bright. Blue led edgelighting of LCD display. Short power cord might be an issue if you don't have an outlet close, withing 2 feet. Will work with cone as well as cupcake filters, just have to press the cones down into shape inside the coffee basket. Comes apart easily, dispenser works  Makes a great cup of Joe."
"March 26, 2019",Linda,2.0,,"This machine is easy to use, however , it uses a type of hot plate to keep the coffee at temp. The coffee becomes stale after about an hour. I do like the concept of no pot to lift though."
"August 16, 2020",Connie P.,2.0,,Ordered 8 months ago last few Weeks coffee leaked all over my counter. Also when basket holding grounds is removed clean water leaks and fills up on both sides of heating element which i drain with a sponge.
"August 29, 2015",Cookie,1.0,One,"Stopped working after a few months. The water line/pump is not working. It takes 45minutes to brew 8-10cups. It stops every cup so I have to shut off and turn on. If I can get it close to 4 cup Mark I turn on 1-4cup program to pull most of the rest. Water is always left in side compartment. I am buying different brand, fed up."
"January 9, 2015",The Peanut,2.0,,I love the whole idea of this. I tried several times even after washing it out with soap and water. I ran water through it. Yet no matter what I tried it left an awful bitter and nasty taste in my mouth. I even tried both strength and adding more coffee and less coffee. Nothing helped the bad taste. But I can say I had no dripping issues and would have loved for this to have made better tasting coffee. It just ruined every pot I made.
"December 31, 2020",Brenda,5.0,,Love this coffee pot and it's many features. Highly recommended. Great price.
"May 17, 2014",M. Clark,1.0,2,"I bought one of these for two reasons: it has good reviews, and my mother is happy with hers. It's turned out to be the worst coffee maker I've ever owned. • It dribbles.When I get to the end of a tank and am pouring out the last little bit, it doesn't pour into my cup. Instead, the flow hugs the contour of the coffee maker and runs down the front of the coffee maker. It's a mess. • When I first bought it, the coffee seemed hot. After a few weeks of use, the temperature dropped. Now it's warm, and if you add cream/milk a cup of coffee, it's enough to sap what little warmth it had. I have to nuke every cup. • I thought that it would be more convenient to setup a pot of coffee, but it's more work.You have to take off the grounds holder to get to the tank, and then you have to take off the tank to get to the water reservoir. And you always need to wash the tank. A carafe, you don't. • I thought, ""No carafe, so one less thing to clean."" Not so. You still have to clean the coffee tank every time you use it because it never empties. You'll always have a bit of ""the last pot"" in the tank that you need to pour out. They picture somebody using the tank to fill the reservoir, but unless you clean the tank really well every time you use it, you'll be pouring a bit off old coffee in the reservoir. I'm not a complainer—this is only the second one-star review I've ever given. It's just a terrible product, in my experience."
"March 5, 2021",L. wollman,3.0,,Water gets all over when changing filter
"April 17, 2020",nanaskids,1.0,One,"Should have believed the reviews, coffee leaks when pouring into cup don't like having to wipe up coffee every time I want a cup. Heating plate very loud. Will be returning. I can't in all honesty recommend this coffee maker."
"September 21, 2016",John W. Budesa,4.0,,"The product is easy to assembly and install, and brews coffee quickly.  The ""pot-less"" pour is a very nice feature.  After completing a brew, and going to clean the grinds/filter, there is significant condensation at the top of the pot.  The available features for setting the duration to ""keep the pot warm"" and option to brew a bold roast are nice to have."

"February 2, 2021",Snooks,1.0,,"The coffee was okay, but the messy wetness on counter from steam was frustrating.  It was not easy to clean, and today, it died."
"October 26, 2019",Amazon Customer,2.0,,The quality of the model we purchase could have been much better. We have purchased other Hamilton Beach models previously and could not locate that particular model at the time we purchased this particular model. It makes very good coffee but I was disappointed in the quality of this coffee maker. Thank you
"May 21, 2021",Heather,2.0,,"The coffee maker is very nice looking & works great but leaks coffee from the dispensing spout, down the front & somehow misses the drip tray to accumulate under the coffee maker & on to the counter. The leak goes unnoticed until time to clean the reservoir. Unfortunately, coffee can etch marble countertops."
"January 17, 2021",Amanda Giggi,1.0,,"We purchased this to replace our Cuisinart, mostly to save about $40. It leaked. The whole machine moved when dispensing. And there is no coffee gauge, so we had no idea how much coffee was left. Also, there was no light to see how full your mug is. Ultimately, we returned this and bought the exact same Cuisinart we had."
"June 25, 2018",seethestars,5.0,,I’ve been using these plotless coffee brewers for years & I love them! Hamilton Beach makes a great one!
"February 20, 2021",Melissa r.,2.0,,This coffee maker leaks every time you pour a cup! I bought it in hopes it would be as good as the last Hamilton beach brew station I had. This one is junk!!! Now I’m stuck with buying another new coffee maker and I’m thinking about steering clear of the Hamilton beech name!!
"March 24, 2018",Karen Sloane,2.0,,"This did not work when I got it. Then there was all the trouble of mailing it back and Amazon would not take it because I had waited to use it or something. However, I did contact Hamilton Beach and they were willing to stand behind their product as long as I mailed it back to them! What a hassle for a coffee maker. I don't trust the shipping process for these."
"July 1, 2021",Katherine Moloney,1.0,,Broke two months after purchase
"November 4, 2017",Michael,3.0,,Love the coffee pot but it has one huge problem! It does not keep the coffee very hot . I have to microwave each cup after the first 2 cups! It's causing me to buy another coffee pot! I really liked the design but it needs to work properly!
"June 6, 2020",Carolyn Hipsher,2.0,,"flashed clean on 2nd day I used it and even after 3 cleanings using directions, still flashing clean.  I feel like this product had been used and returned prior to me getting it.  Don't have the info to return it which is what I should have done. Still using it but makes a lot of noise when making coffee and still flashing clean."
"April 20, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Great product at a reasonable value . Coud be a little quieter when brewing
"December 18, 2018",Jack Gilbert,5.0,,"Works like a champ, No assy. just plug in, add filter, coffee and push the button. Coffee in about 12 minutes. No glass crafts to worry about breaking. safe!"
"October 18, 2018",SBX,5.0,,"I have had this coffee maker for almost three years, so I thought it was time to write a review. I have never had a problem with it. I love how it holds the coffee and keeps it warm up to four hours! No glass carafe sitting on a hotplate to burn your coffee. When it is time to replace, I will definitely purchase again!"
"June 30, 2018",Sarah Cover,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker!  It's really nice to be able to choose how long it keeps my coffee warm, and I love that there's no carafe to break. The only teensy little nitpick is that you have to hold the back when you dispense coffee, or the whole thing slides away from you. It seems like some grippy feet on the bottom would solve that pretty easily."
"July 6, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"This is my second Hamilton coffee maker. I’ve only had it a short time, and it’s doing the same thing the last one did.  I tried to make a second pot of coffee while company is here.  It won’t!  Leaking, coffee not hot….going to return it!"
"March 14, 2020",Michael Smit,1.0,,"Easy to clean, use, and coffee tastes great. But the seal on water canister has already started leaking water on my countertop and heating pad inside stopped working."
"October 13, 2011",Cricket Rue,5.0,,"I really like my new Brewstation.  I was searching for a coffee maker that grinds the whole beans, however, I wasn't willing to pay $120.00 plus.  Especially since my previous one stopped grinding after one year!  The Brewstation is easy to load, and clean.  Aesthetically, it matches my other stainless appliances.  Love the bold or regular brew option and the warmer timer.  I highly recommend the  Brewstation to those that are searching for an alternative to over priced coffee makers."
"March 15, 2019",Patrick Huebner,5.0,,"glad we got this.  Works as well as the original that worked for 6 years, but it easier to fill than the old model."

"January 2, 2020",Paul Sawyerii,5.0,,I'm really impressed with the Hamilton coffee station the coffee taste great and it has so many opions we just love it
"May 20, 2013",YvrTex,4.0,,"Was hesitant about purchasing, but glad I did!  Works great, coffee stays hot, no carafe to clean up!  No mess!  The only thing I would say is, make sure the pot has been standing empty for several hours before removing the filter and water basket to empty, otherwise there is quite a bit of water that comes off the filter basket and if you don't hold paper towel under it to remove it, you will wear it.  Other than that, happy with it!"
"August 25, 2015",W. Turnbow,5.0,One,"My wife and I have had the previous model (we experienced good service for a few years from the first one and replaced it with another of the very same model when it was necessary) of the Hamilton Beach BrewStation and this one is the best yet. It's easy to use and maintain, and there is no glass carafe to worry about breakage. Unlike the first model we owned, this version also has the capability allowing filling of tall or commuter-type cups."
"May 9, 2016",ADAM HADNOTT,4.0,One,"I like this coffee maker, it's light, easy to use, brews great coffee on the Bold setting. The only thing I would change with the design is to make it so it does not slide across the counter top when you push the dispenser button in front. We place it against the back wall after brewing is done which prevents it from sliding. This is still an awesome coffee maker with the price, the bold and ice coffee brew settings."
"July 30, 2020",Heidi Meyers,5.0,,Definitely worth the price. Good quality. I'd buy it again
"February 13, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"We purchased the Hamilton Beach Brewmaster January 9th.  Makes great coffee.  Have been looking for a brewmaster for quite some time.  I am so disappointed because when I pour a cup of coffee, coffee leaks out of the button your cup presses in.  Coffee comes dripping down into the base and all over the counter."
"February 28, 2021",Stephanie Powell,1.0,,"I normally love this coffee pot, but 3 days after purchasing this one it began to leak badly around dispenser. I have owned 3 other coffee pots just like this one and never had an issue. I was very disappointed, it seems they are not as concerned for quality anymore. I sent this unit back."
"March 1, 2018",Herb H,5.0,One,"Very nice coffee maker, easy to use and really like the removable water tank (eliminates spills). Overall good design and makes very good coffee."
"October 20, 2014",Larry E. Jester,1.0,8,"The coffee is not HOT!!! Yes, there is a place for cold coffee but not from a fresh brewed pot. Buying this Hamilton Beach********** should include a microwave. p.s. previous pot was Cuisinart, very similar in design with one glaring difference, THE COFFEE WAS HOT! it lasted a couple of years."
"March 6, 2017",Floyd H.,5.0,,i love how i can prepare the coffee the night before and wake up to the smell of coffee.easy to clean the only thing i for me is that it needs to be placed in front of a wall or something to prevent it getting pushed back when you are grabbing coffee. i have to hold on the top while grabbing coffee due to it being near the edge of the counter.
"July 9, 2021",Elisabet rodriguez,5.0,,Muy fácil de usar y el café sale caliente no tibio muy buena cafetera
"January 25, 2018",Amazon Customer,4.0,,I had a coffee maker like this before.  I you like strong coffee this one would not be for you.  There are a lot of holes in the filter holder so the water flows out fast.  I use the bold setting and it works good for me.
"January 21, 2011",cajunrose,5.0,One,"We've had this coffeemaker for about a month now and we love it!  There's no carafe to get all stained and nasty.  It keeps the coffee warm for 4 hours without cooking it.  If you need to turn it back on after the 4 hours are up, press and hold the ""on"" button for 3 seconds.  It comes back on without telling you to add water.  I have no problem filling the tank with water - I use my pull out faucet to pour water directly into the tank, so no spilling.  I have it next to my sink, so when taking out the filter holder I shake it over my sink to get rid of the excess water.  The lid does hold a good bit of water from the steam, but I tap it a couple of times and open it slowly so not very much drips down the outside.  Every coffeemaker I've had did this.  Not a big deal, I just use a paper towel to wipe it up.  Now, as far as dispensing the coffee:  I figured if anyone would make a mess, it would be my husband.  His hands are very shaky due to problems with his nervous system.  He gets his coffee in his cup everytime without spilling a drop.  Many complaints were made about the dispensing nozzle being too far back and coffee pouring on the outside of their cups.  This is not a problem at all for us.  This has to be the best coffeemaker we've had, and I hope it lasts a long time (fingers crossed)."
"February 20, 2015",Leslie,1.0,2,"I loved the idea of the removable water reservoir and not having a carafe, but the design makes it hard to clean.  As well as the fact that the coffee would leak down underneath the heating element.  The biggest reason for giving this product a bad review includes the event of the coffeemaker having an internal malfunction and not working after only two months!  Even worse, I tried to obtain a refund and send the machine back, but Hamilton Beach only replaces the product and then charges the consumer for shipping the new machine, even though it was their faulty product to begin with.  I will NEVER buy another Hamilton Beach and plan to stick with the well-made coffeemaker brands such a Mr. Coffee in the future."
"February 22, 2021",mary seelig,2.0,,Bought a new one of these because our old one started leaking out the bottom and the dispenser wouldn’t allow for a good steam. The new one also leaks and I can already feel the dispenser starting to go.
"September 18, 2018",T. Nelson,4.0,,Perfect for daughter's dorm room.  She can make a cup or a travel mug sized of hot or cold coffee.  She loves it.
"December 12, 2014",DSMT Serrano,3.0,,"I love the concept of this machine, BUT its sad that it is not a more sturdy machine, the water basin top broke right away did not even last the week.  Not sure who broke it but I imagine they tried to open it from the wrong side.  Yes its our fault but the design can be deceiving on how to open the top. One of the most important thing in our coffee makers is to see the amount of coffee that it remaining in the pot but sadly it is of no use, being that there is some  coffee condensation and it seem to show that there is still some coffee when actually it is completely empty. But most of All the worse flaw is that the coffee maker is that it ""burns  the coffee"" might be a defect on our's but, I can hear the sizzle of coffee even 20 minutes after the coffee has brewed, it doesn't just keep it warm but burn's it. I was a bit sad i thought we had at last found the perfect coffee maker."
"December 13, 2016",John N Street,5.0,One,"I love it!! Easy to use, keeps coffee warm for as long as you want/need, and no carafe needed. A revolutionary concept in the relatively unchanged coffee maker market. I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, but needlessly as it turns out. The only negative is that the plastic housing looks a little 'cheap', but otherwise an outstanding product."
"November 17, 2018",beautifulisme,1.0,One,The coffee comes out super watered down and the machine broke not even a year later.
"January 16, 2020",scott benson,3.0,,I had the original machine and the drip tray was attached much better design because there’s no chance of it leaking underneath. The version I have now leaks like a sieve
"March 23, 2018",Jessica,5.0,,"My parents used to have this coffee pot and I loved it. When it came time for me to get a new one for myself I knew this was the one I wanted.

"September 18, 2020",AASpeer07,1.0,,"The attached photo was taken after pouring myself a single cup of coffee. It leaks every single time you use it.  It's simply just a crappy coffee maker.  If you like having to clean up spilled coffee every single time you pour it, I recommend buying us.  Otherwise, avoid it all costs."
"March 1, 2016",Ren Ren,4.0,,"Easy to use, pours nicely, keeps coffee hot for a good long time, and most importantly, no coffee pot to risk breaking! It's a cheaper looking model than the last one we had, but we're still happy with it. The beep that lets you know the machine's done brewing is a little on the soft side, so don't head out to another room or you may not hear it. Overall, it's a good coffee maker for the price."
"August 21, 2020",Anonymous,1.0,,Awful! Already thrown away after 2 months of use. Leaks everywhere
"June 29, 2021",woody,5.0,,We love this.Have used this same pot for years.
"February 5, 2013",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I had an older version of the Brewstation and really liked it, except the brew tank developed a leak and had to be replaced twice in 4 years. This model does have some drawbacks, as a few of the other reviews pointed out...like water dripping down the back when you open the lid, which I can deal with.  My one main complaint is having to move it out from under the cabinet to open the lid, which I do 3 times a day, and it doesn't slide easily. That's not a problem if you have an open counter to put it on. All-in-all, though, I love the brew tank delivery vs a glass carafe, and it is easy to clean...plus it's great being able to program it to brew automatically in the morning."
"June 17, 2021",Tracy B,5.0,,Easy to use and program.  Excellent and tasty coffee
"June 16, 2021",Katherine Nowlin,5.0,,This has been the best buy. My fiance drinks coffee all day. 12 cups is perfect and the 4 hour warming keeps it perfect. So easy to use and clean. Highly recommend
"March 29, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Superb we use it every day. Nothing can be any better. I’m glad we have this one we are especially pleased.
"February 27, 2020",Amy F.,5.0,,I love it. No more broken pots. Brews quickly.
"March 10, 2021",Terry Hall,5.0,,Works well and doesn’t leak.  Happy here.
"January 9, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Very unhappy with this product. Had it for nine months and it leaked all over our counters and floor. We only brew coffee when we have overnight company so it is definitely NOT overused. Followed all of the troubleshooting guides and it still leaks. Tried customer service.....practically non-existent! They are shipping us a part and charging us the shipping. Last time to purchase a Hamilton Beach product.
"December 26, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Easy to use and clean, unfortunately after about six months it started leaking a little and now it’s leaking horrible. Would not buy again as typically I have kept coffee makers for several years."
"June 6, 2021",Brian,5.0,,Exactly what I was looking for! Love this so much more than my Keurig.
"May 25, 2021",Karil,1.0,,Leaks through cup spout all the time! not easy to use!! Would not buy!
"May 15, 2021",AJ,1.0,,Do not buy!  This is the worst coffee maker.  It leaks all over the couter when you fill your cup.  I have had several Hamilton Beach coffee maker through the years and I am very disappointed in this one.  Hamilton Beach has always made great product up until this one.
"August 1, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Great price on this coffee maker.  I have purchased these for gifts a couple times and everyone loves them.
"October 20, 2019",Taylor,5.0,,Nice for the price
"July 1, 2019",Lu Colby,3.0,,"I paid a lot for this coffee pot and it’s nothing but a pain to make coffee in the morning. It seems like it would be more convenient but it’s not! Not easy to clean and use, and most importantly, it leaks all over my countertop! I’m constantly cleaning it! Coffee tastes good though but it takes FOREVER to brew. “While we’re young, people!”"
"April 16, 2021",Gene Viney,2.0,,The dispense mechanism leaks almost every time and is messy!
"February 7, 2019",Kensey corrine,1.0,One,"I got this for Christmas and not even a month after using it, it leaks about six cups every time. I can’t return because I bought early in December to have as a gift. Customer service will not respond to my emails. I am very unhappy."
"March 10, 2019",Jerry,5.0,,This was a good investment. The coffee maker works quite well and is as good as it says.
"October 29, 2020",Steven Bagenski,5.0,,I love this coffeemaker.  The coffee never burns or tastes bitter when it sits in the machine warming.  Never tastes old.
"July 10, 2018",Susan Stillwell,1.0,,"This is our third Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker in this style.  The first lasted over 3 years, the second one lasted about a year, and this third one lasted less than a month.  Not a good buy any more!  The cup dispenser is poorly made and got stuck pouring an entire pot of coffee all over the counter.  Switching styles and switching brands."
"November 18, 2018",VCD,5.0,,I like this coffee maker because there is NO COFFEE POT TO CLEAN! I used my first for 2 years every day without problems...it began leaking....but I felt 2 years was good for the price... .I was not disappointed. now I'm on my second one...very happy!!
"September 14, 2019",Eddie W.,5.0,,Great design. Very convenient.
"December 17, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,It takes alot to make a great cup of coffee. For the price and the ease of use I give it an A. Flavor is to me like a B+. I use it everyday.
"December 7, 2014",Chuck,1.0,4,We have had this coffee maker for about eight months now and has worked fine. Now it still makes coffee but you cant get it out of the machine without pouring it out of the top. We tried to call Hamilton Beach five times and could never get them to answer the phone. the last time we called we left the phone on speaker for four hours and never got through. Very poor customer service. We now have a Mr coffee.
"January 19, 2021",Emily Shoemaker,2.0,,"The product does leak, pressing the dispenser button w/ finger instead of cup alleviayes this issue. It is a more complicated process than expected. For a $50 item, the product is made cheap. My husband hates the product, I am patient with it. We may be returning it because it was more expensive than it's worth."
"January 1, 2017",peggygilileo,5.0,One,This is our first brewstation and we love it! The only fault I can find is it could use a small light where you dispense the coffee.Our cabinets are over our counters and you can't tell how much coffee is in the cup.Other than that we will never go back to a drip coffee maker!
"December 22, 2019",Batman,5.0,,Best coffee and so versatile with what you can make with it! Would recommend
"May 3, 2021",Kelley Ebersole,5.0,,"Makes bold flavor coffee, easy to use, like that a cup can be poured while still brewing and it's easy to clean."
"January 19, 2020",Terry,4.0,,"I needed a coffee maker that was not a single use only without a caraffe. Reasonable priced, fast delivery."
"January 15, 2020",Brad Moyes,4.0,,"I like that you can make 12 cups of coffee (1/2 gal) and keep it hot for up to 4 hrs in a self contained unit (no decanter to break). The only down side was that after a couple years the old one started to leak, so I purchased A new one."
"January 7, 2021",Shirley Mccarty,1.0,,it leaks coffee on the counter
"June 17, 2020",john,2.0,,sent 2 of them back both leaked bad around the push bar to fill cup. bought a different kind do not recommend.
"June 16, 2018",Talooloo,1.0,,"Not durable:  purchased in Nov 2016 and the percolator pump quit working in Jun 2018...basically good for 1.5 years.  Another minor drawback is that most travel mugs won't fit under the dispenser.  Lastly, the dispensing flow would occassionally slow down, and that's a sign to clean the small filter bulb/screen, which is part of the regular ownership experience."
"June 28, 2020",Kim B,3.0,,This is my second time buying this coffee maker and there is a glitch that leaks when it pours out so coffee streams down the side of the coffee pot on the outside of the cup. It’s messy and an annoyance but the coffee is still convenient
"August 8, 2018",Laura Hollyer-Madis,1.0,,I bought this for my 85 year old mom who did not open it for over a year because her other coffee maker was still working.  We recently opened it made 1 pot of coffee and it completely died.  I have no recourse because the warranty ran out before it was ever opened....disappointing.
"April 17, 2021",Sluggo,5.0,,Love this one. Easy to use and clean
"November 21, 2020",Holly Jones,1.0,,"I bought this coffee maker for my moms birthday. It worked great at first, but after a few months it started leaking around the screws. They tried to fix it but they couldn’t. This is too much money to spend on something that didn’t even last 6 months"
"December 29, 2020",FELIX,5.0,,"Todo bien, gracias!"
"March 8, 2019",Michael Harris,5.0,,This is an awesome coffee pot easy to work and easy to clean.  Great quality.
"May 13, 2018",BH,4.0,,"I love the product. This is my 4th one, I just wish there were more replaceable parts. The last one saw the sealing washer on the carafe start leaking, but no way to access it for replacement."
"May 11, 2019",RUDY CASTRO,5.0,,This coffee maker is a must if you're a serious coffee drinker..Fantastic product
"January 1, 2021",Julie Pyatt,2.0,,"I used to have this type of coffee maker years ago and loved it. This one was much bigger and took up a lot of room on the counter.  That would have been ok, but the coffee wasn't as hot as I would like, so I returned it."
"May 8, 2021",Tamara J. Croll,3.0,,Leaked and did not last long. Design was cheaply done.
"July 21, 2017",Coburncorner,1.0,One,"Would be no stars if possible.  First one would gradually (over a period of an hour and a half) heat coffee to just before boiling and would scorch the coffee.  Replacement for it, on the first use, had the coffee in a rolling boil in about 45 minutes.  Started with 12 cups of coffee, but in about an hour had boiled four cups away.  Totally undrinkable."
"April 13, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"My coffee brew maker started leaking 3 months after I got it...couldn’t get product support from black and decker nor amazon due to virus..have to throw it out...cleaned it many tens,,did what they said and still leaks...."
"November 22, 2020",Leslie Novak,5.0,,YOU must know that dumping the water into one container and then pouring it into another is a pain and usually it pours out on the counter. With this machine you simply fill the receptacle and set the receptable on the machine and press (either delay time) start. Bingo. Love it !!
"March 28, 2021",Anika,4.0,,"Love this ability to just fill the cup vs a pot. Only reason I gave a 4 start vs 5, is the temp of the coffee. I prefer very HOT coffee and although the temp is hot, it’s not as hot as ide like. It does keep it warm though & really like the iced coffee function too"
"July 8, 2015",E. Wait,1.0,One,"This is the third BrewStation I've had, and I'm really disappointed in Hamilton Beach. When they redesigned the coffee machine for the reservoir, they changed the design, so now there are two chambers on each side of the warming plate that collect condensation, and the water needs to be cleaned out every 2-3 days."
"December 30, 2015",Dad4-3,4.0,One,"We love the fact that we don't need to use a carafe and that we can keep our coffee hot internally.  The auto shutoff for the warming feature is a plus.  The only downside is that it's pretty light and when you push on the coffee release with the mug, the unit slides back unless you have it against the back wall.  Other than that, it's a nice unit."
"November 20, 2016",Jennifer D,4.0,,Coffee doesn't stay really hot in the container.  Also would be really great if it had a light by the spout because it's hard to tell how much coffee is coming out.  If you have a dark coffee cup you can't tell at all.  All in all works well just would like if the coffee stays hot.
"September 5, 2020",LabRat58,1.0,,"Great for making coffee but, it leaks around the dispenser. Sent it back."
"February 22, 2021",Jeff L. Upp,1.0,,"The coffee maker leaked coffee while trying to fill your cup, it would end up with 1/2 a cup of coffee all over the counter & would run into the drawer. Needless to say, I shipped it back for a full refund."
"October 22, 2019",C.,1.0,,"I guess you get what you pay for. This did not work as adverised. It never kept the coffee warm and it did not brew hot coffee, more like luke warm. I absolutely love the concept, but the execution is poor."
"December 28, 2017",Julie Luffman,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot.  It is easy to add water to, has different settings for boldness and cups and I like that is emits a beep when the coffee is done."
"October 25, 2016",Jeanne Bumpus,5.0,One,"This is the second one I have owned, didn't know they still made them until I looked on Amazon.  So much easier and cleaner to use. Good job Hamilton Beach."
"February 14, 2014",Bethanie J Hagues,5.0,,"I've enjoyed using this coffeemaker at my son's home, and, after wearying of k-cup litter, ordered one for myself.  Yes, there's condensation when you lift the lid, and yes, the cord is (appropriately) short for a countertop appliance.  I wish it fit underneath the cabinet above.  But, there's no glass carafe to clean, or to make my wrist ache with the lifting.  My tallest cup fits easily under the dispenser.  Instead of debating what constitutes a ""cup,"" I recommend measuring out the water with your coffee cup, observe how many ""cups"" fill the reservoir and let that be your standard of measure.  (Mind the slosh-over drain in back, and stop filling just short of that to avoid mopping up.).  My son and his wife have been using theirs for six years, and I expect to enjoy mine for many years, as well."
"May 4, 2020",Jenny lound,1.0,,Leaks... cheaply made...to expensive...very dissatisfied with this coffee pot! We had the older version of this and it was a lot better!
"November 14, 2020",Linda B.,5.0,,Product came slightly cosmetically damaged; but it is my 3rd one. We love the eaze of cleaning. Coffee warmer perfect.
"February 18, 2021",De,3.0,,The coffee maker produced a very strong plastic taste. I treated it with vinegar numerous times and also soda. Stuffed it with newspaper to absorb odor and we can finally enjoy our coffee! However it does drip when dispensing which is disappointing.
"December 3, 2019",Melissa ortiz,3.0,One,The delivery was 2 days late and this is what the box looked like when I finally got it. Product scratched but still useable. Not at all happy with delivery
"August 2, 2018",PAL,3.0,,"I purchased this coffee pot two years ago for office use.  It worked great for the first 18 months, and then after that, the coffee would come out more and more slowly until now at the two year mark it is just a dribble.  Coffee also drips down the back and makes a mess.  We do use it heavily - two pots a day, every working day."
"August 16, 2019",sheryl,5.0,,"dislike: after coffee is brewed, it keeps on heating to a boil...don't  find an adjustment for heater... otherwise perfect!!!"
"October 15, 2019",Felicia Y Lopez,5.0,,I love this Brew station I had an older version for 6 years and needed an upgrade
"July 3, 2016",TucsonJenn,5.0,,"I love love love this coffee maker! I've  never had a drip coffee maker before... I highly recommend this one. The programmable ease of this machine is worth every penny. No burned coffee flavor, no carafe to clean out... I also recommend getting the reusable filter with it. Enjoy!"
"September 7, 2019",Amy,5.0,,"We love the dispenser! We love that it doesn't have a carafe! It just works better this way for us. Easy to fill with water, easy to program, and love the 4 hour warm setting. We have no complaints!"
"September 8, 2015",Carrie,3.0,,This coffee maker is VERY LOUD!  A sucking sound during and after making coffee. Tries to suck up the last bit of water in holder. The condensation collects at the bottom of the coffee holder. I have to empty it every couple of days. The plus side is it brews the best tasting coffee. Nice and hot coffee. The water reservoir is very convenient to fill.
"March 26, 2014",Sheryl Maitland,5.0,,"First consider the Price:  $ 42.50 & Amazon Prime.  How could anyone beat that?  Next, the coffee is kept Hot, no I mean HOT for as long as you like, up to 4 hours.  Best tasting coffee I've ever made, and that's just using Dunkin.  Machine is easy to use, written directions not very good, but everything is simple and settings are a snap.  I recommend a brown paper filter for the basket[ not the gold metal one].  The paper keeps all grounds out of the coffee and the taste is very smooth.  Two strength settings.  Regular & Bold.  I've tried both & Bold is alittle bitter for me, but some might like it.  Would buy again."
"June 13, 2021",PattiRae,3.0,,Leaks from dispensary spout
"January 15, 2018",Krisha,2.0,One,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas and am just so disappointed. I’m being generous by giving this a two star considering that it does indeed make the coffee but does not store it like it says it’s supposed to. Unless you consider coffee all over your counter from it leaking out the back as “storage”. Possibly mine is defective but from my experience, I wouldn’t suggest anyone else to buy this product."
"June 24, 2019",Dan,5.0,,Love that this doesn’t have a pot to clean!
"October 30, 2019",Teri,2.0,,"I know I bought this from the warehouse, I buy a lot from the warehouse, but the hot plate inside of the tank keeps burning and It get hard to clean."
"March 6, 2021",linda lukascewicz,1.0,,"Returned this item I thought it was what I wanted, Reordered a Cusinart like I previously had"
"May 20, 2021",Natalie123,2.0,,Coffee machine leaks water out of the bottom of the pot a lot of water. It is unfortunate because it makes good coffee and I like not having a glass pot to have to hold. My husband and I just fill our travel mugs and go. I have to throw it away because it’s past the return time.
"February 8, 2020",Alejandra,1.0,,"The actuator “Push tab” to dispense the coffee broke/ became flimsy and now it spills coffee without even pushing it, making a mess!! There is no fix to this and no replacement part to fix it.. I owned this for 4 months before this issue and now I can’t return it or exchange it!"
"April 3, 2019",Daniel,5.0,,Makes great quick coffee. Hasn’t failed me yet.
"June 8, 2019",Roger & Ellen,5.0,,Love this product. Keeps the coffee hot for a logical amount of time.
"September 1, 2011",Joshua Hall,1.0,One,"I loved the original one.  This one has all the great features described and makes a great pot of coffee in a flash... as well as keeps it warm without scalding it.  However, these qualities that are the selling point, contribute to the truly awful job of later cleanup.  It starts with the filter basket, whose seemingly hundreds of perforations make it great in brewing, drip from all points when transporting the filter to the waste, dripping old, cold, nasty coffee all over your kitchen.  Then, the coffee 'container' has a thousand unique, tiny, bolt-holes that store all the condensation that hours of keeping your coffee warm tends to do.  That condensation then immediately drips from these holes all over your floor once again.  Oh, and be very careful you don't accidentally touch the valve lever, inconveniently positioned at a 'convenient' support point underneath the device (I say this because if one uses solely the carrying handle, the container shifts off balance, rendering the measuring lines completely useless.) All in all, an absolutely worthless product.  Too late to return it though.  The convenience of keeping your coffee warm is far out-weighed by having to clean up after yourself each and every night when prepping your machine for the next morning."
"December 5, 2017",Elizabeth,5.0,,"Best coffee maker I've owned. I had one of these but an older model. Couldn't find the model for awhile. Got lucky and found this one on cyber monday for $23 after taxes. My husband is the sole user of it, it brews delicious coffee. I was super thrilled about the preset option! And very easy to set up too"
"January 28, 2014",peggy todd,4.0,,"It makes excellent coffee.  I do have two complaints. l.  The dispenser that you put your coffee cup against is a little squigggly feeling the way it is designed. 2.  It makes a good bit of noise keeping thecoffee hot. However, would like to repeat - Coffee is made quickly and tastes better than another brand that quit on me in 11 months of use - morning only - l pot. I would pick Hamilton Beach again in the future"
"February 28, 2017",Coach,5.0,One,I love this coffee maker! It makes excellent coffee and you can pour one cup at a time. Coffee stays warm for four hours!
"May 3, 2019",BJL,5.0,,"There are times it doesn’t seem to keep the coffee hot. Other than that, I have really been enjoying it. I also wish the small tray that is on there was big enough to sit a coffee cup on."
"September 4, 2020",Kim Dumont,5.0,,"have had this for almost a couple of years. works well, easy to clean"
"December 27, 2016",Andrew Miller,3.0,,water tnak leaks if water is left inside for more than an hour. recommend filling tank within a few mins of use...DO NOT LEAVE WATER IN TANK OVER NIGHT>>> came out to a huge puddle of water in the morning. needs to be cleaned at least once a month if used daily.  use room temp water ONLY. do not use cold water..coffee will be luke warm if cold water is used.
"December 17, 2020",Pamela Kaiser,2.0,,"This brew station is poorly designed.  When you dispense the coffee, part of the stream flows out behind the cup and runs down the front.  Yes there is a reservoir to catch the overflow but it is a hassle to clean it out after every use."
"April 17, 2020",Person_on_amazon,2.0,,"The first one we recieved it started leaking within the first or second use of the machine, so we exchanged it. The second machine we received lasted about two month before that too started to leak."
"September 8, 2018",1776 Patriot,5.0,One,"Love this appliance , had one in a hotel we stayed in & came home & brought 1 for us . easy clean , no pot to break , love this thing !!"
"April 16, 2018",J. Montague,1.0,,Purchased 8/23/2017 from amazon. Didn't even last 8 months.  Made coffee this morning and it only pumped half the water through.  Now won't do anything but heat and tell time.  Contacted Hamilton beach...hopefully I'll hear back!
"February 28, 2019",Laynie,1.0,,"I really needed to love this coffee maker. I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried all levels of grinding and different coffee filters. I’ve tried using the “strong brew” function. The taste is just off. I use high end coffee, by the way. I decided to accept the way it brews and move on, but it also does not keep the coffee hot for that four hour window. I’m beyond my return window. Very disappointed."
"May 20, 2017",Kate,4.0,,"This coffee pot is great! I had a really cheap one before that always tasted like plastic (even after almost a year of use). So my main requirement in a new coffee pot was that it not taste like plastic. This one did not disappoint! Great tasting coffee that is the perfect temperature! I also love the design. It's really easy to use and clean! The reason I give only four stars is that it can be very messy. I always manage to spill water as I'm filling it up or taking it apart to clean. I also get drops of coffee everywhere as I dump the filter and attempt to rinse the basket out. These are minor, though, and I imagine I'll get the hang of it over time."
"January 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Awesome coffee maker. Love the fact you can time it. Got it for my sister in law and she loves it.
"February 9, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Mine leaks too. Clearly a design flaw.
"May 30, 2017",Lgh116,1.0,,"Poorly made. So full of plastic and light weight that it slides around on the counter when you try to push the dispenser with a cup. Also, the water tank doesn't fit well on the unit. It looks crooked all the time and there is an uneven gap between the side of the coffee maker and the water tank."
"May 16, 2020",John E. Mask,5.0,,We purchased this Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker and have been using it for four years.  Works great and makes good coffee. Easy to use and has auto set so you can prepare coffee maker at might and coffee is ready next morning.  Highly recommend thus coffee maker.
"December 28, 2019",Brice Jarvis,5.0,,Like the functions
"April 13, 2018",Devin,5.0,,"This a great coffee maker for a great price. It took me awhile to figure out the programming. So, just a heads up if you are going to start a program for automated Brewing keep the green light on."
"December 5, 2018",Arthur Putman,4.0,,This pot is a reliable coffee pot. Have used these before and always switch back to this pot.

"January 21, 2011",Todd Haehn,5.0,,I purchased the Hamilton Beach 48465 Brewstation Summit Ultra 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker to use at work and it has been great.  The coffee stays hot the whole morning and it is easy to take the whole top of the unit to the sink in order to clean.  I have two small complaints:  I wish that the handle to carry the top of the unit would work with the grounds container in it and that that it is hard to tell how full your cup is when dispensing coffee (which can cause an overflow).
"May 30, 2021",Jo Anne Smith,5.0,,"I love this coffee dispenser.  Clean up is easy, makes great coffee"
"July 18, 2021",Chet Lee Kowalski,4.0,,It’s good. It does what I want it to do. It occasionally drops from the base. Just water though so beware of that.
"November 6, 2019",amanda m franco,5.0,,This is the best coffee pot without the pot ever!!!
"April 23, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,It worked great for the first month but after that it stopped working for more than 4 cups of coffee. It won’t make the up to 12 cups it’s supposed to.
"August 11, 2019",Julc,5.0,,awesome coffee maker
"October 1, 2018",Darryl Lawson,2.0,,"I liked the idea not having to clean a carafe every few months so I bought this product. It started great, dispensing hot coffee. But then for some reason, the coffee would come out everywhere but in my cup. It created quite a mess.  When reading the instructions to troubleshoot, it looked like a lot of work. I had to go to YouTube, because it wasn’t included in the handout. I’m not saying don’t buy because I haven’t found too many people with this issue. But be very careful. I think I will be going back to the carafe."
"May 10, 2021",ellen j noerr,5.0,,"This is third one we have had. All product have had same problem.  Will not process all water. This one after one month will only process 6cups and have to turn off and on.  NOT GOOD.  Not many choices out there, that’s main reason we have bought this product."
"December 26, 2018",Kathy Rouchelle for Cajun Heat Book Blog,5.0,,"Incredible! I can't say how much we are enjoying this maker. Easy to use, to set. Love it"
"February 11, 2017",Az Grandma,1.0,,Horrible coffee pot.  Top doesn't fit on bottom exactly right so it makes a sizzling noise the ENTIRE time it is on.  My mistake I threw away the box and the garbage man came before I used it so I cannot return it.  We had a similar one at work that I like but I can't get the Sizzling noise to turn off now.  Stay away from this one.  i tried attaching video so you can hear noise ...will only take pictures
"September 10, 2018",jas,5.0,,"This coffee maker is a great way to not have to deal with a dripping carafe pitcher.  ""Bold"" feature is one I appreciate since I really like strong coffee.  It's fun to have coffee by just pushing the mug against the rectangular button."
"June 22, 2011",Gemsfreak,5.0,7,"I made sure I read all the reviews about this model before purchasing.  I was hesitant only because so many other reviews mentioned missing their cups with coffee splasing against the back and other places due to the placement of the spout.  What size cut do these people use?  I have not had one mishap with any cup or mug used to get a great tasting, hot cup of coffee each and every day!  The sleek design is perfect for that updated look, the timer is easy to use,and the keep hot option to select 1 to 4 hours is a new option my older brewmaster did not have. I would recommend this coffeemaker to anyone who, like me, is finally replacing an older version of the Hamilton Beach Brewmaster and beyond that, to anyone who is tired of broken and stained decanters.  I hope you like your new coffeemaker as much as I love mine!"
"December 18, 2017",Matt,5.0,,Always brews great coffee! I’m kind of fussy about my coffee and this is so easy to use and clean. We even have friends who come over in the morning just to have some of our coffee!
"July 9, 2019",Nadine,5.0,,Omg I have had real expensive coffe makers but I love this one way more. This coffee maker is what I needed in my life.
"December 28, 2019",Piggly Boy,5.0,,I like dispensing of coffee.
"March 15, 2019",Scarlet C.,2.0,,"Coffee is not hot, would not buy it again. very disappointed."
"February 26, 2013",Milton L. Iossi,2.0,,"After happily using an earlier version of the Brewstation for many years, it finally gave out and we immediately ordered this new one through Amazon. The new version is poorly designed, in our opinion, and is very messy to use. Because the basket and drip container are  shaped like bat-wings, or something, they catch on things and drip water all over the place. When you clean the drippings up, you are likely to snag the bottom drip tray and it goes flying to the floor. All in all, a poor redesign of an excellent product. Maybe the designers had esthetics in or something mind, but they totally overlooked ease of use. Hamilton Beach might want to take another look at this and have some actual tests of ease of use. We loved the old Brewstation."
"January 5, 2015",Lor,5.0,,"I Think this is the best coffee pot ever. We have the perpetual pot of coffee on every day. This keeps the coffee hot while never burning. It has a long shutoff timer on it so when I go back the pot hasn't already turned off, and I don't have to deal with a glass pot breaking every once in a while. I bought 2 one for home and one for the camper."
"March 21, 2021",James,3.0,,"This is my third brew station and by far the noisiest. After brewing it continues to gurgle and kinda sizzle, it is very annoying, The illuminated dial is bright enough to read by. It illuminates my kitchen at night, it is unreal this crazy bright blue light."
"March 22, 2020",diamondsinparis,1.0,,"Noisiest coffee machine ever!,,!,,!!"
"March 18, 2017",onikama,5.0,,"This coffee machine is absolutely the best. I use it nearly every morning, and it brews automatically the time I wake up so a hot cup is waiting for me. Easy to clean, easy to use and an essential in your kitchen. Great performance and a cheap price? Love it!"
"December 28, 2020",ruth speed,1.0,,Have had coffee makers from this manufacturer before but was VERY disappointed in this model. This thing leaked like seive. I sent it back and replaced it with one from Mr Coffee.
"February 11, 2015",Gail M. Petrucci,5.0,,When I visited my cousins summer 2014 they had one of these and the coffee was always really good in the morning.  When my current coffee maker by Krups stopped working I bought this Hamilton Beach 48464.  Coffee is great and now I don't have the need for a separate carafe so the coffee doesn't burn.  This is a really nice all in one unit.
"February 8, 2016",G. Shelton,4.0,,"Great, but.... There's no way to dim the light, no audible tone to alert you that the coffee is ready and I recently set the auto brew and found the light on the next day but no coffee.  It took me a few minutes to determine that the pot displayed the clean message over night and ignored the brew time.  I was not happy."
"March 24, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Superb product for the $$, this is the second one , the first is in the RV , this particular model is updated as newer models usually are, however, they fixed a lot of annoying little things like drainage issues into the lower heating element area and the flapper you push on to let the coffee pour out and into your cup. Best bang for the buck in my opinion!!!"
"November 23, 2016",S. Amen,5.0,,"I love this coffeemaker. The lack of a removable carafe hasn't really presented any problems. The only minor annoyance is filling up larger mugs that don't quite fit under the dispenser. I love making iced coffee with this in the summer. Hot or cold, the coffee tastes great."
"June 5, 2019",Donald Whitaker,5.0,,Good product
"December 15, 2019",Crystal C,5.0,,I love this coffee maker and I love not having a carafe even more!!
"June 11, 2021",Cat lover,3.0,,"Like no carafe, but has leaked when pouring down front of machine since purchased."
"July 23, 2020",Melodie Lewis,2.0,,Only lasted 4 month.
"May 5, 2017",Toni,5.0,One,"The best coffeemaker out there!  I have been using this coffeemaker for years now, every day, sometimes several times per day.  It is a work horse.  When I finally wear it out, I buy an new one exactly like it.  That says a lot for me because I normally like to try different things all the time, but NEVER mess with my coffeemaker!"
"June 25, 2021",Louise Kautenburg,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot.  I can make just the amount I want. coffee never has that ""burnt "" taste.  Attractive to look at, and easy to use.  I haven't had to use the ""clean"" feature yet, but so far this is the best coffee pot/server I've ever had, and this is coming from a ""senior"" citizen."
"February 20, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Great machine!
"May 7, 2014",DG,4.0,,"I really like this coffee maker and the concept of having it dispense one cup at a time.  Here are a few design issues i would suggest if i was in their product development area:  It is difficult to see the coffee level as you are filling the cup - some sort of light would eliminate this issue; when you are through drinking the coffee and want to dump the grounds the condensation from the top/lid drips all over the counter in back of the maker; also, the coffee filter holder collects condensation and drips coffee all the way to the trash can.  You have to remove this filter holder to empty the coffee reservoir.  These are inconveniences that could be reengineered - not major issues."
"August 3, 2014",Rik L. Hix,5.0,,"Love this coffee pot!  They've improved significantly with the removable water container.  So much easier to fill than in past models. Have to give major kudos to the delivery team, I ordered this on Friday and it was delivered to my door on Sunday morning!!!  Unbelievable, I was not expecting this item until Monday.  Exceptional job and this is why I will always be a prime member!"
"February 15, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,I love the coffee pot only exception is when you put your cup under to fill it coffee leaks out down the back of the pot where the button is. We sent first one back for the same thing and second one does it too.  Old style was so much better.
"November 27, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,The Lid for the water reservoir broke off.  I have to now order another water reservoir- And the lid to the coffee container keeps popping off as if the snap is not grabbing the fastener tight enough
"January 15, 2017",Alan,2.0,One,"It was great while it lasted, about 6 months!  As with so many other reviews here, the seals failed and half of the coffee would end up back in the fresh water tank.  Boo."
"June 25, 2017",Evelyn P.,5.0,,This is our 3rd or 4th Brew Station over the years - we use the every day.  I love the redesign with the integrated water tank - it's sleeker looking and takes up less room on the counter.  It makes a great cup of coffee.
"February 13, 2021",Katie Hutsen,3.0,,"This coffee maker leaks like crazy!!! We had the old style with the side water compartment and we loved it. When it finally stopped working, we decided to try the new style and we HATE it. It’s not the same. Stick with the one with the water reservoir on the side and you will be much happier!!"
"March 23, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I liked this coffee maker until it leaked all over my counter. It lasted 3 months and 3 weeks. The part that holds the brewed coffee started leaking, it is not fixable. I would look elsewhere, this thing is junk."
"June 28, 2020",Swarovski lover,3.0,,Coffee Pot does not get the coffee very hot!!!
"October 21, 2016",TexasTornado,5.0,,I ordered this to replace the other one that finally bit the dust.  Same exact coffee maker. I'm glad I found it here and at a nice price. I've learned that your coffee maker really should be cleaned/descaled at least once a month to make it last longer. Lesson learned.
"October 10, 2016",Bo bell,5.0,One,"The best coffee maker eliminating a need for a carafe. Keeps coffee hot for 4 hrs , automatic turn ogg, bold feature option."
"January 2, 2014",LAM,5.0,,"While not as fancy as some other coffee makers I have loved the Hamilton Beach Brew Station makers since  my first one years ago. The removable water tower makes setting up the water so easy.  I use a gold filter which fist perfectly in the basket, and to be able to program my coffee the night before and have it ready when I wake up first thing in the morning is the best.  I admit I like it just a tad more than my Keurig."
"June 3, 2018",Patrick Ackerman,5.0,,This must be the 5th one if these I bought. They are great. They don't last more than 2 or three years. But what does.  I always buy the little filters to filter the water before it goes in. Would (and have) buy again
"October 5, 2011",Denno,5.0,One,"We had the 'original' type Brewstation for the past four years, and my only problem was when I poured sometimes the position of the coffee tank crimped the hose supplying the poured coffee. Since we had the new Brewstation, I am pleased at the way it performs. Makes a good cup of coffee, and fills a cup swiftly every time. I was concerned about some comments on here about the spillage issue when pouring, but I haven't encountered that problem even once."
"May 13, 2018",Bob Plouvier,3.0,,"Was not packed well arrived broken at the bottom but works well, that is why 3 stars"
"October 1, 2019",Kristy Jeffords,1.0,,First day we used it and it leaked all over the counter. Returned it the next day. I was so excited about this coffee maker!
"February 7, 2018",Teresa R.,5.0,,I absolutely love Hamilton Beach and their coffee makers! I have one I purchased 12 years ago that worked until the o-ring finally went kaput! This is the updated model and I love it! Great products!
"January 25, 2015",Stefanee Escay,5.0,One,"We LOVE this coffee maker! It's hassle-free to add water to the side container when you want to brew an entire pot, and it dispenses a fresh, hot cup of coffee without a mess every time. I was actually excited when our old coffee pot finally gave up because I've been wanting this BrewStation for quite sometime. Definitely worth the price... and the shipping is extremely fast."
"February 29, 2020",Amanda Hardy,5.0,,Love the ease of this coffee machine! Set it up for now or delay set for later! Keep it warm for up to 4 hours! Makes my life easy with me working days and hubby working nights. I make a pot when I get up in the morning and enjoy and leave the rest on warm for when he wakes up.
"January 13, 2020",Regina Taylor,4.0,,Very pleased with it.
"April 16, 2018",Bill C,5.0,,This coffee maker beats the devil out of others I have had. Makes good coffee - easy to fill - light enough to move around with problems.
"December 12, 2016",Carl Cleveland,5.0,,"Last one lasted a couple of years which is better than most coffee makers we have had. It still made the coffee but the warmer quit working. This works great, has coffee ready when we get up each morning and keeps it warm as long as we need.  They are getting harder to find in stores so I'm ordering another as a backup."
"June 13, 2016",Steve,5.0,,We really like and enjoy this machine. No glass container to wash and break. We have purchased 4 of them. The last one for our daughter for Xmas.  The valve that lets the coffee run into your glass got to not working  on our last one. The pivot wore out . It still worked but the coffee dispensed slower.  I will keep buying as long as they are available.
"September 30, 2016",Amazon Shopper,5.0,One,"I bought this to retire the newer model with the removable water tank on the side, which suffers from water ponding inside the coffee maker.  I have had two other of this particular coffee maker and absolutely love it and the coffee it brews.  I hope it continues to be available."
"July 20, 2019",Steven Rich,4.0,,"I just like the fact there is no carafe to drop and break with hot coffee. It has all the programming options one could need and real simple to master in two pots worth. I like the design for it's simplicity of use. I've only had it for a few days so, if anything crops up, I'll chime in again. I like it, I like it allot."
"June 11, 2019",samantha williams,5.0,,I ordered this is a replacement for the same product I purchase several years ago. Love the improvement with these side water container.
"December 25, 2020",Kate Doman,3.0,,It leaks
"June 21, 2019",Kindle Customer,5.0,,This is perfect for either a travel mug or your mug at home.  Easy to operate and makes fabulous coffee quickly! If you have hard water I recommend ordering the water filters to go with it.
"July 23, 2013",Deborah Daniel,5.0,,"I was so skeptical of a holding tank that would actually keep coffee hot for a length of time.  I can say I am more than pleased with this coffee maker.  It's easy to use, the timer feature is great and the brew style feature.  So many features, and all they work as stated!!  This is just the best!!  One funny note....on more than one occasion I have reached for the handle of the carafe (that's not there!) I guess old habits die hard."
"July 23, 2013",Tommy Gene Smith,5.0,,"This was my second Hamilton Beach coffee maker, my original lasted 8 yrs and when I saw this new looking one, I didn't hesitate to buy it.  All the reviews I read had me wondering about it but I don't understand the problem people were having.  I plugged it in programmed it set the start time for the morning brew and everything worked.  It makes a better cup of coffee than my original pot.  Its a great product and the price can't be beat, I love it"
"September 30, 2020",Kindle Customer,1.0,,"I have had three of these and they all broke the same way.  The tab you push to dispense the coffee stops working.  I only bought one the other two were warranty replacements, it's a design flaw.  I would not buy this again."
"March 22, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"This was a replacement of the same coffeemaker, which we had for 2 or 3 years.  It’s very easy to program so the coffee is ready when we get up in the morning.  This is the third one of this model that we’ve had the past several years so obviously we like it."
"September 25, 2018",kbs,4.0,,"The water tank seems to lean a bit and doesn't have a nice finished look when attached to the coffee maker, but it functions as it should."
"February 16, 2017",Laine Agee,1.0,,"I bought this coffee maker to replace one I bought 12 years ago. The old one worked great, but some of the parts wore out. This one is awful. I set the timer every night to have coffee ready in the morning. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. This morning the light to make coffee was on, but the water never ran through. Other times the water doesn't touch all the coffee and I get pale water. This updated model is much worse than the one I had before."
"June 12, 2014",Kathryn,5.0,One,"This is about the 4th or 5th one I've worn out.  We use ours all day long, every day.  This time around, I bought 2.  One for regular and one for decaf.  Since we have very hard water here, you do have to stay on the vinegar cleanse program...but totally worth it to not have to worry about drippy, spilly, and breakable carafes and the burnt coffee that always lurks at the bottem of the pot!"
"June 7, 2016",Pam (Chicago),4.0,One,"Only reason I took off a star was because the top plastic part can get extremely hot which can't be good for you. Also, an improvement could be for the button you have to apply pressure to for the coffee to pour, be activated on a light toggle instead of having to press against it the entire time. Just my opinion"
"January 9, 2019",gardens happen,1.0,,The coffee maker is supposed to hold 12 cups of water. It only holds 11 cups. Disappointing. We liked the feature of keeping hot for 4 hours.  That's just ok.  After an hour or so the coffee is not as hot.  It is also not that well made.  The water reservoir does not attach well.  I liked my Cusinart much better.
"December 30, 2019",Courtney M.,5.0,,I got so many more features than I thought with this. Designed really well- they definitely  paid attention to the detail. My coffee lover packed up the old coffee maker and put it in the garage as soon as this one was plugged in
"February 15, 2020",B Ward,1.0,,"This coffee maker was working fine as it is easy to fill with water and make coffee, but after 3 months of use the top does not go on all the way now and it is leaking everytime I make coffee. It is leaking by the top cover where the lever that holds the removable top in place.  Disappointing."
"April 27, 2017",Jessica Smith,1.0,One,"Hard to thoroughly clean. Won't fit medium to large coffee cups, so you have to pull it away from the counter and tilt the cup. Can't see what you're pouring so have to guess to not overfill. Can't turn it back on to warm coffee unless you put more water in it. Getting ANOTHER new coffee maker because this one does not work for us."
"July 6, 2021",Christy Brown,1.0,,Broke 32 days later
"September 18, 2017",Christy Lynn,5.0,,"I have had this item a while, forgot to leave feedback, its still working wonderfully and if it ever quits, I will just buy another one, love it"
"April 10, 2019",sharon,5.0,,Had about one month and absolutely love it. No more glass pots to break . very easy to use.
"January 5, 2021",Lynne Suppes,1.0,,Leaked and returned it
"March 25, 2021",Jodi,4.0,,I like the features... but cleaning it is a bit awkward
"January 25, 2021",Jean,1.0,,"My second brew station.  First one lasted less than 3 years, then dispenser clogged despite having been regularly cleane according to mfgr.  Second one leaks coffee during every brewing cycle leaving streaks all over counter.  There will be no third.  Do not recommend"
"January 3, 2014",Mary G.,5.0,,"The pause and brew designs on the coffee makers has really caused me quite a headache! If you don't get the carafe positioned just right the coffee brews everywhere BUT in the carafe. Not a great way to start a morning! Forget all of that!!! This brewer is spot on! No mess, no fuss, no headache! It brews rather quickly. The taste is nice and there are multiple brew strength settings if you like weaker or stronger coffee. Now my mornings always start with coffee in my cup...not on the counter!"
"November 9, 2018",Martine,2.0,,"I purchased this coffee maker because it offered no carafe and it would keep the coffee hot.  However, it's not that easy to use.  You must first remove the filter basket and the water basket, fill the water basket to your desired quantity then pour the water into the tank.  It's a watery mess!!.  If you like hot coffee this will not keep it hot enough.  I had to microwave my cup for hot coffee.  I went back to the standard coffee maker with carafe."
"May 5, 2020",Amber,3.0,,The thing that I don’t like about this coffee pot is that I feel like the coffee doesn’t stay as hot. Even though you can keep it warm for up to 4 hours I just feel as if my coffee would never be as hot as my old coffee pot.
"September 4, 2020",Michelle C.,5.0,,I love this coffee pot. Highly recommended
"March 15, 2021",Pamela Stancil,5.0,,"This is my favorite coffeemaker of all time! Keeps the coffee hot, it tastes wonderful, and it is so easy to clean!"
"October 18, 2020",Becky Madden,5.0,,"Easy to set up, cleaning takes minutes and it great that it keeps coffee warm up to four hours if need be!"
"January 9, 2017",Jerry Hiatt,1.0,,Good concept but really bad product. Slides all over the counter you have to put you hand on top and push the cup and it pretty warm. You would think they could do something a simple as putting sand in the bottom for weight. I hate putting down on a product but this thing is bad.
"July 21, 2016",Dave,5.0,,A lot of people put this coffee maker down. They talked about how the spout was too far back and the coffee didn't go into their cups and it spilled everywhere.  Those people just need new cups. I love this thing and if it breaks in a year I'll buy another one. Programmable and very easy to use. Directions are easy to follow.
"November 26, 2019",Bizgirl07,4.0,,Wished I had gotten the Flex one for my Keurig Pods and one cup!
"April 21, 2020",Customer,1.0,,"Used the brewstation to make coffee three times total since I got it, now it’s beeping constantly saying “pour water” even though the reservoir is full. Emptied it and refilled it, turned it off and back on. It will not work now. This is a poor quality product."
"July 7, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,This product is easy to use easy to put water and easy to put garbage in and it’s easy to clean  The problem with it Is it quits percolating and you have to turn it off and on several times to get a complete pot 12 cups of brewed coffee
"December 8, 2019",Glora E. Wingate,3.0,,"The only thing we really don't like about this coffee maker, is that it is so lightweight that you have to hold onto while you are filling your cup.  Otherwise the whole unit moves backwards when you push against the lever to fill your coffee."
"November 10, 2018",Kristy Nichols,5.0,,Wonderful machine! My dad loves his coffee and can now just make it by cup and not waste it anymore.
"December 30, 2018",Judy Rowe,5.0,,I actually bought this for a friend in Tennessee for her birthday but her son bought her one just like the one I ordered so she told me to keep it and use it I did it's great mmakes great coffee don't have to clean the pot
"March 3, 2021",Shelley R. Quartiero,1.0,,"This product is AWFUL.  When getting a cup of coffee, it runs all over.  We have taken it apart, cleaned it with vinegar but it stills goes every where.  Will be looking for another new coffee maker and NOT Hamilton Beach"
"August 31, 2011",Olie,2.0,,"Purchased in October 2010. Worked as advertised but I noticed the red LED indicator burned realy bright and that is usually a sign that it will burn out and three months later it did. The unit still worked but in June the green indicator joined it. July it would no longer keep the coffee hot. August, total crap out. The coffee was never real hot and the setup itself is a little cumbersom. My suggestion, look for a good stainless carafe unit."
"December 22, 2019",john la,5.0,,Works as you'd expect. Very good and easy to use.
"October 6, 2016",Sterling Holden,5.0,,"As a coffee novice, I didn't realize coffee could taste so good.  I like the convenience of this coffee maker and the fact that, according to the description, ""- all parts that come into contact with coffee and water are BPA free.""  Consequently, I've divorced Mr.Coffee and kicked his twelve cup butt out the door."
"August 19, 2016",Elizabeth M. Walker,5.0,,I have had several Hamilton Beaches over the years but this model is my favorite.  The water delivery system is excellent.  It is easy to clean and as with Hamilton Beach it makes a great cup of coffee.  No pouring.  Just put your cup against the button and coffee is delivered to your cup.
"September 24, 2019",virginia,1.0,,Coffee drips after pushing button to dispense coffee. Water leaks from steam produced inside maker. So much condensation that when you dump your grounds water is dripping from basket. When you dispense your coffee the machine backs up so you need to have it against the wall. Little legs on bottom keep coming off. Horrible maker.
"July 1, 2016",Gypsy Wife,5.0,2,Hamilton Beach makes very high quality products. We have bought and worn out many over the years. We are very pleased with this coffee maker. Easy to fill and clean. No messy spills from carafes that drip. No broken glass carafes. Coffee tastes great.
"December 10, 2019",konrad kersten,5.0,,Great coffee maker would buy again
"March 30, 2020",Plain Jane,1.0,,2 months since we began using it and it leaks coffee all over the counter. I discover it’s because the coffee leaks out of the reservoir and drips through the hole in the base. Can’t use this any more and the return window has closed. My bad.
"June 27, 2016",Linda Hays,5.0,,"this is my third one, it's the only coffee maker that has the recommended high temp to get the most out of your coffee. I drink a lot of coffee and when I serve coffee to friends, I get compliments...Some of those friends and family have also purchased this coffee maker and are loving it as well."
"August 12, 2019",Sandra,5.0,,This is my favorite apparatus to use when guests or larger number of coffee cups need to be made. We normally use a French Press but this is great as well. The best part is it is easy to use and it does not have glass parts to replace if broken.
"March 19, 2017",C. Daby,2.0,,The coffee tastes fine but....here are my gripes.  1.  It takes too long to brew.  2.  It takes too long to fill your cup or travel mug.  3.  There's no way to tell where the coffee is in the cup so it can overflow on your hand (I got burned one morning!)  It takes a lot of patience to own this machine and I usually don't have patience in the morning!  Not worth it:(
"July 4, 2020",Deb Lent,5.0,,Great coffee machine! Coffee stay REALLY hot for 4hrs and doesn't taste burned. Only drawback is the spot where the coffee comes out dribbles down the front of the machine.
"May 18, 2021",Mauricio Batres,5.0,,Love it
"December 8, 2019",DL Norton,5.0,,Great price and great coffee maker
"March 3, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love having coffee on tap. It's so simple to use and program start times. You can also set how long you want it to keep your coffee warm and not worry that you left the pot still burning. I'm so glad I decided to buy this coffee maker instead of the classic style.
"January 1, 2020",B,2.0,,We have had 2 of these coffee makers and both have leaked. The second one leaks so bad that coffee ends up all over the counter and floor unless we lay a towel under it.  Will NOT order another!!
"January 23, 2014",Rebecca Simmons,5.0,,I love it. My husband I share a pot of coffee in the morning. I get my cup and leave the rest for him. It smells and it keeps hot. He can't smell it but to me it burns as the day goes on. With the new Hamilton Beach Brew Station I can make a pot and I set it to cut off in two hours. He can come back and push the on button and it will heat the coffee on the spot. I love it. Best coffee pot ever.
"December 11, 2020",Iralene Sue Forfner-Nehls,2.0,One,It leaks.  2nd. one same as the first. 3rd bought elsewhere.
"May 26, 2021",Domingo Rodriguez,5.0,,Good
"July 2, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,This coffee pot is the worst. The only way it works is for four cups. Too much of a bother to return. I had much.better luck w9th simpler and cheaper coffee machines. I sure got a lemon.
"June 2, 2013",Richmond Kid,4.0,,"I prefer a dispenser coffeemaker without a carafe.  I like this one because it is tall enough to fill travel mugs and you can actually see the level in the cup as it rises.  Coffee is good and it is isn't too difficult to pour water in and load the coffee.  It does drip quite a bit when you open it to clean it, but doing it slowly with a paper towel works fine and I'm not sure any other one doesn't do the same thing."
"September 22, 2018",bonnie mckibbin,5.0,,"I had one of these before, and loved it!! So when i found it on Amazon prime i bought it. Its so easy to use and eady to clean."
"May 20, 2021",Lois Liedtke,1.0,,Ordered this a month ago. Within a week it was leaking! Will never buy another Hamilton Beach. Totally cheap junk. Unfortunately I discarded the box or would return.
"November 12, 2019",Kristina,5.0,,"We have busted many glass carafes and it's always been a frustrating purchase to replace! This item doesn't have a carafe, just a removable water container. Love it!"
"November 21, 2019",Jim Giammarco,5.0,,The first one we received was totally damaged. But Amazon replaced it quickly. This coffee maker is an excellent value for the money
"June 9, 2021",Krystal,1.0,,It leaks everywhere. We took this camping with us and I bought it for our camper thinking it would be perfect. Well it made the coffee but with in 30 minutes of it staying on warm it leaked all down counter and drawers of my brand new camper multiple times. 🤬🤬🤬
"August 23, 2019",Pamela C.,4.0,,The quality of workmanship is lacking. The materials are more flimsy than the pot we had before which was a Hamilton beach too. But not unlike the way pretty much everything is made today. Pay more get less. It works just fine though.
"August 1, 2019",pam,5.0,,we use this one at our office.  Really is nice.  So easy to use.
"February 6, 2021",Patricia L.,1.0,,"The coffee maker makes good coffee, but it has leaked from the beginning.  I am getting a different one barely 2 months after purchasing."
"November 10, 2017",Staci Kovalchuk,4.0,,"Easy to use, keeps coffee warm and doesn't take too long to make all 12 cups! It's also amazing for people who can't wait for coffee to finish because of the dispenser you can access your coffee before the rest of the pot is brewed without waisting and of the precious gold."
"September 8, 2016",K. Knox,5.0,One,I love this coffee maker! The best part is that the coffee stays so hot! Down fall is it is a bit messy getting water into the machine.  Otherwise love it!
"May 27, 2016",Nancy B,5.0,,Very happy with this purchase.  I love the convenience of making only one to four cups in the morning and having hotter coffee than I was getting with my other coffee makers.  My daughters love it for the ice coffee it makes.
"February 4, 2017",Heidi L. Vaughters,5.0,3,"Love this coffee maker! I was hesitant after reading some negative reviews regarding the spout and it not being far out enough.  I was afraid coffee would be spilling by hitting the lip of the mug but that's simply not the case. Easy to program, easy to use and no annoying carafe to worry about!"
"December 3, 2019",Pati Threatt,2.0,,"I bought this coffee maker 7 months ago. It did not fit underneath my counter, but I used it anyway. This week it went crazy. Turning on and off for no reason. Beeping incessantly for no reason. Now I have to get a new coffee maker."
"December 8, 2020",Dan Hill,2.0,,I've used my pot about 6 times and it leaks all over the counter. I dont have the box anymore but would like a replacement.
"August 24, 2019",DavidK,5.0,,Coffee is great very convenient
"July 5, 2020",Gwen Roulx,1.0,,We purchased this coffee pot in May.  We have had several of the same kind.  We like it because we can program the night before and have our coffee waiting for us in the morning.  We have only had this for 2 months and the programming button will not worked.  Very disappointed.
"February 14, 2021",Irene,3.0,,"Great coffee maker; love that I don't have to deal with a carafe. But it dribbles from various places: at the push bar, underneath the machine, under the coffee holder. Frustrating."
"November 12, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Love this style of coffee pot,  its a big improvement over the first one i had."
"December 31, 2018",Dawn,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker.  It is so easy to use, and gives instructions how to make ice coffee.  I love that it keeps the coffee warm for the time you choose and it does not burn the coffee.  Only down side is it should be a bit taller for large travel mugs"
"May 10, 2016",Tampa Pool Pro,5.0,,"Love!  Love!  Love this Coffe Maker!  They only last 2 or 3 years, but we love this coffee maker!  No carafe!  First one dropped and cracked housing. Second one lasted 22 months before it started leaking inside the housing--because we literally use it for hard Cuban Espresso Cofree twice daily!"
"August 17, 2019",Sandra H.,5.0,,"This coffeemaker has great quality, easy to use and clean. It works well for brewing multiple cups of coffee. Highly recommend!!"
"December 12, 2019",Sabrina Kay,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. It is easy to use and clean. Great product for the price.
"April 20, 2016",Poppycock,4.0,,"There should be a little light up top where you push the lever to dispense the coffee.  If the inside of your mug is a dark color you may misjudge and end up with coffee all over your hand and counter.  All in all it a good little pot, everything works, makes a good cup of coffee."
"February 28, 2020",Rain Thompson,1.0,,The lever that you push to get coffee is not built well at all. It will pop in and you can not get coffee out. We had a Hampton Beach coffee pot very similar to this on for over 10 years and loved it. This product is not made to the same standard. DO NOT BUY IT!
"April 26, 2016",Marina,5.0,,My son had one of these when I went to visit him. Love that you don't have to mess with a carafe. You can set it for 2 up to 12 cups of coffee and can also adjust how long you want it to stay on. Makes a great cup of coffee and haven't had an issues with it. Love it.
"September 9, 2019",Samantha Murphy,5.0,,I love this coffee pot. My old coffee pot was the older version of this but I just wanted to upgrade to the newest version. So easy to clean and easy to get my coffee in the morning with the self timer.
"December 29, 2019",California,5.0,,Makes great coffee
"September 28, 2020",Horace blackledge,2.0,,After brewing my first pot of coffee it leaked down into the warmer and continued to try and percolate after the water was gone. Tried emailing customer support and still haven't heard anything. Not a happy customer.
"April 17, 2021",Shelley Arnold,3.0,,This is my second one..older one had water well outside and I liked that better. Also this new one leaks and the older on didn't.
"May 7, 2014",LadyBoots,4.0,,"Makes good coffee. I use the 3 hour keep warm feature,and it has not affected the taste. It does warn you when to clean the coffeemaker, which I have. The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does leak down the front on the very last cup of coffee. Other than that I would have given it 4.5 stars and keep something handy to catch the leak."
"May 6, 2021",Clara Knox,5.0,,Like the ability to make as many cups as you want
"October 20, 2016",Teh Pickle Jar,5.0,One,We wanted a coffee maker that wouldn't potentially be a burn-hazard for a 3.5 year old. This does the trick. Makes plenty of coffee and just the right amount of settings for a basic machine. Definitely a great way to keep hot coffee away from curious hands.
"October 7, 2018",Tippy,5.0,,This coffee maker works like a charm. Good value for your money too!
"May 24, 2014",Jon K.,5.0,One,"excellent product, I have had multiple strokes and I can grasp the bucket and fill with ease, I like the push button in the front for cups, just wish there was a light on the front to see when the coffee was full in my cup otherwise a great coffee maker, this replaced another Brewstation I had for almost 10 years and was still working but I dropped the bucket and broke the handle, my fault"
"March 5, 2018",Andyroo,2.0,,"It's makes coffee fine, but it's awkward to load water into. Also when you need to leave it open to dry, there are two different compartments you have to remove just to do that. Not recommend overall."
"December 11, 2016",Shirley Lentz,3.0,,"love the concept of this coffee maker. This is my 4th one. Every 6 months (even if you clean it) there is a problem and I have to get another one. Really not happy about that, but have not een able to find any others that work like this. Anyone have a suggestion, I would appreciate it."
"January 11, 2021",Christopher Sharkey,2.0,,I like the idea of not having a carafe to clean or break.  This coffee maker leaks coffee after the cup is removed.  I have returned for a replacement.  The issue is the same with the replacement.  I will look for another brand when I shop for a coffeemaker without a carafe.
"July 9, 2018",D. R. Hyde,5.0,One,"I have had this coffee maker for over 2 years now, used it daily and I still love it. No more carafe to worry about, nothing to break, easy to clean, easy to use, doesn't take up much counter space. The only ""negative"" thing I can say is after about 2.5 years, the coffee may not stay quite as hot, but I can't say for sure. When I have to replace, I will definitely buy another one."
"January 25, 2016",M. Miller,5.0,,This is my second brew station and it's even better than the last one I had. So much easier to see the number of cups when adding water. The chamber that holds the coffee and the coffee basket are so much easier to insert. I highly recommend it.
"March 9, 2020",Claire Crain,2.0,,Very flimsy lid. Works well. Keeps coffee warm in dispenser.
"May 4, 2018",Laura,1.0,6,Stopped brewing a full pot after 1 1/2 months.  Would only brew 4 to 6 cups at a time no matter that the water tank was full for 12 cups.  Nothing solved the issue.  Amazon let me return the item but charged me a 20% restocking fee.  This does not make sense to me since the item was defective.  I should not have had to pay a restocking fee for a broken item.
"August 7, 2020",Michele Salazar,1.0,,Move for this product would be 10/10 IF every time you go to get coffee it didn’t leak everywhere!!!  We’ve tried everything we can think of but it seems to be something is too short (?) to completely block the valve when you press the button.  Other than that LOVE LOVE LOVE this little sleek machine
"July 3, 2020",aponce,5.0,,I have this same coffee machine & bought it as a gift.  They loved it!  No glass carafe to break!
"August 30, 2016",mcguppy,5.0,,"This coffee maker is great, it has lots of features like extending the warmer to keep you coffee hot, makes very good coffee and even does single cups, the basket is drippy when taking it out to empty , so you need to put it on a towel or dish, the coffee maker is quiet and quick, it also brews ice coffee or tea as well."
"May 3, 2016",Nika Hezebicks,3.0,,"For the first 9 months it was great! It started leaking after that, i've cleaned it, still leaks. This morning it started making noise!! I thought it was my fridge going but it was the coffee pot!! Beware if you purchase this! I thought with it being a name brand it would hold up longer than a year and 3 months!!!"
"September 4, 2014",mpugh,5.0,,"I had the previous model to this one and I really liked it.  About a year and a half into it, it broke.  I like the small upgrades they have made to this model; like having the water reservoir on the side.  I also like the programmable warming feature.  I've seen other's complaints about the coffee burning or the coffee being weak, but the only way I've found to burn the coffee is if you leave the warmer on when there is a low amount of coffee in the carafe.  As far as weak coffee, just add more or use less water.  I had some out-of-town guests staying with me recently and they commented on how good they thought the coffee was.  I'm definitely happy with this coffee maker."
"March 31, 2017",Barbpoc,3.0,,"Great concept for holding coffee and preforms well. However, it is a noisy machine due to condensation issue falling into the heated bin, so it gurgles and snaps for a few hours when it's on. They are replacing mine due to some issue after working 9 months. Just be aware it'll cost you another $12 to have them send you a new one."
"August 2, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,I like
"March 19, 2014",L. Davidson,5.0,,"This is our 3rd coffee maker like this.  We have been sold on these since we tried the first one.  Love not having the glass pot to deal with.  The inside basket is super easy to use and clean.  We have not experienced any dripping onto the counter when a cup is not being held under it.  Very good quality and you can't beat the price.  Works fast, which is great when you are waiting on that first cup!"
"September 26, 2018",Ashley S.,2.0,,"It is easy to use, and it makes the coffee quickly. But I bought this so I could have a reservoir. If I click 1-4 cups and have a full reservoir, it will use all of the water in it instead of the 1-4 cups."
"June 25, 2016",timothy p walker,4.0,3,"The coffee maker is easy to use and I love that even taller travel mugs can fit under it. I only have two minor complaints. If you set the timer to reheat coffee in the morning, it won't turn on. It will just beep and tell you tao add water. Second, it makes a brewing sound the entire time it's on. Long after the coffee has finished brewing."
"July 5, 2021",Jeanine wiedemann,5.0,,I really like the way you add the water. It is easy to rremove and fill in the sink
"January 30, 2021",David,1.0,,"I've owned three of these Hamilton Beach Brewstation coffee makers previous to this one. The quality had gone down immensely. When pushing the dispenser bar, coffee leaks every where. Very dissatisfied. They really need an upgrade to this product!"
"April 25, 2016",Timothy F. Halloran,2.0,2,"Negatives outweigh the positives especially if taste means anything to you. This is unfortunate because I really like some of the features. Obviously programmability is a plus as is the lack of a carafe. Just push the cup against the front like a soda machine. However, and this really is unfortunate considering that another $5 in materials would resolve this, I can't get past the awful taste of the coffee. The very first cup I made with the machine was actually decent although I felt it was pretty weak despite using the bold option. But once the plastic interior got hot, the second cup was disgustingly plastic tasting (only 20 to 30 minutes later). Subsequent attempts in following days resulted in the same regardless of coffee or heater settings, except that even the first cup started to take on a plastic taste. My wife is less picky than I am and she stopped using the machine after a few days as well. I am guessing that if they were simply willing to put an extra couple bucks of glass or metal in the interior, and charge a few $ more, you'd have a pretty decent coffee maker. Again, the coffee was still not as extracted as I would like but I could live with it if I didn't feel like I was licking a melted plastic lollipop."
"November 28, 2020",elaine lee,5.0,,"Easy to prepare the night before, easy for everyone to just put your cup there and press it and get coffee, do not have to pick up the glass canister and pour. It was recommended to me and I love it. Does not take up much room on the counter. Highly recommend this one."
"December 28, 2016",seethestars,5.0,One,I've owned several of these and I love them. No pot to clean or break. Great coffee maker at a reasonable price!
"January 10, 2018",Mullins,4.0,,Love this coffee maker. Easy to make and dispense one cup at a time. Shipping was questionable. The label was applied to the box. It was not packaged within a shipping box. Was worried it would be damaged but so far so good.
"January 10, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"LOVE this coffee maker. Everyone is impressed by the reservoir style. Easy to keep coffee on-hand, and you can warm it up easily."
"December 4, 2019",T. Monroe,4.0,,Great coffeemaker for the money.  Easier to clean than previous models.  Have to use pour method with spout very carefully though.
"March 8, 2021",Julie,5.0,,It works!
"July 25, 2019",The Wife,3.0,,"Like other reviewers, this does not stay hot at all.  I'm actually returning mine.  The coffee flavor was everything I was hoping for but not luke warm and I don't like microwave coffee.  Going to search for something else."
"June 16, 2021",foxyraqui1021,4.0,,"Very easy to clean, love that it stores inside. My only complaint The coffee doesn't come out very hot once add creamer it's barely warm."
"March 31, 2021",Tamila Adkins,1.0,,"I bought 3 of these, one for myself and 2 for gifts. Mine works great but, 1 of the machines does not brew completely, shuts off too soon, and is an overall disappointment and embarrassing to have given as a gift."
"February 12, 2021",Cliff DeMore,1.0,,This machine is easy to use and makes great coffee. But it leaks all over the counter from the pour spout and top. The mess it makes is ridiculous
"July 6, 2017",Mary E. Alvarado,4.0,,thought  we were getting the same on we had that croaked.  I like the one with the water receptacle on the right side because you can take it to the sink and fill it.  We have to fill this one with a pitcher which we don't like.  Makes good coffee though.
"September 11, 2018",Wirewend,4.0,,"My favorite coffee maker . I tend to break the carafes , this is the one I always look for ."
"July 12, 2021",C. ROSS,5.0,,Bought this one as a gift for a camper friend because we liked ours so much. We mounted it to the counter and don't have to worry about a craft falling off while traveling.
"August 9, 2013",M. Brown,5.0,4,I am not a coffee drinker but my mom is an expert! She needed a new coffee pot but she wanted one without the carafe as she has arthritis and it is hard for her to pick it up. This Brewstation was just perfect! She does not have to deal with handling the carafe. She just puts her cup underneath and fills it up. She is very pleased with this coffee maker.
"June 29, 2018",tessc10,1.0,,two years old and it started to leak somewhere we can't figure out where but coffee brewing was good while it lasted wrote to the manufacturer and never received any help for resolution--
"January 24, 2021",Sue C,2.0,,It leaks coffee onto counter top.  Design flaw
"June 19, 2020",Ginny Bumgardner,1.0,,"This is the THIRD item they sent me...the first one did not work, the second one was the wrong item...not even an equal replacement and the third one does not work either......where are you getting this product from?  the one I got for my friend is fine......."
"April 9, 2020",Donald G.,1.0,,Good idea. Some to-go cups won't fit to fill cup. 2 months later the holding tank started leaking all over the counter. Coffee always seemed to taste burnt.
"June 27, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Love my coffee maker. I've been using over a year now & it works great. I love that the coffee is held within the machine. I often have to describe it to guests as a ""fountain soda machine"" style."
"May 26, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Noisy machine. Returned the first one for loud noises.  Second one not as loud. Still noisy.  Don’t buy. Not worth the money.
"January 24, 2021",Rita w,1.0,,This is not what I thought it would be! It’s leaking from the bottom on my counter! Wish I would’ve stuck with a single serve! Very disappointed!
"December 4, 2020",terry hutcheson,3.0,,It leaks. Love the functions. Don’t like cleaning up the mess it makes because it leaks coffee.
"September 26, 2019",Bettie Meeks,1.0,,"First of all, my fault, I didn’t notice the water holder on the side. The brew station I had before was more streamlined and did not have that hanging on the side.  It sounds like a plane reving up for takeoff!! Noisiest coffee maker I’ve ever owned, and i’ve owned  some!!"
"February 6, 2018",Just Me,5.0,,"It's big, it's klunky, the reservoir is  difficult to fill, and the dispensing unit is not easy to wash. But I love it because, in my opinion,  it brews terrific tasting coffee."
"July 11, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"We have had a coffee pot exactly like this for 10 years before it started leaking!  We ordered and received a new one, which also leaked.  We returned it to Amazon and received another, which works perfectly.  I hope it will last another 10 years for us!"
"January 4, 2018",Teresa RZ,1.0,,I purchased this again after only 2 months only because my 80 yr old mother will only use this particular coffee maker! I find it ridiculous that it only lasted 2 months and simply quit and won't turn on! I am using the same coffee maker that I purchased over 15 yrs ago and I brew a pot twice a day. Wouldn't recommend this one unless you enjoy replacing in less than 3 months use.
"April 17, 2020",Jacob Chavez,4.0,,"Just Received my second brew station . I’m guessing we got our first one round 2004 or 2005. Just had to replace the internal tank which was maybe Two years ago, and now water started leaking at the bottom when leaving overbite for auto start, so had to replace. There is no other one that compares that I know of."
"September 2, 2016",Gilbert P.,5.0,One,"Awesome Full featured and simple to use. Cleaning is easy. Coffee setting of bold is my favorite.  Hamilton Beach is an old, trustworthy name."
"May 12, 2020",Pamela E. Danielson,3.0,,"The coffee maker works well, except you either have to have the pot pushed against a wall or hang on to the back of it to pour coffee.  We won't get another one of these."
"April 29, 2018",Janet Golden,5.0,,Great product.  My husband loves it.  Says it's one of the best coffee machines he's had and he's a big coffee drinker.
"August 31, 2020",Jean Brill,2.0,,Coffee maker quit working after 3 months. Hamilton Beach won't warranty it because it wasn't purchased from them. It was purchased from Amazon.
"November 3, 2019",Ed G Johnson,3.0,,"Average Price, Average Result - kind of like average"
"May 4, 2020",Troy Workman,1.0,,The first one quit working in less than two months. The replacement sent by Hamilton Beach was defective upon arrival.
"June 21, 2018",Bobbie Jo,5.0,,"Just what we were looking for. I read reviews with people saying it had the shortest cord ever and couldn't reach.. I really hope they were kidding as you just need to pull the cord out of the back of the machine. Easy to use, easy to clean."
"January 27, 2020",John,5.0,,Works great better than any other I tried
"December 5, 2014",ET,1.0,2,"Works fine and makes good coffee but it spills water onto the countertop.  There are two little reservoirs next to the heating element which fill with water over time and then spill onto the counter.  The solution is to empty them after each use, which is messy and requires unplugging and then resetting the time etc."
"April 28, 2019",Linda P,1.0,,"This is a piece of junk! It leaked all the time,very cheap.Slides very easily unless you put it against a wall. Seller wanted me to take picture and pay $11.00 to ship back. Never again."
"June 19, 2021",Jesse Silvas,5.0,,Perfect
"March 15, 2017",JJKJr.,5.0,,works great right out of the box easy to use makes good tasting coffee replaces leaking bun machine we like this model no craft  no burnt coffee the tank is a little hard to clean.
"August 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Had one the same style as this one before. This one is a lot easier to use and the coffee stays hot. Great value.
"February 4, 2020",Thomas Wade,5.0,,delivers very  flavorfull coffee and easy to use
"December 16, 2020",Carmen siciliano,5.0,,Easy to use and clean makes a good cup of coffee
"March 9, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Easy dispensing, cleaning and prep.  Do no have any problems with it. This is the 4th one of this type coffee maker and will never go back to a glass carafe!!"
"July 10, 2014",Jim Applebaugh,5.0,One,"Love this thing for making iced coffee. Can't stand it hot! Not as easy as normal coffee since you have to fill half of it with ice & the brewing takes longer but, it works great making it that way. It's just what I wanted. I do wish the fill area was a little bit taller though to make it easier to fill travel cups."
"March 21, 2012",Sarah Baudains,5.0,4,"I bought this for my mother-in-law for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! It's perfect since she drinks so much coffee over a long period of time. (about 7 cups from about 3am to 7am). it keeps the coffee perfectly warm the whole time and lets drink only a cup at a time and holds a lot! Even after she's had her fill, there's still just enough left for my father-in-law to have his morning coffee as well!"
"March 7, 2016",Kim in Ohio,5.0,,"We wanted to get rid of our Keurig. We are tired of spending so much on the K Cups and worried about the plastic K Cups not being safe. It works great and my husband loves that you can smell coffees brewing again. It's large, but compact enough that it doesn't take up too much room. Definitely recommend this coffee pot."
"August 23, 2019",Megan,1.0,,"I’ve had this coffee maker for less than 2 months. The first few times we used it, it was great. However after about the 4th time, it leaks coffee everywhere. I’ve tried everything, smaller pots, but it still ends up leaking coffee all over my counter. Very disappointed because that was the reason i got a new coffee maker, because my old one was leaking, but at least that one lasted over a year."
"June 30, 2021",JB Jacobs,1.0,,I thought my first model must have been defective so I bought a second one. Same issue. It lasts about 2 weeks and starts leaking on my counters
"March 3, 2021",Wayne Hinrichs,1.0,,"I bought the first one and the first cup, coffee ran out of the back of the cup fill. Sent it back and replaced it with another model as the fist. Unit worked fine until the third day and the same problem developed. Sent the second back and got a refund."
"January 26, 2021",Tori,5.0,,Love it so much I bought two of them. I like that it is dishwasher safe. I can keep coffee hot not like the other coffee makers. compact does not take up alot of couinter space.
"August 11, 2019",Charles A. Buchanan,5.0,,Excellent coffee maker. I like the dispenser style.
"December 12, 2013","Tlo, Mom of 2 boys",2.0,One,"Update June 2014:  Less than a year later we had to contact Hamilton Beach because the unit decided one day not to power on.  In the morning it worked fine then in the afternoon it wasn't working, hold onto your receipts, you get a one year warrantee but it takes 7-10 days shipping time and 3-4 days correspondence time and a cost of $9.99 to get them to send a replacement unit to you.  We ended up having to but a different unit before receiving the replacement.  I think these are not made to last, we took good care of out unit.  I will be saving the replacement as a backup because I am starting to prefer the $20 Mr. Coffee old fashioned style unit I has to buy as the Temporary replacement. Original Review August 2013:  This should come with a gold tone reusable coffee filter.  Makes good coffee, keeps it hot.  Love the blue display, makes a good kitchen nightlight.  The iced coffee brewing function is a joke though.  It just says inside the machine where you would never really look to add double the amount of coffee for the amount of water you put and brew regularly. There is no setting for iced coffee.  Nothing any other coffee maker couldn't do.  We do like this way more than a Kuerig, & there are no expensive refills to buy.  Just be careful if you try to brew 12 cups, there is a hole in the back of the machine at the top of the reservoir and if you put too much water in, don't pour carefully or move the machine at all when its full its will leak out of the back.  Also I wish it was a little taller sometimes because its hard to fill the extra tall travel cups.  Not good for use on a countertop with low cabinets (which isn't a personal problem)"
"November 22, 2015",sharstad,4.0,,It makes good coffee and keeps it warm very nicely.  I don't have the problem with the noise others were complaining about.  We have a little issue dispensing with our taller mugs but have found a way to work around it.  A little short mug works wonderful.
"April 7, 2015",Pamela Rojo,5.0,,"I bought this coffee maker for my BFF and she and her father absolutely LOVE IT!  They had one of the older styles of coffee makers. When they made their move from WA State to CA it got broken.  She had mentioned a couple of times that she missed it so I started looking for a replacement. I got this one, with MANY MORE FEATURES for less money than she paid for her original one."
"November 12, 2018",Ashley Chaney,3.0,,"At first it was great having no glass carafe, however after about 3 months of use it started leaking everywhere. The dispenser doesn't seal shut so I would come home to coffee all over the counter and it leaks from the water reservoir as well."
"May 6, 2021",Patricia,1.0,,Got this pot on April 4!and it leaks bad and never made 10 cups of coffee. I always get gets my coffee pots from Hamilton. Never had a problem. So I threw the box out. And I got a new one today.
"February 7, 2017",M. Porter,5.0,One,I've had this for a couple of months and LOVE IT!  Coffee stays hot a long time.  And it appears that the issue of having to angle-in your coffee cup to avoid drips from the dispenser seem to have been remedied in the version with the stainless front.  I couldn't be happier with this coffee maker!
"April 23, 2017",Elaine Semmelmann,3.0,,"I took it out of the box, washed it, filled it and started the brew cycle. Then I slid it back under the counter and one of the rubber stoppers that they use for feet came off. It's now tilting like a sad drunken sailor. I don't get why appliances have to use those! They do not slide! I'll come back later and update, but for now my coffee maker and I are a little off balance."
"February 29, 2016",beanmi,5.0,,"I love this coffee maker for so many reasons.  There is no carafe to break, it keeps the coffee hot!  Easy to clean.  This is actually the second one I bought.  I had the first one for some years before my husband dropped and broke it.  Glad to find another."
"August 1, 2018",Amazon Customer,2.0,,Item was much noisier than last product of the same design. It is now Aug. 1st 2018 and we had to purchase a Mr. Coffee maker as the Hamilton Beach product was only making half the amount of coffee and had to be restated each time. I am so disappointed as we have had two others like this and loved them. Will I get a refund????
"December 6, 2016",jjtilly,4.0,,We love this coffee maker on how hot it keeps our coffee. We purchased it from open box this time. The top does not have fit properly to the bottom. We had family visiting and couldn't return it in quick enough. My cousin used open box and had no issues. Not sure if I would use it again.  Don't want the hassel.
"January 21, 2021",donna walker,5.0,,Love this coffee maker. I actually accidentally ordered 2. I bought one for a family member but accidentally bought 2. Instead of sending it back I kept for myself. Love love love. Not disappointed at all
"January 11, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I did alot of research on coffee makers before buying this one, and decided to go with it because I wanted one that would keep my coffee hot but loved the idea of not having a separate carafe to wash everyday, and being able to pour straight into my to go mug. I am really loving it so far. I don't have any problems with it, and it keeps my coffee hot for hours. I also love the look and the push button, kind of resembles a fancy coffee shop machine."
"January 7, 2020",Jen Stiller,2.0,,This coffee maker worked great for the time it worked. I’ve had it less than 1 year and its now broken. The coffee leaks out of the bottom on the counter and there’s a terrible buzzing noise.
"November 2, 2019",Kim smith,5.0,,i love the fact there no glass container
"July 21, 2016",Kate B.,2.0,,"We tried two and they were both terribly loud once they reached the keep warm stage. Also if you're trying to avoid hot plastic this is not the coffee pot for you, as the hot coffee is kept warm in a plastic receptacle."
"December 31, 2018",Melissa Christine Matthews,1.0,,It makes great coffee and I like that I can brews cold. I also love that there is no pot. However after only 3 months it has a very loud electric buzzing noise. I submitted a warranty claim and will update with info.
"October 25, 2016",KINGSLEY TORRU,3.0,One,"This item was suppose to have some form of grip under the coffee machine to stabilize it i.e to keep it from moving when you try to get the coffee, but it came with just one stud , so you have to hold it from behind to push your cup against it so the coffee comes out. I couldn't send it back because I started using it, I felt like I was sent an incomplete coffee maker, but it is what it is."
"December 24, 2019",kenny lambert,4.0,,Water cover came broke but works
"July 3, 2021",Briana D.,2.0,,Super disappointed how messy this pot is!! It constantly leaks and drips when you’re cleaning or making a new pot. Pouring in water causes a mess every time and when cleaning for a new pot it drips the whole way to the sink. Poor planning on this one!!
"September 19, 2018",Michael,5.0,,"I bought this for my dad who has parkinsons disease and he doesn't have to struggle to handle the carafe. He just has to put his coffee cup under and press it against the button. Its easy to clean, plastic looks a little cheap but I'm sure this will last for a long time."
"October 24, 2017",Chopper,5.0,,Excellent coffee maker that we pull out every time we have house guests. Makes a great cup of coffee and is large enough for when you have guests (or if you just like to drink a lot of coffee!) I would recommend and would definitely purchase again.
"November 11, 2018",sandra cruze,1.0,,I returned my first one hoping it was just a problem or a defect with the one I received. Nope after 6 months the press bar to release coffee gets weakened and leaks. An I mean leaks bad.  To try and clean it or change filter requires a philips screw driver.  So its just got a bad design there.  Hope they get it worked out. But Im going to have to get another coffee maker. Again.
"November 5, 2018",Melissa,1.0,,"The design on this coffee machine is terrible. It leaks water, the coffee temperature is never the same. I have to microwave my cup of coffee sometimes to get it hot enough. It was suppose to be fast brewing but can take up to 10 minutes to get 4 cups brewed. I will be looking for a replacement soon which is a shame since I have had this one for just a few months."
"May 23, 2021",Ann Lowery,2.0,,I have been happy with Hamilton Beach products for years however this product leaked after 15 months. It’s been replaced
"June 16, 2016",Jerry L. Mchenry,4.0,One,Many inprovements over the last model but if you have a big travel cup it still doesn't quite fit when filling.  Last model the dispensor started leaking ( but after a couple years use)  or the inline filter would come loose and stick so you couldn't stop the coffe from coming out
"November 10, 2020",Erik Soell,1.0,,"I loved the older model which I had for 10+ years, but this new design has a lot of leaks that come from the spout and end up all over the counter."
"March 21, 2021",Wendy,4.0,,I was very happy with this coffee maker but now a year later and I had to replace it with a different model. It was used daily and after a year the button that you push the cup against to dispense wore out.
"March 9, 2013",Not as High Maintenance as I Look,1.0,,"I guess I'm lucky this happened the very first time I used it instead of weeks down the road, but it COMPLETELY died mid-brew the very first time I used it.  No amount of unplugging and plugging it back in works.  It's just dead.  I already recycled the box it came in since I EXPECTED IT TO WORK being brand new and all, so hopefully Amazon doesn't hassle me about the return.  What a disappointment."
"May 30, 2016",sja,5.0,,I started drinking coffee off and o in the early 70's.  In the early 90's I became a full fledged coffee drinker and have all the carafes to prove it (I use them to water plants).  It was the heating plate that always went bad.  This HB 12 cup coffee maker solved my issue.  I am so pleased.
"November 15, 2013",island girl,5.0,,"This is the third time in about five years that I've purchased this same coffeemaker - we absolutely LOVE it!  We nearly always have a pot of coffee ready to serve.  This is the best coffeemaker EVER!  I have had way too many over the years to count - but I can say that I've broken many, many glass carafes.  NO MORE CARAFES to look at - and break!!"
"October 25, 2020",Dinnia,1.0,,This coffee pot leaked everywhere. Was not put together well.
"April 25, 2019",Vincent Gervasi,5.0,,Love not having to deal with carafe
"February 4, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is our 5th HB Brew Station..This model has performed the best..I like this because the heating element is right at the spigot so it always takes like the first cup
"May 29, 2017",Stephanie Ortiz,5.0,,The machine it self is a bit clunky compared to a traditional style otherwise it's amazing. You are able to have that fresh brewed taste for hours which is life changing for any coffee addict.
"October 14, 2015",E. T. Houser,3.0,,"There is  a lot that I like and I am generally happy, but I wish it were easier to pour the water into the machine.  I also wish it used a cone filter rather than a basket type.  Maybe in the next iteration. Also, I probably would have given it a four-star rating but I felt that the overall rating was too high so I deferred to three."
"June 21, 2021",Sande Lee,5.0,,"I have been using this coffee pot for years, although upgraded or newer versions. No more breaking the carafes and soooo easy to clean. This will be my 4th one but always keep one as a spare. Can't be without my coffee!"
"October 16, 2012",Charles W. Bradshaw,4.0,,"The Brewstation is everything I expected.  Earlier reviews complained of the coffee going down the back of the cup.  They must have fixed that issue, as there has been no problem with this one. My only complaint about it is that it's noisy in the stay warm mode after brewing. It certainly brews tasty coffee, especially in the BOLD mode. I would recommend it, if a little noise is not bothersome."
"August 26, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"In exactly 4 months from the date of purchase, this coffee maker started leaking all over the counter.  This is my second one.  The first one is about 3 years old and still works fine.  I won't buy it again though.  4 months! Out of the time-frame for returning it."
"April 14, 2021",Lauren Bialkoski,5.0,,"I work from home and drink coffee all day long. This coffee maker did not disappoint. It is so amazing. My husband preps it the night before, and it turns on to brew as our alarms go off. It’s so nice to be able to just grab a cup and hit the lever."
"February 10, 2021",Paige F Styers,2.0,,I like the product generally but it leaks when dispensing and coffee gets all over the counter. This is the third one I have bought. The first two I used for about 2 years before they started leaking but this one has leaked from the start.
"October 26, 2016",Lakeside Denny,3.0,One,"We had a Bunn BT Coffee Brewer, which we loved but after 10 years, it started developing issues.  We decided on this Hamilton Beach unit because it was programmable, somewhat stylish, and a third of the price of a new Bunn BT unit.  After having it for 2 weeks, we have decided to buy another Bunn.  Note that we did not hate the Hamilton Beach.  I think it offers great value and makes a decent cup of coffee but we thought it had a chalky taste (probably because Hamilton Beach uses a plastic container for the hot coffee where the Bunn has a stainless steel carafe).  I also found the plastic feet to keep the HB unit from moving come off far too easily.  Understand that they are there to prevent the unit from sliding as you press your mug against the lever to dispense coffee.  But the unit is tall enough that you can't lift the lid to add water without it hitting your cabinets  So we  move the unit toward the counter edge, add the water and coffee grinds and then move it back under the counter so it's out of the way.  The problem is every time you try to slide it, the rubber feet come off.  You have to physically lift the unit to where you want it.  Putting the feet back on isn't hard but it's a nuisance.  You have to turn the unit on it's side, which you can't do if it's full of coffee. Overall, I think most people will not object to the taste and the unit has many positive features.  My wife loved the fact that it was programmable.  The price makes it very attractive.  You can adjust the brew strength, warm time, and capacity (1-12 Cups).  You can also use it to make ice coffee.  You can even use it to reheat your coffee.  My son just started a new job and getting an apartment so we will probably give him this unit. On the positive side, the unit is easy to program and use.  Directions are clear."
"March 8, 2020",Brent,5.0,,This our second coffee maker this brand. Great coffee and easy to use.
"January 10, 2019",Ann Marie Paola,5.0,,What a pleasure love it as the price worth every penny
"October 17, 2012",D. Smith,5.0,2,"Great sleek style & price. Love the blue backlight. Coffee stays warm with different brewing/shutoff options. Can't be any worse than costly Cuisinart which had to be returned two times. Gave up on the third one. Many people complained about not hearing the ""done brewing"" beep. You know you made coffee, so go get it within five minutes!!"
"September 10, 2019",J D. Bruhn,4.0,,"It fit well on my kitchen counter with cord out of the way and close to the cupboard with the coffee and cups. Obviously, I use it to brew coffee."
"February 12, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,A good coffee maker but water drips from the top into bottom channels. You need to mop the water out of that machine.
"October 16, 2017",Patti,1.0,,I previously reviewed this item with 5 stars but I bought it less than 6 months ago and the heating element has already gone out.
"January 25, 2018",Kindle Customer,1.0,,Wish there was a no star rating; product leaked.  Containers do not seal so could not set pot up in advance for morning coffee. Good design but poor execution
"March 3, 2019",skbs,3.0,,"Good coffee maker.  All the pieces are wobbly and don’t fit together very well.  It works, but just seems like it won’t last long.  Not great quality."
"January 1, 2019",Dan O,5.0,,Love this coffeemaker... makes a great cup and it does a great job keeping coffee warm without burning it.  The potless approach is really nice and it looks sharp.
"February 21, 2019",Patrick Philabaum,1.0,,The carafe drains slowly onto your counter if you don't empty it after use...a few times now I will forget to empty it before leaving for work and come home to a large amount of coffee on the counter. The second issue is the keep warm heater keeps the carafe at a boil which burns the coffee to  a horrible tasting degree by hour 2.
"July 21, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"The coffee is super hot which I love.... but coffee leaks from the bottom of the machine EVERYWHERE! It seems to pool in a reservoir under the bucket that holds the coffee and from there finds its way out of a seem in the bottom. Everytime I think I have fixed it, it happens again- SUPER ANNOYING!"
"March 13, 2016",NCBeach,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. We actually bought two. After we bought the first one, it worked so well we bought one for my sons apartment. Very simple to use, no glass pot to clean or break. Coffee is as good as the brand you put into the machine. Very happy with it."
"March 2, 2020",R. Stephen Jordan,5.0,,Thi is an Awesome Hamilton Beach Product! No glass carafe to worry about breaking Or cleaning Auto features are a Plus as well!
"June 19, 2021",Ronka,5.0,,I do not like this coffie pot at all it leaks coffie out of front all over the place  bad product
"June 27, 2021",Georgia Chronopoulos,5.0,,Love this coffee maker. It replaced my Keurig and is so easy to use and brews my coffee to the best possible flavor! Love using the timer so the coffee is ready in the morning beyond leave for work. 👍🏻
"December 27, 2016",lolo,5.0,One,"I love this coffeemaker!!!!  When guests are over, dispensing the coffee is so much more convenient and I don't have to concern myself with replacing the pot!"
"March 9, 2021",Matthew Yauchler,4.0,,Great product but just wish it was built a little tougher.  When you push on the dispense button the entire thing lifts up since it is made of thin light plastic.
"December 21, 2012",Gregory Fiocca,5.0,,"While cleaning the two compartments prior to brewing coffee, the Brewstation does make the perfect cup of coffee.  It is large and durable with easy to use control buttons.  Easy to set with adjustable hold times and brew settings.  And, it truly does make twelve full cups of coffee, a must for parties and gatherings.  Love this thing.  Easy to clean and I love the push dispense button design.  I like the way it keeps your coffee warm too.  Smart design for sure."
"August 5, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"So far so good, but we have had to replace 2 coffee makers in the last 6 years because they just don't last.  The last was a Black & Decker which we will never buy again.  The only good thing about that one was that it DIDN'T last.  But the Hamilton Beach unit has a very readable digital display and multiple ""keep warm"" temperature settings.  The biggest plus is that the carafe doesn't spill when you pour coffee."
"February 5, 2020",Leticia Swanson,1.0,,Did not last made it 2 months started having issues bought a $20.00 mister coffee at wal mart going strong
"May 17, 2017",douglas j. bayler,1.0,,"You will love love love this thing at first...but give it about 6-12 months and you'll be shopping again. This is our 2nd one of these machines. Each one has ended in leaking and coffee flowing out of spots I didn't even know existed in the machine. So if you want to waste your $$ or love this thing for the short time I did, go ahead and buy it. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
"June 20, 2020",Ariana,3.0,,Started leaking 3 months after purchase.
"September 8, 2017",Kindle Customer,5.0,One,Love that I don't have to have a carafe!  Though this is my second one as the first one conked out after about a year.  Still love it though!
"December 4, 2015",Awesome!,5.0,,"Got it for husband. He loves it. Can be used with average sized thermos, but you must tilt it (so it doesn't fill up all the way). We enjoy not having to clean the pot, works great at heating. And it only drips condensation, when you lift the parts out (for refilling/rinsing)."
"May 23, 2019",Chase Walker,5.0,,"The headline is the review...be careful not to accidentally hit the ""ice coffee"" option...cold coffee in the morning is not the desired outcome."
"November 23, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,My 3rd brew station over the years. This model is cheap and would not turn on few months after I bought.  I called company and turned upside down for model number it lit back up and worked. It is now about 2 more months will not brew.  Cheap version of the old machines I had.
"January 31, 2020",Maggie Mae,1.0,,"Coffee maker leaks around the ""button"" you press to dispense the coffee.  Disappointed as this is the 4th or 5th Hamilton Beach coffee maker  we have purchased.  Pleased enough with the others to purchase another.  Maybe not this time."
"September 23, 2019",Donna Sweeney,1.0,,"I really wanted to like this coffee maker. However, even using the ""Bold"" brew setting the coffee was incredibly weak, nearly tasteless. Returned it."
"June 2, 2021",Aimee Mitchell,5.0,,Love it so easy and no mess
"November 7, 2019",Eboni,5.0,,Love this thing. No more burnt flavor. No more cold coffee. It’s amazing never going to a carafe again
"March 25, 2021",Mary E Lee,5.0,,Bought it for a friend. She said it was actually what she wanted
"December 4, 2019",Dee,5.0,,I love this coffee pot and the feature that allows self service.
"February 29, 2020",nina,5.0,,"This is my third one over the last many years . if and when it wears out, I will get another one"
"September 17, 2017",Ann,5.0,,"This is our 4th BrewStation, we love the product. No carafe is the best idea for coffee dispensing and less work than cleaning a breakable carafe. But do to waste your money on the optional water filter. I wrote a separate review for that!"
"August 4, 2019",John,3.0,,"This is a great coffee dispenser but really disappointed it only lasted 16 months.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 starts."
"May 17, 2020",Leslie Bates,1.0,,This coffee maker leaked from the first cup poured.
"June 2, 2012",Georgia,2.0,,"I've ALWAYS owned a Hamilton Beach Brewstation since they began making them. Never had I ever been disappointed until I purchased this one off of Amazon. It's already broke and had to be thrown away in under a year. When we first received it and used it, it made a loud humming sound when on. I figured it was supposed to be like that for some reason but now I'm thiinking something was wrong right from the start. The box was in perfect condition so I can blame it on shipping. I was so disappointed! We love Amazon and our Brewstation but unfortunately lessoned learned, I will never buy another one from Amazon again. Using it daily and cleaning it according to manufacturer instructions Surely it should've lasted longer than it did. My Brewstation prior to this one lasted me 6 years or so and that's use daily as well. Who knows maybe I just got a dud. All I know is I was extremely DISAPPOINTED!"
"May 6, 2021",Ellen Went,4.0,,This is our second brew station.  They are terrific!  Only drawback for us is the power cord is too short.  Very easy to clean and brew.
"June 13, 2019",Leslie Riley,5.0,,Great coffee pot
"August 29, 2019",Deb,1.0,,The dispenser button frequently sticks preventing you from getting coffee out. The spring behind the dispenser has to be reset. Terrible design!
"April 22, 2019",Cassandra,2.0,,I like this product however it does not brew the entire amount of water you fill in the container. Not sure if I just received a defect or if this is common. Otherwise I have no complaints. It still brews my coffee and exactly the way I like it!
"May 20, 2019",Grandma Coffee,5.0,,Purchased my Coffee maker approximately 6 months ago.....It is by far the BEST Coffee Maker I have ever owned.  I am a heavy coffee drinker and keeping coffee 'tasting great ' four (4) hours later' is amazing for me.  No problems so far and I would DEFINITELY buy it again.  We normally need to replace our coffee maker about every six (6) months... Absolutely love it.  More than I expected.  No burnt taste after 4 hours.
"August 30, 2017",Gotta Be Wowed,3.0,,Love the concept of the brew station and that I can make iced coffee or tea with this machine.  Two cons:  the light on the front is very bright and early in the morning can be tough on the eyes.  It is also noisy after coffee is brewed.  It sounds like water running and is annoying.
"January 2, 2014",Patti B,5.0,,"My first HB brewstation lasted approx. 10 years, never disappointed.  Although skeptical about the new model (i.e. reviews) I ordered it anyway because for the price, I couldn't find one I liked better.  Love it!  Yes, it's different than the first, but improved.  People who complain about dripping water when you remove the reservoir, oh well, it's condensation!  The coffee is great and we love the BOLD feature, we use less coffee. Very happy I kept the faith!"
"October 28, 2018",Samantha Collins,5.0,,Best anniversary gift from my parents ever their old school
"December 15, 2017",Tom Waller,2.0,,"We liked this coffee maker at the start, but after about a year the coffee comes out as a drip, instead of a stream.  It also leaks dirty coffee water now and is tough to keep clean. Time to buy another coffee pot.  I really thought we would get more than a year out of this coffee make."
"March 10, 2017",ST,4.0,,"I love a coffee dispenser. Great coffee, easy to program, better design than the original Brew Station. Ours has a faint vibration/buzzing while it keeps coffee warm, but not annoying enough to send back."
"July 9, 2020",nativeamerican,1.0,,"I be had this since December, 6 months. Now the fragile assembly that open the stopper to get coffee through. Broke and no way of fixing it. I wouldnt suggest buying this."
"March 9, 2016",Michael S.,3.0,One,"I've been using this coffee maker for three months now, and I don't think I can whole-heartedly recommend it, but it's an acceptable coffee maker. I upgraded to this one from a 4-cup Mr. Coffee.  As for the good things about this one, I love how programmable it is; the controls get pretty granular, which is nice from my previous simple coffee maker.  This one has the option to brew either 4 cups or 12, which is nice because sometimes I make coffee just for myself, but most of the time I brew a full 12 cups to share. Honestly though, despite the additional functionality and smarts of this one, I prefer a traditional style coffee maker.  The reservoir system on this one is an interesting concept, but functionally, it's kind of annoying.  I don't know, maybe I'm just accustomed to the traditional style, but I feel like I take this thing half apart just to make a pot of coffee. Secondly, my 20 oz. coffee thermos does not fit in the area provided for filling, so I have to put it in there at an awkward angle.  I prefer being able to pour from a pot because it's quicker and easier to tell how much you've poured.  Not a huge deal, but a minor annoyance first thing in the morning. Lastly, for at least the first month, every batch of coffee I brewed through this thing tasted kind of chemically / plasticy.  I ran several batches of hot water through it, but it still took about a month for the weird taste to subside.  But honestly, I'm not sure if the weird taste actually went away or I just got used to it... either way, after a month, it hasn't been an issue for me. It seems like I'm complaining about this coffee maker a lot, and I guess I am, but it's a perfectly fine coffee maker -- I just prefer the traditional style.  I'll continue using this one for the time being, but I'll probably give it to a friend eventually and switch back to a traditional coffee pot."
"June 26, 2014",elizabeth brant,1.0,2,"Ten days after the ""return"" date the coffee maker has begun leaking. I had another Brewstation that lasted for years, so I am obviously very disappointed. I didn't love this new model, as it was more difficult to use. The older model was all one piece and you just lifted it out, removed filter and could wash in the sink. This model required you to remove the coffee filter part, dripping extensively, take it to sink, wash. Then you had to remove the coffee tank, dripping the whole way, and take to the sink. Then you had to remove the water tank and take to the sink to fill. Not a big deal, but not as streamlined as the old model. The leaking though, is why I gave it a single star. Products should last more than 30 days!!"
"December 11, 2014",kort,4.0,2,I purchased this to replace the exact same one I had.  It does have the same quirks as the last one - it drips a little after you remove your cup but other than that I like it enough to buy the same one.
"August 26, 2015",gerry graziosi,5.0,One,We bought this after burning through k-cups like crazy. We liked that we could make a larger amount of coffee but still dispense it one cup at a time. Having no carafe to break is also a plus as i have been known to break them. Very easy to clean and operate. The 0-4 hour warming option works well as we get up at different times in the morning. He gets his hot cup of coffee and 2 hours later I still get mine.
"December 21, 2015",Robin,5.0,,"I have had this type of coffee pot in the past. I owned this exact moel for about 8 years. When it took a dump, I decided to jump in the Keurig band wagon. Unfortunately I went through 2 Keurigs in 3 years so I decided to go back to this model becuase it lasted so long in the past."
"June 23, 2019",Wayne Padgette,1.0,,"This product was wonderful the first day.  After that, it was worthless.  To call it fragile is being kind."
"March 28, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,I bought this coffee pot a week ago; it worked great but then it started leaking. Now it won’t brew at all! I no longer have the box to return it and I’m super frustrated.
"August 22, 2017",Jennifer,5.0,,Been working great!  No issues and the timer is amazing for having a few cups ready for that sweet before work time.
"January 5, 2020",Rebecca,5.0,,This is the second one I’ve bought. The last one held up for four years with no issues but unfortunately didn’t survive a drop out of the truck when it went on vacation with us when the plastic cracked. Loved it so much we bought the same one.
"July 25, 2018",Amazon Customer,2.0,,The water leaks from the tank and I feel it’s not worth the price and it dosent keep warm for long. The coffee I make for the first time is not warm enough too. Had to reheat it in the microwave. Returning it.
"July 15, 2018",Charlene J.,5.0,,I just love this pot!! I was hesitant to order because of some reviews. I have had it for over six months and make 3 to 4 pots of coffee daily. I have had NO PROBLEMS with it. It keeps the coffee hot and no leaks.
"June 13, 2018",C.Jo,5.0,,"It is my second purchase, wore the first one out"
"September 8, 2017",RJL,5.0,,Perfect for our family! We drink 2+ cups of coffee each morning so the Keurig machines are too slow and expensive. The Hamilton Beach coffee maker gives us just the strength and amount we need for the day. Coffee is hot and remains so for 4 hours.
"April 5, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Although I've own 2 other makers identical to this one (water reservoir seal failed on both) This new maker is horrible and constantly drips hot coffee into the the drip tray causing it to overflow and run all over the counter.
"May 18, 2021",escott,1.0,,"it leaked.  I threw it away.  And, it's made in Chyna."
"March 17, 2021",JimmyZ,1.0,,"The unit was a cheaper and worse version of the original Brewmaster, which was purchased used and worked.  This unit, NEW, doesnt work at ALL.  2 hours of watching videos and how to's were a solemn waste of time."
"March 12, 2021",Marie Keenan,5.0,,the warmer is the best feature..
"October 11, 2020",Judy Deem,5.0,,System didn't last a year....
"January 1, 2017",Lcraf,4.0,,I have enjoyed using my new coffee maker for the past four months.  It makes good coffee and I like the ability to set it for the next morning.  The only bad thing is you have to take it all apart to put water in it each time.
"August 17, 2019",Sandra H.,1.0,,This coffeemaker was not of good quality and was returned.
"November 15, 2018",Joyce Johnson,2.0,,"I bought this because I was looking for a coffeemaker that had a thermal pot and wouldn't ""cook"" my coffee. I was under the impression the tank that keeps the coffee warm was thermal, but it's not. It's made of plastic and has a little rectangular metal heater in the bottom that keeps the coffee warm by --- COOKING it. It tastes terrible after the first hour or so, and definitely is not still fresh after four hours as advertised.  I am returning and getting one with an actual thermal coffee pot."
"April 21, 2020",Ron,5.0,,We have had a couple of these.  They work really good.
"June 5, 2021",sherri Burton,5.0,,Perfect for our office!
"October 27, 2017",Mary Whitlatch,2.0,,This is the 5th one I have purchased over the years. They keep redesigning it and its worse every time. This one you have to try to pour the water in right next to the warmer burner without getting water on it. Good luck. So disappointed in the new design. Loved it until the last couple of redesigns.
"February 19, 2016",LuvMyKindle,5.0,,"I had one of these awhile back and when it died, my husband got a regular coffee maker with a carafe.  I missed this one and bought this to replace it.  Mine works well, no steaming or sputtering and no spilled coffee while pouring.  Makes great coffee."
"May 18, 2020",donna,1.0,,The button to pour inverted after 3 uses. Unfortunately my husband threw the box away so I cannot ship it back.
"February 9, 2018",James P. Ilecki,5.0,,It is way better than the last one I owned. This product has some good changes
"December 19, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Easy to set up and use. Makes me feel like I'm at a fancy cafe.
"January 7, 2020",Candice L. Siders,5.0,,This is my second Hamilton Beach coffee maker exactly the same kind. I’m very pleased with the improvements since my last purchase. Couldn’t be happier with the product.
"August 10, 2016",Sister-Mom,1.0,,"Once I figured it out...because I missed one important step...It is AMAZING!!!!!  OMG! No mess!!!!!! It pours so smoothly, so AMAZING!! UPDATE, one year and two days after purchase it died. I’m furious and caffeine deprived."
"December 13, 2019",Kindle Customer,5.0,,I like everything about this coffee maker
"February 19, 2021",Kenneth R. Taylor,1.0,,"It leaked soon as you tried to dispense coffee ,Just wasn't a good fit for us"
"February 18, 2020",Shawn Johnson,1.0,,Awful. 30 days and stops making 12 cups. 3 cleanings and still only brews 2 cups at a time
"July 13, 2021",Nancy Boggs,5.0,,"Great for disable person who can't lift pot. Makes great tasting coffee ,Keeps coffee hot ,"
"June 30, 2021",DIYer,5.0,,"Great taste of coffee, especially with the option to determine the strength to your liking."
"May 29, 2017",paul d. petty,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot. I had one for a number of years (??) and it just didn't work quite as it should anymore. So I ordered exactly the same one, and I'm glad I did. I love it!!"
"October 27, 2019",roseleewilson,3.0,,This is my second Hamilton Beach coffee station. Had the 1st for 9 years. Still worked !  Replaced it with the same one. Coffee is excellent nice and hot stays warm for 1 to 4 hours.
"January 11, 2020",frances,5.0,,It’s easy to fill the plastic side container without having to pour it anywhere!! Love this coffeemaker!!
"November 3, 2018",Quad Mom,1.0,,Had it for less then 5 months and it started leaking. Had to keep a cup under the dispenser at all times. Also it’s hard to press the button to get the coffee out without holding onto the machine. A little light would also be helpful to see the button.
"April 16, 2018",Rach,5.0,,"My husband really likes this coffee maker, we have only had it a few weeks. But everyone seems to think its good. So we will see how it holds up."
"April 18, 2019",Daniel Stratton,5.0,,The product work better then expected. Was very please with keep warm and rewarm features.
"January 16, 2020",Seat car baby,5.0,,Muy practico
"October 27, 2015",DMac Detroit,4.0,,"Liked it so much we bought another!  Bought our original several years ago. Liked the idea of no more carafes, etc.  After +1,000 'pots' of coffee, our old one got kinda of gross.  I can only clean it so many times over the years and feel good about it. Original still works, just wanted a new one.  I know these are not gourmet coffee makers, but we voted with our money to stay with this model for daily use."
"May 31, 2018",Sherry Morgan,1.0,,This coffee maker began leaking from underneath a month after I purchased it.  The lid kept coming off and it is so light weight you have to have a wall to push it against to get your coffee.  I was very disappointed as I have had an older model that lasted years.  This one doesn't compare to the older models at all.  Seems cheaply made.
"July 13, 2021",pupymom5,1.0,,This machine arrived with bottom plate lose. Then after 2 months of use would not brew a whole pot 9f coffee and it leaked all over the counter
"August 12, 2016",tklamb64,5.0,One,Works very well. Coffee tastes good from beginning to end. Most coffee pots burn the coffee if left on for too long. This doesn't...of course it shuts off after 4 hours.
"June 15, 2021",cathy miller,3.0,,"It makes good coffee,  keeps it warm, turns itself off and IS SOO MESSY!!! It leaves a mess on the counter every morning"
"August 3, 2019",JD Vickery,4.0,,Works good but it’s all plastic so it’s not quite the same as having a glass carafe
"November 2, 2020",Ms G.,5.0,,Love it always wanted one
"July 25, 2019",Alex Espana,1.0,,Product doesn’t hold together well. Coffee carafe doesn’t sit evenly so coffee machine burner continues to burn and make strange noise. Had to shove a piece of card board in the crack to balance out to stop noise and problem. At first use of coffee maker.
"February 8, 2014",evl,5.0,,"Controls are intuitive and nicely laid out, machine is easy to use and makes good coffee.  The 12-cup capacity is nice. We've been using it daily (sometimes more often) for a month or so and have had no problems or complaints.  We use tall coffee mugs at our house, and they fit the dispensing area just fine (really tall travel mugs need to be tilted slightly to fill)."
"February 23, 2021",Angela Guzman,2.0,,I dont like it when I fill my coffee mug the machine slides.  I need to hold the machine while dispensing my coffee . Awkward.
"May 17, 2019",dbabo,3.0,,Love the concept and I’m on my second one. Wish it brewed hotter. First one leaked.
"February 6, 2020",Big Angie,4.0,,Very easy to set up and use. I like the fact that the water reservoir is on the side of the coffee pot.
"September 23, 2017",Sahian,5.0,,Bought this a year and half ago as a gift for my dad and it is still working real strong. It is our one coffee machine in the house and it works great and we did not buy the protection.
"March 28, 2013",S. Beauchamp,5.0,One,We've had a couple of Hamilton Beach coffee makers and they last a couple of years and then leak.  This one has been redesigned to where it should last longer.  (My husband drinks coffee all day long so our coffee makers get a really good workout.)  So far it's working great -- we've had it about a month.  We definitely recommend this coffee maker.
"July 15, 2016",R M Fleming,4.0,,"This coffee maker has grown on me. Was not excited about it first few times I used it as it seemed to almost boil the coffee, maybe because it was new. After continued use the coffee has become better tasting and the boiling factor has gone away. You do have to take it apart to start a pot, so need some counter space available for the basket and reservoir to stand on while filling and putting in grounds."
"July 17, 2021",Laura Karpinsky,1.0,,Dispenser leaks when dispensing coffee. Very disappointed
"February 21, 2021",david d meadows sr,1.0,,"this coffee pot leaks,always a mess to clean up. I have always had these type of coffee pots which would last 5-6 years and no problems, don't know about this one. Keep this one or send it back or Amazon send me a new one!!!! What do you think??? THANKS."
"December 4, 2020",Matthew Aguirre,2.0,,Leaked out from the push button when coffee was hot but not when the coffee was cold.
"February 27, 2018",mell,2.0,,"This is my 2nd time purchasing this coffee pot, the first time it lasted a little over a year...however, we loved it so much we tried it again...this time it only lasted 3 months...the water leaks down into the cafe...there was a crack on the side which caused the leak both times"
"November 7, 2019",Kindle Customer,5.0,,This is my second one. I had good service from the first one. Makes great cup of coffee.
"September 30, 2019",Jessica,1.0,,We loved our Hamilton Beach coffee maker until it stopped working 2 1/2 years later. It also started to leak water from the bottom for the past six months. We will not purchase Hamilton Beach products in the future.
"July 2, 2021",CbRb1127,3.0,,Only used 3 times and failed to sense water in it.
"March 16, 2016",JSB,5.0,One,"When my much used Hamilton Beach Brew Station began leaking, I tried a Nespresso. I quickly realized more expensive does not mean better. The Nespresso was returned. I replaced my Hamilton Beach with the new model. I could not be happier."
"March 9, 2020",Jacquie Day,5.0,,"This is my 4th one, love it!"
"November 21, 2018",Rollin,5.0,,Arrived quickly and was just what we needed. Great coffee pot
"February 20, 2020",The Girl Next Doerr,4.0,,"This is the third or fourth of this exact coffee maker that I have purchased because it’s simply amazing for the price. This last order was damaged on the holding vessel, a bit dented."
"July 19, 2019",Gareth E. Methvin,5.0,,Product delivered as expected.  Coffee pot works well.  Very satisfied.
"November 14, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Difficult to determine how much coffee is left via right side indicator
"March 25, 2016",Mommy2_1,5.0,,"This is by far hands down the best coffee pot I have ever purchased. Easy to use, coffee tastes great, and alter to liking easily or make it stronger by pushing bold. It has a timer which is fantastic for early morning prior to work. And no more spills on the counter as this is a dispenser. :) Love it!"
"March 4, 2018",David W Johnson,1.0,,I absolutely loved this coffee maker when I started using it.  It was wonderful to have the coffee hot for a few hours and still taste fresh!  But suddenly it stopped working.  This was only after 2 months of use.  And I only made coffee a couple of times a week.
"December 26, 2019",Brittanee Chicas,5.0,,I love that it doesn’t have a glass coffee pot and it is all internal. I love filling my cup up directly from the machine (no mess). Overall cleaning is easy I do recommend flushing it out weekly (just run water) after fully cleaning it.
"January 10, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,Button a little hard to push causing the unit to slide backwards when refilling a cup.
"March 20, 2016",Izza,5.0,,"Best one we have owned. I had a few different brew stations over the year's, this model is the best. It is easy to program, easy to fill,  keeps the coffee hot, and is also easy to clean. Only had it for 1 month. Hope it continues to be my favorite."
"June 5, 2021",Marygalek,5.0,,I love this coffee maker!! No decanter to break. - just press the silver bar with your cup & presto the coffee comes into your cup. Great for seniors & the coffee stays Hot for 1 - 4 hours!!!!
"October 4, 2014",Richard,4.0,,"It's our third Hamilton Beach and it is better than the others except for two things.  First, the coffee is not as hot as it could be.  Second, when it is dark in the morning the blue light on the front of the coffee maker is so bright, you can't see the coffee filling your cup. After over filling my cup a few times, I now only take half a cup at a time.  But, overall we like it."
"April 24, 2018",Paola Youkhanna,4.0,,i really like this coffee maker the only thing is the numbers fade away to fast
"June 16, 2021",Sharon O.,4.0,,"This is just what I was looking for...it keeps the coffee hot for up to four hours, I can program it to the time I want my morning coffee and it’s ready and waiting for me, I can use any size cup, mug or travel container."
"June 28, 2021",Gloria,4.0,,"This is the third Hamilton Beach Beverage Server I've bought, so needless to say, I really like it.  This one, however, is leaking at the serving spout.....rather annoying.  I would give it five stars except for that....."
"October 25, 2018",KJ,2.0,,"Instructions need to be rewritten to say ONLY put in 1 tbsp of coffee grounds per cup of coffee. I figured this part was optional, I enjoy stronger coffee so I am used to using more grounds. Apparently if you dont do this, the coffee will leak out of the dispenser and all over your countertops like I experienced this morning. Only in the “troubleshooting” section of the instructions does it go into detail about why it may be leaking, which is too little, too late."
"March 9, 2020",D4Hawg,3.0,,I live the way it dispenses the coffee without the need for a coffee pot. My biggest complaint  is it does not keep the coffee hot. It is warm but not hot.
"July 5, 2021",Joan A Murphy,1.0,,Very disappointing very flimsy. Not like my other Hamilton beac cofffee maker.
"February 20, 2020",barbara lee,5.0,,Like it very much.
"June 17, 2021",donald klein,5.0,,"Like EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!  KEEPS COFFEE HOT,NO GLASS CARAFES TO BREAK!  CONVENIENT IN EVERY WAY!  HAVE PURCHASED SIX (6) OVER THE YEARS. TWO PERSONAL AND FOUR AS GIFTS!"
"June 4, 2018",Barb Tee,5.0,,"This is our second HB 12-cup coffee maker. We wore out the first one.  We like the convenience that this unit offers.  It is also the perfect size for two coffee drinkers, though we do sometimes ""share"" it's contents."
"July 16, 2020",Jackie,1.0,,Horrible coffee maker!! Leaks and is a messy system
"January 6, 2020",Kindle Customer,1.0,,Broken when received. Returned. Purchased to replace same coffee maker that has started to leak entire lot of coffee
"March 28, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Good
"July 9, 2019",Rachel Taylor,4.0,,Delivered today and haven’t brewed yet. A few comments based off the product itself. Very flimsy and cheap. Love the concept of it and programming it was a breeze. I’ll update on the flavor/ cleaning in a few days.
"February 27, 2021",Jaren,3.0,,"Had one for about a year until it started leaking coffee out the bottom. Screws are all tight, I think the o-rings failed. Despite this, I bought another one because when it works, i like it."
"December 20, 2013",rj124104,5.0,,Not having a carafe is a convenience you may not realize until you don't have one.  I purchased the original version of this and now the second version. The improvement to the removable water tank are great. Keeps your coffee toasty and no need to worry about older folk burning or spilling coffee with the carafe. That's the main reason I bought this.  It's super easy to use and safe.
"February 5, 2018",Donna,5.0,,"Works great. as a timer so it turns itself on and off too. No carafe, no mess. Very good, basic, quality coffee pot."
"February 18, 2020",Michael J Baker,1.0,,Bought this to replace one I had for six years that also leaked. I guess I am a slow learner. Less than two weeks and the new one leaks too. Never again. Don’t waste your money.
"July 10, 2014",Carol A. Decker,1.0,One,"This is our 2nd Brewstation and we have had the same problem with both.  When cleaning, there is no grip on the filter and it has to be popped out with a butter knife.  Then the seal comes out and won't reseal, rendering the pot useless because it won't stop leaking.  There are no instructions in the manual for how to get the seal back in properly."
"May 31, 2021",Heather,5.0,,Easy to clean. Keeps coffee hot as long as you set timer. Easy to make as iced coffee.
"April 24, 2019",Connie,5.0,,I love this coffeemaker!
"May 29, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,This coffee is so easy to use!  I actually leave the brewed coffee in tank all day so that I can have an ice coffee in the afternoon.  And best part the coffee grinds in coffee.  I would highly suggest this coffee maker.
"July 24, 2016",Sharla,2.0,2,I would not recommend this coffee maker. Condensation collects under basket and has to be emptied daily. Have had it less than a year and all the water does not dispense out of the reservoir. Have cleaned it regularly via instructions.
"November 2, 2014",Orland Fan,5.0,,"I love this coffeemaker!  It doesn't require a carafe (to break).  The water reservoir comes out -- and to the sink.  Both components can be immersed in water for easy cleaning.  The only regret I have is that I recently saw a Hamilton Beach with the same great features, but it was also able to use single-use Keurig coffee containers."
"November 20, 2013",Kindle kkp,4.0,,"We've used these pots for a number of years.  I love not having a glass carafe.  Recently, I ordered a new one (ordered a 10 cup in error).  Too small for us and leaked every time a cup was decanted.  Reordered a 12-cup and it too leaks like crazy when coffee is decanted.  Seems it must be a design flaw.  I'll use it until it expires, but will consider something else for my next purchase."
"March 27, 2016",Kindle Customer,4.0,,"Got this coffee maker for our new house. It works really well! It is some what of a hassle to fill the chamber with water- you have to take out the basket, then take out the coffee warmer chamber, then fill up the water chamber! But other than that it is a great coffee maker that keeps your coffee warm and takes out the hassle of having to clean a coffee pot!"
"April 14, 2021",Nathan M,1.0,,"Brand new, ran water through it first before adding coffee. Then programmed it to start brewing at 5:00 am, filled water resivor  up to 10 cups. Only got one cup of coffee, no water or coffee on counter, this happened two days in a row"
"August 26, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Loves this coffee pot and wouldn't ever go back to a different kind of coffee pot.
"January 11, 2013",Amazon Customer,5.0,3,"I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my daughter.  After a few tries we finally got the hang of how to make our coffee.  We both agree:  The coffee is great, so good.... the brewstation is easy to clean, easy to serve the and very easy to figure out how to program it. Getting up at 6:00a.m. and smelling my coffee is a delight.  We also love the fact that it has directions on how to make iced coffee! I've read comments about how it slides on the counter when serving, my solution was to put a paper towel or a nice dish cloth under it to protect my counter from spills and the great side effect is the pot does'nt move, so no problems so far.  To us it is worth it. Maria Grace and Corinne"
"April 20, 2020",vw lover,5.0,,"I loved my first one so much, I replaced it with this new one.  I had the old one for years!  Great tasting coffee to the end!"
"August 1, 2019",Patricia Stidam,5.0,,This is the third coffee maker.  One is in our RV an the new on in our home.  We love the ease of making coffee and you can adjust the flavor depending on how much coffee used.
"August 31, 2019",Melvyn A. Sacks,5.0,,"Easy to use, and makes good coffee."
"November 24, 2017",F. Kimper,5.0,,I have never had a coffee maker without a carafe.  This one makes the coffee very quickly.  Easy to clean and fill.  Like that there is no carafe to break.  I hope the dispenser seal lasts as there seems no way to replace it.
"September 28, 2018",LARRY C.,3.0,,"Handy, but leaks the water out . Small amounts"
"March 1, 2021",Patricia Diamond,2.0,,"If you push the button to dispense too far in, it leaks.  Have to push only until coffee starts to flow."
"December 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Seems to work alright. My husband makes and drinks the coffee so can’t tell you how flavor is.
"April 14, 2021",Peachpova,1.0,,Coffee should not be around this heating element. There’s a leak somewhere. Will be returning.
"November 4, 2019",Jacqueline A. Lipson,5.0,,I’m very happy with the product.
"October 27, 2015",Buzz,4.0,,"This is the 3rd one we have purchased.  We love the convenience of not having a carafe.  However it seems they all develop internal leaks that create puddles of water inside that eventually leak out onto the counter.  Wish they could find a way to stop this. However, we deal with it because we love the way it brews our coffee."
"January 15, 2020",Sharron Spielmann,4.0,,The button you press to dispense the coffee isn’t flat so if your cup isn’t pressing evenly on the button your cup slips off and the coffee spills out of your cup
"February 24, 2020",Jerrie Romero,5.0,,Don’t have to pick up a glass pot and have it fall and break
"January 28, 2020",rerunn3,5.0,,Love it!
"April 21, 2017",Diana,2.0,,"It was working fine for couple months, but then coffee started leaking between coffee pot and warmer section. I asked couple of my friends who bought it after seeing it in my place and they started having same issues. Good coffee machine, but poor execution"
"April 17, 2021",mommahartman,1.0,,I haven’t had this coffeemaker 2 months yet and the wording is coming off the front. It also does not use all the water in the reservoir leaving you short on coffee.
"May 9, 2018",Gregory W.,1.0,,"We set it to brew and some coffee piddled out onto the counter before anyone pressed the release button. Strangely enough, when I tried to get it to fill my coffee mug, no coffee came out. At all. The first and last attempt at using this. Nobody messes with my morning coffee. It is currently being returned for a refund. Don’t get this."
"August 12, 2017",Tarah Rodriguez,4.0,,I thought this was a Great buy at first.  The coffee maker worked great but died on me within 2 years.. I guess that’s what you can expect for the price.
"July 25, 2019",Douglas D Morgan,5.0,,I have had three of these over the years and all have been very good.  I like this new model as it is easier to use and works very well.
"November 1, 2020",J Hollis,3.0,,Bought this because it said it would make up to twelve cups of coffee but in reality it its more like six good cups. To clean this coffee pot it is a little hard to clean. Good product but a lot of maintenance.
"November 20, 2019",Dorothy K Grady,5.0,,"Love the idea no carafe to deal with, easy tp use and clean. Coffee taste great."
"March 27, 2018",Matthew Brannon,3.0,,"Not crazy about the push mechanism for pouring, seems to always spill a bit. It's also kind of annoying how you need to disassemble several pieces every time you make coffee. But the brewing itself is pretty good."
"January 17, 2017",ellen,5.0,One,My husband has hated the Kuerig since I bought it about 3 years ago. I bought this as a Christmas present and he was so excited. It works great and no more make a cup/drink a cup. He can make multiple cups and dispense as he wants them.
"January 25, 2019",Eric Pabon,5.0,,"This coffee maker is awesome. We use it  a couple of times a day, everyday and it makes a decent cup. At its price, it’s a good deal."
"February 26, 2014",D. Eason,5.0,,"After reading all the reviews, pro and con, I decided to give it a try. It makes great coffee, is really easy to use, and easy to clean. The only drawback I saw was using the pour spout piece to fill the water reservoir. It made a mess. The problem was easily solved by simply filling the reservoir using a tea kettle, instead. I'd buy it again."
"September 10, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,Great coffee maker.  I like not having a warmer that a glass pot sits on.  Other pots we have had in the past eventually begin to rust at the warmer plate.  This pot works great and looks great.  Coffee is hot and brews very nicely.
"February 17, 2021",Barry Fox,2.0,,Coffee leaks through the dispenser lever and down the front of the machine with every cup. I keep paper towels under the machine for easy clean up.
"December 20, 2020",jeri,1.0,,"Bought this product in April 2020, now dec 2020 coffee leaks from the dispenser when pouring.  Coffee gets all over my counter. The instructions suggest to clean the coffee maker if that happens.  I followed the instructions and coffee still leaks"
"February 9, 2018",Tammy W.,5.0,,Best coffee pot ever  set boldness and a timer never had an issues with it
"September 28, 2018",marybeth,4.0,,"Works well, design nice, dispenser high enough to fit travel mug.  Lid seems cheaply made, no light on dispenser so hard to see  when cup is full.  Very loud when brewing.  Over all, makes a good cup of coffee."
"September 20, 2019",Somebody's Dad,5.0,,HB makes two models of tank coffee makers. This one is more expensive but well worth the extra bucks.
"December 22, 2018",CrystalC,5.0,,"I love this coffeemaker! I love that I can set it at night and my coffee is ready and waiting for me when I wake up. And even if I oversleep, the inner reservoir keeps it hot and fresh for me. No carafe to wash (or break) and I can fill any size mug quickly and easily. Very happy with this purchase!"
"March 2, 2015",EtTuD2,5.0,One,"We are really enjoying this coffeemaker. It works great, simple to set up and program, keeps coffee hot, PLUS - with a reusable gold filter insert, it's low eco-impact. Eschewed the K-cup craze for waste and expense; replaced our last carafe-based coffeemaker with this carafe-less system. We're very happy with this coffeemaker."
"October 23, 2019",EW,5.0,,"Easy to use, easy to program."
"October 30, 2016",Wild thing,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. This is my third one over a 10 year period. Coffee always tastes wonderful and perfectly hot. And don't forget to clean it once a month. That really makes a difference.
"May 8, 2019",KAREN E. WIGGINS,1.0,,I purchased this coffee maker in February for a new apartment.  I just unpacked it and filled it with water and the water just started spewing out of the bottom.  And it  is now only 8 May 19.  I believe that I was sent a lemon.  And the Customer Service @ Hamilton Beach is less that Professional.
"November 3, 2015",Jean,1.0,3,"I am not happy with the design of this coffee pot at all. It is very messy for adding the water. I have had a Hamilton Beach coffee maker before and was very satisfied, this one however was not designed well. I have yet to fill the water into the pot without dripping water all over."
"August 26, 2019",MARK A.,5.0,,Good product
"November 21, 2016",Corby,5.0,One,"I love this, keeps coffee hot for 4 hours. You can make 1 cup up to 12 cups. I can have coffee all day. Makes tea too. The filter comes out and the well comes out for easy cleaning. You can brew now or later. I am not disappointed."
"April 20, 2021",Judy Meester,3.0,,"I was not a fan of how the coffee seemed to continue to heat in the holder.  It appeared to still be cooking, and not just staying hot.  Won't buy another one."
"July 7, 2015",Crazy for Kindle,3.0,,"The coffee was good but the condensation that puddled around the warming plate was a hassle. Every time I made coffee, I had to sop up the water around the warming plate. I don't know if that made it a danger or not. I liked that you could keep your coffee warm for up to 4 hours but it did not keep the taste of the coffee fresh."
"June 8, 2021",sierra,5.0,,I love it wore  our my first one  best coffee  maker ever
"December 11, 2015",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I seriously love this thing. I much prefer being able to just use ""standard"" coffee supplies rather than kcups and such. The ability to make myself enough coffee for a cup during breakfast, then enough left to fill my thermos for work, is awesome! Love it. To those who have concerns about the ""leaking"" issue. I have yet to experience anything like this, and looking at the design, if it were ever to occur. It would be easily remedied by simply cleaning the ""spout"". Would definitely recommend this for the price, cant beat it! Wouldnt trade it for a $200 kurig."
"January 17, 2014",Johan,5.0,,"My roommate in college had one of these and I always liked it, so now that I'm all growed up I bought one for my office. I like the fact that there's no fragile glass carafe and I feel that the coffee tastes much fresher, even after sitting in the machine for a few hours. I like that it keeps the coffee warm for 4 hours instead of the standard 2. Overall I highly recommend it."
"January 11, 2020",DARomero,5.0,,Great coffee pot!  Son loves it
"January 9, 2013",S. Selsavage,5.0,,"The product worked fine and pours fine and does NOT spill and I noticed: the poor reviews seem to have been written a few years ago. Maybe problem solved. One caveat: my product came w/o the metal piece that is inserted directly below the spout, on the bottom, pictured here in the Amazon photo. I simply called Hamilton Beach, sent them an email with the Amazon receipt, and they will forward me the piece."
"June 18, 2017",Shelton_50,5.0,,"My fav. Coffee maker, hands down. For a drip coffee maker, in my opinion you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. If you leave your coffee on for a few hours its not going to be disgusting & burned because its not on direct heat. Its a miracle!"
"November 22, 2019",Sam,5.0,,Absolutely love this coffee maker! Brews iced coffee everything about it is awesome!
"August 8, 2020",Lonnie C Talbert,3.0,,Leaks from reservoir.
"July 12, 2018",Mgilles44,5.0,,"Replaced the Ninja coffee maker as I was tired of cleaning the coffee stains in the carafe.  I was also tired of not having a cup of HOT coffee.  Well, I am very happy with my new coffee maker...no more stains to clean and I now get HOT coffee in the morning and throughout the morning!!!  A must buy!!!!"
"August 20, 2020",Linda Wright,4.0,,Leaks on bottom
"February 11, 2013",Len B,5.0,One,"We were tired of broken carafes in the sink or dishwasher, and I was not impressed with the reviews of the unbreakable ones.  The Brewstation seemed like the solution we were looking for.  What can I say, it works as advertised.  There is NO problem getting the coffee into  the cup or thick mug.  (Honestly, I don't see why anyone would say that they had an issue with that) I especially like the option of 1 to 4 hours of coffee warming time.  I haven't tried the iced coffee trick, but it is an interesting idea.  It is easy to load, easy to clean and it makes great coffee.  What's not to like?"
"January 21, 2013",Elizabeth Elliott,5.0,,"I bought this unit to replace my previous brewstation. The upgrades from the first one i have are incredible. I love the removable resevoir, the brew strength options, and the option to have the coffee stay warm up to 4 hours! My first brewstation was purchased over 6 years ago .. it was dificult to get tall latte cups under it .. i dont have those worries any more !"
"July 16, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,Had to send back it leaked
"January 23, 2021",Tom Schroller,1.0,,"Missing the rubber feet on the bottom, it slides across counter when getting a cup of coffee. Drip tray doesn't stay attached.  Contacted the manufacturer who basically doesn't care. Won't buy Hamilton Beach again."
"February 11, 2018",JM888,5.0,,I love this machine. I make coffee everyday and love that you can even get coffee before its completely done. Keeps the coffee hot for as long as you want it. No carafes breaking.
"February 15, 2020",Sha,1.0,,Leaks.  Even when not overfilled.  Don’t waste your money
"April 27, 2014",Lee A. Bard,5.0,,"The coffee pot works great and does a great job keeping it warm. This is the second one we have bought. The  last one was equally good but started to leak from the bottom. This one is great and does not look like it will leak from the bottom. The coffee hold is up higher and is has a bigger pot size, I would buy it again."
"October 26, 2020",paul randolph jr,5.0,,Awesome coffee maker
"November 24, 2017",SoCADesertRat,5.0,,"After 4.5 years of use still going strong without any adverse issues.  Love the coffee, so much better than having a glass carafe sitting on a burner that scorches the flavor.  Highly recommend"
"June 20, 2014",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"I have used Hamilton Beach BrewStation coffeemakers for years.  This one has a side container that you take to the sink, fill with water and set back on the machine.  No dismantling the machine to fill it.  The one I had before this one was a real pain to make coffee.  No pots to mess with just press your cup against the bar and you get coffee."
"November 1, 2020",Amber Carmody,1.0,,"The coffee pot leaked from the back tank not even owning  bought it 6 months. Leaked coffee all over my tile counter,staining my grout. I'm my cabinet drawers,down into the floor. Disappointed however I am usually satisfied with Hamilton Beach."
"April 8, 2021",Kris H.,1.0,,Appeared to be a returned item. Coffee didn't stay warm and when it got down to a small amount of coffee it smelled like it was burning. Returned the item and went back to using my old Hamilton Beach Brew Station.
"November 12, 2019",A User,1.0,,Don’t waste your money for some cosmetic coffee maker. Get you a $20 one so you won’t have to wait 5 min for a cup of coffee to be poured into your mug.
"January 8, 2020",ishkooowe 184,5.0,,Still using
"May 12, 2021",Anita Touchton,5.0,,I especially blove that this coffee maker keeps my coffee hot for such a long time.  I sip on my coffee throughout the morning since I work from home and I love that every time I top it off the coffee is hot like the first cup. Great product!!
"March 6, 2020",Nancy Tackett,5.0,,I cant figure out how to program the timer to start on its own
"November 4, 2020",Karen B.,5.0,,"We like not having a carafe.  This is the 3rd one we've ordered. We have one in our camper, and one in our house. The one in the house needed to be replaced after 3 years. We love it!"
"November 9, 2019",Brenda Mims,5.0,,I absolutely love my new coffee maker! This is my 2nd one to own! You don’t get the aroma of coffee brewing from a 1 cup coffee maker.
"November 16, 2020",Barbara Watkins,5.0,,We ABSOLUTELY love the new coffee maker. The flavor is full & delicious!
"October 4, 2018",Ainjylface,5.0,,This is our third one of these. They last about a year brewing every day. After a while the dispenser begins to seep and eventually leaks. Then it’s time for another one. Much easier than dealing with the glass pots.
"February 9, 2018",Tammy W.,5.0,,Absolutely love this coffee pot I bought another to save for a back up
"February 20, 2017",Ron Nelson,4.0,One,Like it but you need to remove grounds if you want it to stay hot for extended time. You can hear the warming plate sizzling to keep it hot and there is so much steam it keeps dripping up and back down through the grounds.
"April 8, 2016",Amnity,4.0,,Great coffee maker and love the design of it being a dispenser. That being said.....Why is there no suction cups on the front and rubber stoppers on the back to stop it from sliding????? Mind blown.
"May 2, 2021",Janice Baucom,3.0,,Do not buy this. HamiltonBeach Brew station. My first one would not make hot coffee. The second one leaked all over my granite  counter Tops the rug the appliances. I am done buying this defective. Coffee pot
"April 25, 2017",RinkyDink,3.0,2,"Very convenient to use. The water reservoir is easy to remove, fill and replace. The coffee brews quickly. You can set the length of time you want the coffee to be kept warm. The down side is that it makes a noise the whole time it is on.....almost like it is still trying to make more coffee. When dispensing coffee, the pot is light and will move if you don't hold on to the pot. But, the price was right and it looks great with my other chrome appliances!"
"July 4, 2018",BAF,5.0,,Easy to operate. Brews great coffee. Would purchase again.
"June 2, 2021",zeeeman64,5.0,,I love this coffee maker for the fact there is not a glass carafe that can break and the push button dispensing in the coffee cup.
"June 16, 2014",Babins Shrestha,1.0,One,"I bought this one for our lab. From the reviews I thought this is all programmable and hi-fi stuff but to make coffee in this is way more tedious than to make in traditional ones. Programmable means you can only make the coffee hot for 4 hours. If coffee is there and you want to heat it, there is no option. Also you need to take out two stuffs before you fill up the coffee compartment. Overall, it looks sleeker than our previous coffee maker but all my friends are complaining when they make coffee or when they go and fill up cold coffee."
"September 6, 2017",Mich,4.0,,"Love this ""brew station"" except for the front drip section which fall off and disconnects easily.  Makes great coffee, hope they bring back the other models though."
"November 25, 2018",MomofOne,2.0,,"I was really disappointed in this coffee maker.  I read the reviews and kept waiting until it was fully done brewing, but still the coffee came out lukewarm at best :/  I am returning it and will get the traditional type of coffee pot."
"May 30, 2019",K Bennett,2.0,,"Liked it but coffee took way to long to get hot after brewing.  Do not use it anymore, very frustrating."
"December 11, 2017",george,5.0,,"Really great with no carafe. my wife is a coffee snob and loves it easy to use , fill and clean...awesome"
"February 5, 2021",David Popham,5.0,,Stays hot longer than Mr. Coffee.
"September 9, 2018",tessc10,1.0,,Not even two months old and it leaking somewhere not sure from where but under the coffee make it drips onto the counter very dissappointed
"September 22, 2014",Virago,5.0,One,I love this coffee maker.  I love that all of the water compartments are separate and removable.  I had an older version where the water went inside the machine and it was next to impossible to clean it.  The two separate compartments make cleaning and caring for the machine so much easier.  And it brews a great cup of coffee.
"May 12, 2013",Frank,4.0,,This is a nice solution to the home that wants to get away from a carafe but also can't stand using Keurig cups.  A carafe has always been acceptable but a bit cumbersome.  Keurig cups leak sometimes and eventually the cost of them becomes ridiculous.  This inexpensive brewer works well had has most of the features for someone that just simply wants a good cup of coffee in a large mug!
"April 9, 2019",Ashley Betterly,5.0,,Easy to clean and use. I love being able to brew iced coffee or hot coffee with the same brewer.
"December 26, 2020",Suzanne Eynon,1.0,,At leaks when you go to push your cup into the dispenser runs down behind it
"March 14, 2018",William S. Rees,1.0,,Died 2 months out of warranty.  Slow to brew coffee. Can be difficult to fill with water.
"July 15, 2021",Sarah Timmons,1.0,,I bought the coffee maker in April and in July it started leaking water from the bottom of the machine! We had the same brand years ago and it lasted for a very long time but I would not buy this brand again!!!
"June 28, 2021",Sheral Foster,2.0,,I purchased this one and it leaked very badly when you get your coffee.  So returned and got another and it was worse.  I think there is a design flaw with this model.
"February 12, 2017",Kindle Customer,3.0,,"We had this brewstation for about 2 years and while it make coffee wonderfully, and kept it hot, over the last 4 months the coffee would come out into the cup as a trickle. It took a frustrating amount of time to fill the cup. I soaked it in vinegar, hoping to help the issue, but it did not make a difference. In desperation, I disassembled the serving ""spout"" to clean it, which did help increase the flow of coffee, however now we have a constant drip and have to keep paper towels over the drip tray to absorb the mess."
"January 24, 2021",Rebecca Caton,1.0,,Leaks all over the counter when filling a coffee mug.
"January 28, 2016",Brent S.,1.0,One,"Awkward to use,  especially in a communal setting.  Kind of unsanitary have a bunch of people put their mug to the button. Slides across the counter when trying to dispense. Hard to see  how full tall cups are while filling.  Doesn't work well with tall cups. Coffee level window hard to see how full it is. Good thing it died after a year."
"September 30, 2019",Cami,5.0,,It’s so easy to use and saves me tons of money making my ice coffee at home!
"February 24, 2020",Cb,1.0,,"When depressing button for coffee, the whole left side of the pot was too light weight and would move backwards. This was very aggravating! I returned the pot."
"July 6, 2021",Erica,5.0,,I love this machine. I have it set next to the keurig for the flexibility. So easy to preset so I can zombie my way thru the morning ritual!
"July 25, 2017",Varghese Samuel,5.0,,Works great. Have for a couple of months now. My 3rd in 12 years. Love everything this type of coffee maker.
"May 30, 2020",teresa adkins,1.0,,"Leaked the first time I made coffee. After I cleaned it up, it leaked more. Also the coffee doesn’t stay very hot. This is my third one of these machines and they don’t last very long. I liked them because there was no carafe but I will not purchase another one."
"January 11, 2020",bretsfp,5.0,,"No more forgetting to put the carafe back, so no more coffee on the counter"
"June 28, 2016",Ray,3.0,3,"The coffee was not hot, so I had to measure it.  My meat thermometer read 170 deg F.  The controls are nice, the keep warm/auto shut-off timer is good, no caraf reqired is good. My wife likes the temperature, so we will keep it, but I cann't recommend it.  I'll use the microwave, or just take a 1/2 cup at a time."
"May 11, 2021",Marc P.,4.0,,This replaced a cuisinart which was triple the price. It makes good coffee but a little less Easy to clean A little noisy when brewing. Controls are clear and straightforward. Great machine for the price if it holds up
"January 30, 2021",Shellye Ayers,2.0,,The only thing wrong with this product is it leaks every time you dispense into the cup.  It makes a horrible mess every time and has done this since the second use.  I bought it for use in our camper and am very disappointed in the mess it makes.
"December 18, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Gifted
"May 10, 2020",KT of MO,3.0,,"Although I love ease, convenience and the flavor of freshly brewed coffee of my HB Brew Station, I do not like that it has developed a leak from the bottom of the heat element.  So use caution."
"February 26, 2020",Nichole Martinez,5.0,,Bought as a gift and they loved it!!!! Used daily since Christmas and it works wonderfully.
"October 14, 2014",Dan P,1.0,,"I Guess You Get What You Pay For When our Cuisinart single serve (which was great) gave up the ghost, I went looking for a replacement and found this - similar but significantly cheaper.  I should have known better.  The coffeemaker worked OK for a few months, but lately has taken to discharging any unused coffee onto the surface it sits on.  So, when I go to empty it there is a huge mess to clean up.  Not cool.  I wouldn't recommend this machine."
"December 28, 2018",millie glenn,2.0,,Water reservoir started to leak (water all over the counter) after about six months of use.  Cannot seat the reservoir on the pot until ready to brew.
"August 23, 2019",Becky,1.0,,"I have had for just over 30 days. It started to make only 4 cups instead of 12.  1-4 cups is NOT selected. Not lit up.  I have unplugged, cleaned and re-entered all settings. Will not make more than 4 cups. Very unhappy with this product."
"November 28, 2020",Kakha,5.0,,Great product!
"December 30, 2014",Tommy D.,1.0,2,"I purchased this item(Hamilton Beach 47950 12-cup Brewstation Dispensing Drip Coffeemaker) from Amazon during Sept. 2014. A few weeks after using this item, I noticed the well beneath the carafe had filled with water and began leaking on my counter top and potentially seeping into the hot plate. I exchanged this defective unit with another and received it Dec. 26th 2014. After one week of average use, I noticed the well began to fill with water once again. I concluded this was due to condensation developing beneath the upper cover to a point at which a small but steady flow of water drained into the well. This is a highly flawed design and could pose a potential fire hazard. Electricity and water can make for a world of hurt. I am sending this review directly to Hamilton Beach and the US Product Safety Commission as well. My advice to all consumers with this unit is to lift the carafe and inspect the well surrounding the hot plate. If you see an accumulation of water, please refrain from using."
"April 6, 2021",Bryce Atchison,1.0,,I purchased this for my grandma for her birthday. When pouring the coffee it leaks down the back of the dispensing area and makes a mess. I returned the coffee machine for another but had the same issue. Very disappointed.
"July 2, 2016",J. Thomsen,5.0,,I first used this coffee maker at work.  I liked the design so much I decided to get one for home. I like that the coffee doesn't have a burnt taste if it sits for awhile to keep warm. Clean up is easy.  It's also able to be programmed so you can wake up to coffee.
"May 20, 2021",victor flanders,5.0,,It was exactly what I was looking for again seems like the other retail places don't carry this item anymore .you can't go wrong with this item you can program it to start when you want it to.
"March 28, 2021",April Kaech,3.0,,"The coffee pot dribbles down the front while filling cups.  Leaves a mess on the counter every morning.  Other than that it works great.  Love the design, just wish it didn't make such a mess."
"September 8, 2014",Lori B,5.0,,I love it! So easy to use & easy to clean. My husband & I had a Mr. Coffee 8-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker & after I pitched that one for more reasons that I feel like typing...this Brewstation was what we should have originally purchased. It's awesome! I had a few of my friends over for a dinner party & they were all impressed with this coffee maker.
"November 6, 2013",The House That Shamrock Built,5.0,,"wonderful coffee maker makes great coffee every time had mines for two years and it's still is great "" only thing is you have to keep the drip tray clean and check for occasionally insects "" I have know idea why they are attracted to the electrical outlet when it is plugged in but other than that it's a great coffee maker easy , if your that person on the go "".."
"April 13, 2014",G. L. Clark,1.0,One,"this is my 3 rd. Hamilton Beach brew station coffee maker . I loved the first 2 and just plain wore them out . Both lasted for years. this one sucks .. and I'm totally discourage with the workmanship, quality and performance of it . It leaks water all over the counter. doesn't always disperse all the water, in the tank . the drip catcher doesn't stay put, when mopping up the water from my counter, the drip catcher, usually ends up on the floor .  The lid to the part that holds the coffee grounds, is always coming off the hinges . soooooooo disappointed in the one Hamilton Beach !! Sincerely, G. L. Clark"
"February 3, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Received timely but leaks down dispensing area and on the counter. Gave it a second chance thinking just cracked, in shipping maybe But no received its replacement and it leaked also. Needs corrected"
"December 24, 2015",E. H.,4.0,,"The cord is crazy short on this coffee pot, so I had to use an extension cord to even reach the plug. Otherwise, this pot is wonderful! I love the level to dispense coffee. No carafe to clean and the coffee stays hot for a predetermined amount of time. The coffee pot is easy to fill each  day. Great purchase!"
"March 24, 2016",A. Theresa Duncan,4.0,,I like most of the features of this coffee maker. The removable carafe can spill sometimes while pouring it in to the base if you are not careful. I like the rewarm setting and not having that burnt coffee taste.
"April 1, 2014",Pamela S Jordan-Wood,5.0,,"Previously had a Cuisinart coffee and hot water unit, which we had replaced 3 separate times due to failure.  This Hamilton Beach is perfect.  Would like it if a travel mug would fit better (according to my husband), but it's great.  Works every time.  The last cup is not bitter at all.  It's still pretty new, but I'm hopeful it will last a long time.  And NO MESS!"
"March 26, 2013",MomofJ,5.0,2,We had an older version of the hamilton beach brewstation and loved it until it started leaking all over our counter. This updated version is 100 times better than the original! I love that you pour the water in the bottom instead of trying to get it in a small space in the top. I also love that I can brew iced coffee in it! I would highly suggest this coffee pot to anyone!
"April 8, 2021",Diana Beck,5.0,,"Love the ""brew station "". Keeps my  coffee hot for the full 4 hours. I like my coffee strong,  just having "" colored water "" is not for me. The  ""bold "" selection is great at making strong coffee perfectly!"
"October 5, 2014",eagle,5.0,,"After my old coffee maker broke I tried a fancy one that cost over $125 and it gowned the bean for you.. Had nothing but trouble with it , so I went back to the Hamilton Beach Brew station and it is just wonderful  for me. This coffee maker was a lot less and very happy with this one ,coffee in 10 minutes , display is easy to read, cleans up just fine."

"April 2, 2014",D. Aher,2.0,One,"I read the reviews before I bought this coffeemaker but since I had an older model of this coffeepot and liked it I bought it anyway.  Mistake!  Most of the reviews were correct plus I can add a couple cons.  The heater runs all the time giving the later cups a burnt taste.  My cups have a rounded lip and they slip off the bar that needs to be pushed to get the coffee.  I have granite countertops and the whole pot slides when I push on the bar,  Pro - it looks nice!"
"October 7, 2018",wilburbudsmom,3.0,One,Sloppy to fill
"February 4, 2010",Stefanie Kline,4.0,,This is the 3rd brewstation we have purchased and we love the fact that we can just get one cup at a time.  The coffee brews nicely and doesn't ever taste burnt or bitter even after being on for 4 hours.  The spout does need to be further out from the back as it does sometimes spill down the back...this is why I give it a 4 star and not a 5.  I am willing to put up with this becuase I love the rest of it!
"August 28, 2019",L. Gunter,5.0,,My favorite coffee pot
"February 1, 2016",Lea,4.0,One,This is a good everyday coffeemaker. It's nice if you have time to wait for it to brew because it's not the fastest coffee maker in the world. I enjoy the programmable feature as well as the basket carafe. The digital display is easy to read and it's easy to use. Cleaning is also simple. It is a little bulky if you have a limited amount of counter space. Overall a nice machine.
"August 18, 2020",Noelle,1.0,,The coffee maker leaked.
"October 22, 2019",ChrisM,2.0,,Worked well for about 2 weeks then the steam started pouring out of the perk spot and it is taking up to an hour to percolate 8 cups. There is so much steam that 8 cups turns into less than 4 perked cups.
"January 6, 2020",Taylor Lee,5.0,,I’ve had this machine for a few years now. It works amazing and my coffee is always delicious and hot. I will be ordering another soon. I’ve had trouble keeping it clean but I’m not very great at cleaning as it is.
"December 29, 2018",Shelly,3.0,,"It's a good coffee maker, much easier to use than regular coffee makers. I'm disappointed in how fast the paint has come off, I've also had to unplug it to reset it because it stopped brewing in the middle of a pot I just put on. Not sure what happened. It seems pretty cheaply made."
"June 3, 2021",Eric Gurholt,1.0,,"Bought this coffee pot twice now and after the first month, it stops brewing and will only brew half a pot of coffee.  Would not recommend and have had to return this coffee pot twice now and am moving onto a new brand."

"February 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I am beyond happy with my purchase. The best part about the whole thing is there is NO coffee pot 👌 Its perfect. All parts that need actual cleaning, detach and can be clean easily in the sink. No more spills, drips, broken glass etc"
"May 29, 2020",Debbie,5.0,,Love my new coffee maker
"May 8, 2020",NanaPink831,1.0,,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! THE BUTTON BROKE HALF WAY THROUGH THE FIRST CUP!!!
"March 12, 2021",Jack Bower,2.0,,The coffee maker drains down the back leaving coffee under the maker. I would advise against buying.
"October 31, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"it is defective, wont work"
"September 19, 2016",Joseph,4.0,,"This is a very nice product. The seller did a great job getting it out to me on time. As for the description, which I am certain is out of the hands of the seller themselves and controlled by the distributor, could be more specific. Such as it's dimensions / mainly the height. It will not fit under our cabinets as far as opening, filling and adding grounds."
"May 11, 2017",Candela Gonzalez Fiol,2.0,,The coffee dispenser concept is great! I used it for less than a month and I loved it. Until one morning it did not work anymore and goblin inside of me asking for a Caffeinated beverage got pissed and wanted to send the coffee maker back in one kick.
"August 5, 2019",Mariah,1.0,,I wanted so badly to like this coffee maker but it’s really hard to get a good cup of coffee out of it. It’s either too watered down or way too bitter. I’ve had it for about a month and a half and I’ve managed to make one cup that tasted ok.
"February 28, 2019",Michael,5.0,,I use the appliance daily sometimes many times throughout. it always operates correctly. The dispenser is nice
"December 20, 2017",Diane,3.0,One,"Love the pot, but we've had to replace it EVERY SINGLE YEAR for 4 years in a row because it starts leaking everytime right at about 1 year!!!"
"September 25, 2014",John K.,1.0,One,"We've had this for about a month now.  It does leak into the lower half of the maker... just under the reservoir.  That isn't a huge deal to me.  What is a huge deal?  It gets WAY too hot... as in the 2nd cup of coffee literally has a distinct melted plastic taste to it.  The next day, the auto shut-off failed.  It continued to stay extremely hot for hours unbeknownst to me.  The filter and coffee grounds became extremely dry and the paper was burnt black all around the edges.  I realized this after my kids complained of a burning smell in the house.  This coffee maker is absolutely a safety hazard, and I cannot recommend against buying enough."
"March 7, 2021",Drecia A. Grant,5.0,,"For people who  the shakes and break carafes, this pot is wonderful. this is my fourth pot.They dont seem to last more the four years."
"January 22, 2015",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"This is the 3rd one of these we've owned.  They last a fairly long time, the last one was about 5 years.  I bought this for my husband for Christmas to replace the last one.  He loves it!!  It's programmable so he has hot coffee when he gets up in the morning.  The one had ""pouring"" is perfect."
"March 11, 2018",K BREDAHL,5.0,,I love NOT having a carafe to drop. My first unit gave years of service. This is my second purchase.
"January 12, 2011",psblin,4.0,3,I love this unit. Just push the bar and you have coffee. I tend to not have much light in my kitchen in the morning and if I am using a dark cup it can be difficult to see the cup filling. The fill bar could be a little lower. Loading this unit is a little messy as you have to remove two compartments that are wet but mine is right next to the sink. Would I buy this again? Hands down!
"July 1, 2018",Rebecca,5.0,,"Perfect cup for 4 hours, wow!!!"
"March 4, 2016",T. Brown,5.0,,"Have had a Keurig for a number of years and the older models worked just fine.  Bought a 2.0 and have nothing but trouble.  Have to clean the grounds out of the needle again and again.  Bought this Brewstation and some French Market coffee and have been living happily ever since. It brews properly, doesn't burn the coffee but keeps it hot and I'm satisfied.  Good product!"
"May 31, 2020",Tara Foulk,1.0,,Have only had this coffee pot 2 weeks and it is already broke.  It is only running 4 cups of coffee and then shuts off.
"January 29, 2018",Elizabeth Copeland,5.0,,Our old hamilton beach coffee maker finally gave up the ghost. I love that the water dispenser of this is removable. Makes it less of a mess when the hubs is getting coffee ready for the next day!
"March 11, 2018",Rick Shanklin,1.0,,Awful!  Plastic tab on water reservoir broke the first day.  Less than 3 months old and leaks coffee all over the counter.  Going in the trash!!
"December 4, 2019",Tammy Cady,5.0,,We love this!  Having the tank instead of a glass coffee pot is soooo much easier!  And we love pushing the dispenser button instead of pouring. Two thumbs up!
"April 8, 2019",Jabber Ann,1.0,,"We have owned four of these coffee makers and have been pleased with them, however, this one is so terribly noisy that we have to put it in the laundry room  We are just dealing with it rather than packing it up and sending it back."
"October 15, 2018",Sasha,5.0,,I like how easy this machine is to use and clean and it works great and keeps the coffee hot
"March 20, 2021",Dana Horner,4.0,,We really like the ease of use with this coffee maker. Unfortunately it leaks. We emailed directly to HB but never received response.
"January 18, 2019",leonel cuellar,5.0,,one of the best ones you've bought
"April 24, 2017",Amy,2.0,,"Since using this coffee machine, I have never had a hot cup of coffee. I just dealt with it, and reheated in the microwave.  The coffee also dribbles out from the dispenser, which I have to wipe up every time I fill my mug up.  After 4 years, the machine is no longer working and I will definitely not buy a coffee machine from Hamilton Beach again."
"January 15, 2017",Patricia Root,2.0,One,Not what i expected. Wish I could return it. used it for the first time during the holidays. It was a nuisance for me. I want to see my coffee.
"June 27, 2019",John W.Arzberger,5.0,,I really like this coffee maker keeps coffee hot.  Very easy to use.  Coffee flavor is fantastic
"May 28, 2020",Kenneth J. Rogers Sr.,2.0,,Frequently does not brew all the water through and has to be restarted to finish. Repeatedly followed manufacturers cleaning instructions without results.
"December 20, 2019",Auguste P Joseph,5.0,,"It's very easy to set up, use and clean. Setup at night and wake up to fresh coffee that you can pour straight into your travel mug or mug, whatever your preference may be."
"December 16, 2019",Jo Jo,5.0,,Water reservoir detected so you can fill it in sink. No glass carafe that can break. Coffee stays hot. Easy to clean. Makes great ice coffee too!
"March 31, 2020",Josh F. Chavol,5.0,,Keeps coffee fresh for 4 hours
"July 14, 2016",Audrey,3.0,,"We like that we do not have to mess with a carafe; however, we do not like that there is water that leaks into the chamber where the coffee dispenses.  I know its from the condensation from the steam, but every fourth or fifth time we use the machine, I have to dump out this water. Clearly a design error and I expected more from Hamilton Beach."
"July 10, 2014",Tawnya Sidwell,2.0,,"I bought this coffee maker three months ago and it was great at first. However, many insulated coffee mugs don't fit into the dispenser and it stops brewing after 4 cups even though water reservoir was filled for 12. It requires shutting the unit off and turning it back on to finish brewing... Headache at 6 am, no thank you."
"November 14, 2018",Honin,3.0,,"Has many nice features...but the coffee is not hot enough. May be fine, if you drink it black. I purchased this for our meeting room and am thinking of replacing it."
"November 29, 2014",Matt and Michelle James,4.0,One,"We bought this about a month ago.  For the first few weeks our coffee had a kind of plastic taste to it.  Finally we boiled plain water and let it sit in the coffee container until it cooled.  After a few rounds, the plastic taste disappeared.  Now we love it!  Coffee tastes great and stays hot.  It also looks great on the counter."
"December 14, 2020",Sandy Duncan,1.0,,The dispensing of the coffee is NOT a neat process! Dribbles down the front of the machine and back of your cup! This flaw should have been corrected in product development. I should have heeded the prior reviews. Would not buy again or recommend.
"February 17, 2014",Jetjock,5.0,One,"this coffee maker is so much easier to use than any other we have tried. at first it made bubbling sounds but after a few days the sounds got softer and now we barely hear it. when we want a refill, we can just press cup against the button and get exactly what we want and know that it is the right temperature every time."
"May 4, 2017",MnD,5.0,,"So far we love this coffee maker. No carafe to break, the coffee is delicious (same brand has a much smoother taste than when brewed with our last coffee maker) and it looks great under my cabinet on my counter! I would certainly buy this again!"
"July 8, 2021",Lisa,1.0,,"Waste  of money. Awful coffee maker, sloppy to fill, takes forever to brew and coffee dispenser malfunctions. Won't  by brand again."
"July 5, 2021",Douglas A.,1.0,,After having this for only 6 months it's leaking and the coffee doesn't taste as fresh as it should for how little time I've had it.
"February 1, 2017",BlueFug8,5.0,,"Best.thing.ever. You can program it to start at whatever time you like and it'll keep your coffee nice and hot for up to 4 hours. You choose the brew strength. You can totally make iced coffee. And, only dispense what you need. Total win!"
"March 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I wouldn’t use any other brand. I have one in my kitchen and one in my camper
"November 8, 2013",Val,5.0,,"Once I did a test run for flavor preference, I'm loving this coffee maker!  The fact that I no longer have to go in search of replacement carafes AND the ease of selecting how long I want it to keep my coffee warm AND if I prefer a bolder brew, it's GREAT!  I highly recommend this to anyone in need of a new coffee maker."
"February 2, 2019",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"Instructions could be better re: setting the timer, but works very good. No leaks or any other problems. Excellent machine so far!"
"July 20, 2020",Zabdy Meza,1.0,,"The first two weeks we had this coffee maker it work super well, but after it started acting up, and now it stops working once it brews two cups of coffee even though we want all 12 cups made. I regret buying this product, I do not recommend."
"December 7, 2018",patty brown,5.0,,"So glad I purchased this coffeemaker...  easy to load with the removable water reservoir. I have bad shoulders, and this makes it so much easier to make!"
"July 20, 2020",J_Aldredge,5.0,,Good clean design.
"December 6, 2020",Ismat,5.0,,Absolutely love this coffee machine. I usually drink quite a bit of coffee throughout the day and hate constantly microwaving a cup. This keeps the coffee hot so whenever I want more it’s ready to go.
"December 31, 2013",Sarah Henderson,4.0,One,"I bought this to replace a Keurig that died and also never made ""hot"" coffee. I purchased this one on the recommendations of other reviews that stated it actually gave you ""hot"" coffee and that the coffee does not taste burnt after sitting for hours being kept warm. I agree that it produces hot coffee if the coffee has been sitting for at least 15 mins or longer and the heating element has heated it up. If you get a cup as its brewing or right after it's probably hot enough for most people but I do have to put my cup in the microwave. I love being able to get coffee as soon as there is some ready. I have no problem with the dispenser bar as some had stated. Overall its great. It will be a money saver compared to the kcups with Keurig."
"March 30, 2010",Keri McDermott,4.0,2,"I had a traditional 12 cup coffee maker and I was tired of the burnt taste and scalding of the pot. This product is great coffee tastes fresh all the time, I love the ability to keep it warm for up to 4hrs...and that I can program to have my coffee ready for me every morning when I wake up. My only issue is that when you have filled your cup and pull the cup away the coffee always seems to run down the side of the cup. This product is easy to clean and is very sleek in design. I highly recommend this product."
"July 28, 2017",Nancy L.,5.0,,I love not having to wash a coffee pot.  The holding tank and basket are very easy to remove for cleaning and the water holding tank is removeable which makes filling easy.
"December 4, 2017",Grannycasp,5.0,,Great coffee maker.  I had a Braun before.  This one is just as good for a lot less money.
"January 18, 2019",Nitsud816,5.0,,One Of the best Coffee makers out there
"February 12, 2021",SAMI Smith,5.0,,Leaks under the unit. I exchanged it and that one leaked too. Would not recommend
"February 19, 2021",Kevin Eppley,1.0,,Started leaking all over after 3 months. Of course the return date had passed. Stuck with it now. To the trash it goes.
"January 11, 2017",Smiley,4.0,One,"Giving it 4 stars because I can't give it 4.5 stars as it deserves.  This is my 4th or 5th Brewstation.  I buy one every 2 years.  That is about how long they last.  I keep buying them because it makes great coffee and keeps it fresh for about 8 hours before the coffee gets bitter.  I make a pot in the morning and drink it all day.  After 2 years, it starts to leak at the pour spout and that is the beginning of the end.  I bought the last one for $43 but Amazon had the same pot for as much as $119 so shop around on the Amazon.com for best price.  At $43 for a pot that lasts about 24 months, great coffee for less than $2 per month. The previous model allowed me to restart the 4 hour timer by turning the pot off them back on.  This model forces me to add a half cup of water then turning back on.  Not too big of a hassle to keep the coffee hot for 4 more hours. I have 2 recommendations for the manufacturer.  1) figure out the leak issue; 2) Add a light above the pour spout.  The design of this model eliminates the biggest leak problem, condensation.  Better design than the last one. This model will not accommodate a 14 oz Contiga mug unless the drip pan is removed. The previous model did."
"February 13, 2018",Adrenalynn,5.0,,My first grown up coffee maker and absolutely love it!!!! Great price. Easy to clean. Easy to use to set th me timer. Better than I expected!!
"May 5, 2020",Laura S.,3.0,,"Like most things about this coffee maker. The only major downfall is that, despite the drip catch, coffee pools underneath on my counter, which will stain it if it's not cleaned daily."
"July 28, 2016",Kindle Customer,5.0,One,Love this product. The only downside is water should be poured in the base with something other than the top container because it's hard not to spill it. Love the bold setting and not breaking glass. We've had no problems like others have mentioned.
"March 11, 2021",James Anderson,5.0,,I have had my first one for 3 years and lots of use.  Just purchased another one works great no complaints.
"October 19, 2018",Nana,5.0,,Love this coffee maker!!!!!
"June 17, 2016",Terrance T.,4.0,,"It works well, thus far. Pouring water into the hopper is a little clumsy and we usually slop a little water out. It still gets a little cooked down taste when you leave the coffee in the pot for 2 to 4 hrs. We put coffee in thermos mugs for later use. For the money it's a nice coffee maker."
"May 17, 2019",Lance,1.0,,"I like the premise of this coffee maker but it leaks like a sieve!  You can follow the instructions for cleaning and fixing leaks (why would they even NEED instructions for leaks?!?), but it never fixes the problem. It’s less than six months old and it’s the second one we’ve owned (replaced first for same issue). If you don’t want your countertop constantly flooded with coffee, upgrade to a better machine."
"March 6, 2019",Tia Habeck,2.0,,Works great for making and getting coffee when its freshly made. But reheating the coffee burns it. Also cleaning instructions are unclear and you have to order specialty filters that are not easy to remove.
"March 28, 2021",Shelley Wilson,1.0,,It is leaking but we don’t have time to return it. It works but we have to keep a dish towel under. 😞
"April 16, 2021",Steve Giles,5.0,,my father loves this machine
"January 26, 2017",DanielleAs4,3.0,,"I didn't realize till way after purchasing this item that the bottom of the plastic had broken, it was pretty even looking on both sides so I didn't notice till it started leaking all over the counter. At first we thought it was condensation but as it has gotten worse we realized it's broken.  Still love the features and makes coffee perfectly, sad I got a broken product."
"October 31, 2018",mp,2.0,,Have had to replace already due to leakage around the water receptacle.  Did not last 6 months. Third one of its kind we have had over the last couple of years...went back to the old fashioned glass pot.
"June 27, 2013",KJW,5.0,,"And I haven't had any of the problems mentioned in earlier reviews. I can see the level of coffee in my cup. It doesn't drip or dribble. It keeps my coffee hot for as long as I like without affecting the taste. If I had to complain at all, it would be the difficulty to clean the storage compartment due to all the vertical seams, heat plate and viewing ports, but even that doesn't bother me too much."
"March 30, 2018",Pic7kles,5.0,,Love my coffee and love it more thanks to this machine.
"April 17, 2018",The Bears,5.0,,"Keeps coffee hot up to 4 hours, different brew strength settings, and easy to keep clean. Working perfectly after 5 months of daily use!"
"April 3, 2020",Vern Head,1.0,One,I have had this coffee maker less than 2 months. This morning there was coffee all over the counter and floor. The tank is LEAKING around the hot plate! Very disappointed!!!
"July 4, 2019",Diane J. Everett,5.0,,We love our brewstation by Hamilton Beach.
"September 26, 2019",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"We liked the concept of a ""dispenser"" style coffee maker.  Bottom line,  ""IT LEAKS""  in numerous places.  While dispensing, from the reservoir, where ever it has liquid, it leaks.  Started about 40 days after ownership, now it will be replaced with a stainless carafe style, NOT made by Hamilton Beach."
"February 13, 2017",Snickers,5.0,,"Very well made Coffee Maker and  it earns my five star ratings, Thank You Hamilton Beach and Amazon for such a good products."
"January 16, 2020",JJ,4.0,,This is our second time purchasing a Brew Station. Our first purchase lasted 5+ years so I didn't hesitate to buy another... I really favor the new smaller design and the cold brew option. It's a great coffee pot for it's price & functionality.
"November 26, 2016",Cascades,2.0,,"Got this coffee maker and it worked fine the day I got it, however the next morning I tried to make myself coffee before work and I kept getting a message on the screen saying ""pour water"" despite there already being water in there. I poured out the water and poured some water back in twice and still got the same message. Very unfortunate way to start my day since coffee is what gets me through the work day."
"October 19, 2019",Ronald Foose,1.0,,"does not get hot enough, we have to still put coffee in microwave to get it hot enough. Which make us wonder why we even bought it if we have to use microwave to get it hot. Nor does it even stay hot. Waste of money and really should have returned it."
"December 16, 2020",malo,1.0,,"We had bought this type coffee maker for several years and loved the convenience of it.  However, this one started leaking coffee from the inside after only 4 months.  We decided to replace it with another brand."
"September 30, 2017",Sean,5.0,,"I like to make my coffee strong, this lets me. Nice new touch with the removable side basin. Remember to get the permanent filter with this one, as it doesn't come with like the previous versions."
"October 14, 2019",kathy haas,1.0,,We have only had it since July and it isn’t keeping the coffee hot.  I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.
"April 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"When pouring , it leaks from behind. Had it replaced and the next one is doing the same ."
"August 23, 2018",Imelda Andersen,5.0,One,This is our third coffeemaker of this kind.  We prefer this  style over the carafe style.  The last one started leaking  after 5 or so years.  Works as advertised.
"May 15, 2020",Julie Henning,1.0,,This coffee maker arrived with beaten and ripped box.  The valve holding coffee in container part of the coffee maker leaked the first time it was used.  Never buy this style of maker as it relies totally on this valve working.
"April 5, 2019",Dwayne dawson,5.0,,Really like our coffee pot. We replace a Cuisinart coffee maker of a similar design. This one is superior and far less expensive.  Nice unit.
"September 28, 2014",Studio 54 - E Olson-Hulls,4.0,,I love the brewstation but this model is horrible.  I hate that the water reserve is actually under and it is very hard to pour fresh water in when trying to make a pot of your favorite joe........ water spills all over the counter so i would suggest using a different pitcher as you would get better aim.  I prefer Brew Station model 47665
"April 20, 2013",flippy flop,5.0,,"I bought this to replace a lesser model that was 4 years old that had been very well used. (At least 2 pots of coffee every day) The new one makes a great pot of coffee faster than the old one ever did. I like that there are markers inside the water compartment where you pour the fresh water, my old one didn't have that. Also that the finished coffee comes out twice as fast as the old one. But best of all is the placement of the clock and timer set buttons. On the old model they were low on the machine and in order to read the time or delay brew time I just about had to stand on my head to see the numbers through the bifocal part of my glasses. And that area was not lit up on any way. The new coffee maker has the time/brew time near the top, center and it is lit up and is very easy to read. Some of the reviews said it was hard to push the bar that releases the coffee into your cup. I just don't get what the complaint is. I use big, 20 ounce, coffee cups. This maker has room for the cup and with just a push, the coffee is released onto the cup. I love this coffee maker, and if anything goes wrong, or we wear it out, I'll replace it with another of the same."
"November 4, 2020",Ilene H,5.0,,We replaced our old Hamilton Beach coffee maker after 7 years when it stopped worked. This is the same one we had and loved. Prepares a great cup of coffee. It's easy to use and to clean. Great price.
"July 7, 2016",Kevin and Tracey Y.,2.0,,I purchased this product two months ago and it worked perfectly until the coffee tank started leaking the other day. Now I am unable to use it because the leaking causes the coffee to leak out into the water reservoir.
"December 30, 2016",Firebird,5.0,2,"Works as described. It will not last as long as a carafe option, but it is very handy yo just push cup up to dispense . Our other unit started leaking after 5 years, so it is worth the price."
"June 13, 2019",Karen campion,4.0,,"Nice coffee maker, but is cheaply made. Grate at base is only about 1/4 inch thick. Just flops around. Also maker needs to be against wall to tap coffee with one hand or you need to hold the back if it’s not against the wall because it will slid back"
"March 20, 2018",Colleen Babbitt,5.0,,"I absolutely love this pot. I had one years ago and once the heat element stopped working,they replaced it for free. It had already been 2 years too. So I bought it again,here,for the best price I've seen."
"January 6, 2014",Jonsubo,3.0,One,"Brews great coffee. I love mine but it takes forever to reheat coffee and an unfortunate over look feature. Cannot set time start reheat coffee. Flashes to add water. So just brew what you need and microwave to reheat the rest. A few things save this coffe maker, first the design it just looks cool. I love the push to dispense feature. It brews great coffee that tastes the same 3 hours after sitting a keeping hot. Best feature ever."
"December 20, 2020",Cindy mccoy,5.0,,Love this coffee pot works great
"December 10, 2018",Cheryl Palumbo,5.0,,Love this new style coffee machine works great stores coffee inside so no need for single cups and then pots too saves counter space
"August 30, 2019",Gamer_Boi27,5.0,,Great product for a great price.
"June 11, 2021",Jerry,3.0,,The problem is the screws were all loose on the bowl. Ones prior were good. This created a problem with the gasket. Finally got it repaired.
"February 5, 2014",Paula Jay,5.0,,"After contemplating which one to buy, I couldn’t have made a better choice.  From the sleek design to the ease of operating this coffee maker is the greatest. Love how the parts are easy to take apart and put back in. The features are just what I wanted. Easy to operate, and makes excellent coffee. I like the keep warm feature too. I am so happy I picked this model, with its silver front design, looks so good on my counter. Hamilton Beach really did their homework when they designed this coffee maker! I would definitely recommend this coffee maker, and I give it five stars."
"January 16, 2013",Dawna Lindley,5.0,,"This is our second Brewstation - and we love it.  Great change was made with the reservoir that holds the water - it's much bigger and in the main part of the machine so it is SO MUCH EASIER TO FILL!  Easy to program and looks nice on the counter.  Also, we like that we are able to fill taller ""to-go"" mugs with this model."
"March 2, 2016",Aa. in NorCal,3.0,,"I have had this for just over a month; I'm only giving a 3 but i'll explain. I LOVE the actual coffee, its always fresh and well fresh. I really do like the concept and the ability to get into the makers 3 main parts and clean it (the key to fresh coffee is a very clean pot). I like the idea and execution of no actual coffee pot, also having 3 main removable components has allowed for ""lesser"" able coffee makers in my home (sorry babe) to make coffee without a critical error of adding grinds in little small places they don't belong that directly contributed to a massive failure of my MUCH more expensive maker. Finally I liked the price. So why a 3? Heres why. The design is ""loose"" with little weird edges and seams that don't fit right. Also the steam produced condenses into... wait for it... Water. When you open the lid the next morning or late at night to set it up for a morning ""on"" time, it literally spills water all over the counter and down the back of the maker where the electronics are. TOTALLY unacceptable. The other MAJOR problem is the feet don't hold well and when you go to pour your coffee the maker slides away from you unless its already banked against a wall or backsplash. I'm keeping the maker for now because of the quality of the final product but will for sure NOT be buying another one made by Hamilton Beach. I'd rather spend a bit more and get another better made maker and teach my love how to barista without error."
"May 4, 2019",All-access Customer,5.0,,We've gone through 3 over the years.
"November 17, 2019",Boweak,1.0,,This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned.  Within 15 minutes of the coffee brewing it tastes burnt and it is not the type of coffee beans.  I have tried to return it with Hamilton Beach and they are making it very difficult to return the item under the warranty.
"November 30, 2019",Beth D,5.0,,Love love love
"August 8, 2018",Kimberly Diede,5.0,,THANKS
"August 20, 2019",Speedline Team Sports,5.0,,It's Great
"February 13, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Coffee taste great. Keeps it warm,but leaks all over. Hamilton Beach is not taking phone calls at this time so you have to email them. Still waiting for a response.  Would not recommend!!"
"May 5, 2018",Jeanne Dunning,2.0,,"I am very disappointed in this product. We have had the same coffee maker foe five years. When it began to leak, I ordered a new one, same model. We have had it for about two weeks and it leaked coffee from the start and is getting worse. Plan to return it and try something different. Sorry because I really liked the convenience of this design."
"January 10, 2020",Joyce ham,5.0,,Easy to use.. Took some getting use to but it's awesome...
"February 28, 2019",Mary Reese,5.0,,"This is an awesome coffee maker. It also works well as a kettle. I love huge the internal pot, it makes dispensing easy and there's no glass to break!"
"December 20, 2019",Brenda Landers,5.0,,I love this Brew 🚉. The process is so quick and easy.
"December 26, 2012",JonesyJones,5.0,,When our antique coffee maker broke we purchased this Brewstation from Amazon.  I wish I had bought it long before we did because now I can have the hot coffee waiting for me when I get up in the morning.  We've used it for a month now and I couldn't be happier ~ quick shipping ~ works well ~ I have already recommend it to my family and friends.
"April 20, 2016",Mamma C.,1.0,3,"This coffee pot may work for you, but here's why it didn't work for me: 1. You have to remove the entire inside upper components to add water. 2. Very short plug, and, in combination with gripe #1, made it near impossible to slide the maker out from under my cabinets near impossible where I needed it to be placed. 2. There is no gauge to see how much coffee is left in the internal pot. Too much of a surprise factor, which I can't accommodate for when using this for parties/hosting. 3. The catch basin is not large enough to set a coffee cup down (normal size cup) when filling. 4. The coffee is dispensed from the pot by pressing a button on the inside of the center column, not by a lever. There were too many dislikes for me to try and like this for the low price point. I returned it in exchange for Cuisinart DCC-3000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. (Which fits the bill exactly.)"
"February 11, 2019",Lisa Wharton,5.0,,"I think I've bought 4 in 10 years because its constantly being used in my house. But I love it! No carafe, easy to grab a cup and go!"
"May 8, 2017",Gary R. Bressler,5.0,,Our old one of many years died and this is an exact replacement.  I like dispensing right into my cup.  It's easy to clean and makes great coffee.
"July 28, 2013",T. Turner,4.0,One,I was concerned about the reviews regarding not being able to see and having spills. I fill my 16 ounce travel cup without a problem. It doesn't fit under so I fill it on angel and can see when it is full. It programs easily and have woken up to my coffee every morning without a problem. It keeps the coffee HOT for four hours when I choose the 4 hour setting. I can easily reset the time to keep it warm. No regrets here.
"February 4, 2020",ashdash,5.0,,we absolutely love this coffee maker!
"July 26, 2016",Rebe E.,4.0,2,Love it but it's very messy. Condensation drips down when you open the lid to take out the big filter basket and then the filter basket kind of drips all over the place too but I really do like the overall design.
"January 6, 2020",Brian E. McElmeel,5.0,,I’ve owned a few of these pots and love the easy dispensing of each cup. Makes a great cuppa coffee. Keeps the coffee hot but not with a burned smell or flavor.  This is the only pot I will buy.
"February 8, 2016",bridgetadw,5.0,,"We love this thing.  Its the best thing ever, per my husband.  this is our second one because I broke our first when I dropped the water resevoir.  It was 2 years old though so it had some staining in the pot so this kept me from having to clean it- and get a new one!"
"January 6, 2020",Pamela Jarkowski,3.0,,"Easy to use, however the maker is loud and continues to be loud after the coffee is already made."
"July 4, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I got tired of the design of most coffee makers carafes that spilled coffee on my counter while pouring into my cup over 18 years ago. Hamilton Beach BrewStation changed all that with the fool proof dispenser , just press your cup against the bar and watch the delicious coffee fill it up !"
"January 26, 2017",Katy B.,5.0,One,Had one of these for years before it started to wear out.  The new one is awesome.  Plastic pieces come off so you can run them through the dishwasher.  Would recommend to anyone looking for something like this model.
"July 28, 2018",Anthony,5.0,,"I don't drink coffee personally, I bought this for guests.  Everyone loves this thing.  The internal brew design which allows you to poor py pressing your cup against the back stop/button - perfect...."
"February 14, 2020",Patricia W.,5.0,,Love this coffee maker so easy to use.
"January 17, 2020",Brandie N Dodd,5.0,,Easy to use. Directions easy to understand. Easy setup. Keeps coffee warm for a long time.
"July 16, 2016",A. Reader,4.0,,"I had this coffeemaker for years longer than any other, until the push button no longer worked. So I bought the same exact one at a really reasonable price. No glass carafe to break. Looks sleek. Lost one star because pouring the water into the pot is a little awkward. But otherwise I do recommend it."
"June 4, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Just bought my second one. Biggest thing I like is the 4 hour warm option - I drink coffee all morning! First one last around 3 years making an average of one full 12 cups a day.
"September 20, 2019",Gary L. Burgess,3.0,,The dispenser lever is defective on this unit. My previous coffee maker like this one started leaking water after two years. This is probably my last Hamilton Beach coffee maker.
"May 25, 2021",Steve Lott,4.0,,This is the second one we bought. The first lasted us many years before one of the seals finally wore out. Would buy another in a second.
"April 8, 2017",MamaDukes,3.0,,Getting coffee is easy however cleaning and preparing coffee is not easy at all.  After the hot coffee has sit awhile it tends to taste burnt.  I will keep it and use it due to the cost of the coffee maker.  I wouldn't buy another one.
"January 30, 2021",Carol L. Carpenter,5.0,,This is the greatest coffee pot. It's easy to use and clean.
"November 7, 2015",MeganInMN,5.0,,"LOVE this coffee maker! It's so nice to not have to deal with a pot, but still be able to make a pot's worth of coffee at once. It's like the best of both worlds between a regular coffee maker and a keurig!"
"September 19, 2019",lbk,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. It keeps the coffee hot, can be programmed and there is no carafe to break."
"June 15, 2018",SweetDanger7,5.0,,The Coffee Pot is working well.. No problem with it ... I would buy again... As I did... Had one like it before for a long time and then couldn't purchase another one like it for awhile... It's a nice Coffee Pot to have and easy to use ....
"March 2, 2021",Tracy Delaney,3.0,,The warmer doesn’t keep it warm - it continues to cook it and after an hour being on warm the coffee taste burnt. It’s easy to clean and easy to fill. After the coffee is made - turn it off then the coffee taste fine.
"December 14, 2019",KG1116,5.0,,Second one.  A little louder then the last one. Makes great coffee and no annoying beeps when ready.
"July 26, 2018",Timothy R. Collins and Dorheidy Collins,1.0,,"This one was defective, bought it on May 22/18, and has been leaking coffee all over. I have been using the type of coffee makers for years, and this one was a ""lemon"""
"March 14, 2016",Stephen C. Holtzman,5.0,162,"WOW what a deal! When I received notice of The Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Coffee Maker on sale, I read the reviews and decided to purchase it. I finally used it today and was very very impressed. I used Santo Domingo ground coffee and it was exactly as I wanted. I followed all the instructions and l cleaned the machine before using it. I then proceeded to fill the carrying tank with water for 12 cups, poured it into the machine placed the empty tank on top, inserted the filter and placed seven heaping tablespoons into the filter. Closed the container, pressed the strong brew and on button. Minutes later a very full body and hot mug of coffee. What I love the most was the fact that there is no carafe! The coffee is brewed inside and stored by a warming place for up to four hours. It kept it hot! Being able to take a mug or a cup and just pour what you want is such a great idea and it works well. At the end, when we were finished all 12 cups, cleanup was simple and we set the machine on to a timer for tomorrow morning. Very pleased with this machine and you will as well."
"July 1, 2020",Frank Castle,1.0,,Terrible.  Started leaking within 2 weeks of use.  Seems to be a design flaw where the heating element meets the internal reservoir.  Seeps around the gasket and out the bottom.
"August 22, 2020",April Kingsmore,1.0,,I bought my coffee pot on June 4th 2020 and it just started leaking terribly. The coffee pot hasn’t moved since we bought it! I’ve contacted customer service and haven’t heard a word. Very unhappy customer!
"January 13, 2021",danny cagle,1.0,,This was my 3rd coffee maker all the same brand. It leaks from where you pour your coffee I will never buy this brand again
"July 31, 2020",LeeAnne Foulk,5.0,,"This is the second one of these we've purchased. This was to replace the first bc the digital display was going out. We'd had that thing for years. We love the timer, keep warm, and dispensing features."
"August 23, 2016",Phillip Hamilton,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. It is really nice, works great and keeps coffee warm without burning for hours. It is a little hard to fill with water, but no harder to deal with than pot coffee makers and no real cleanup."
"January 3, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"This is a great coffee makers, easy to use, i like the way the coffee stays hot and it is an easy pour right from the machine. I would highly recommend it."
"July 4, 2020",Judy L Greener,1.0,,"This is not a good coffee maker, we bought one and it leaked every cup poured, we returned it and got another same maker and it leaked even worse, when you place your cup to fill, coffee keeps coming out after removing your cup! Unable to return second maker, there is no return label."
"January 4, 2020",Ronald,5.0,,We used this same version many years ago then switched to the other version. Needless to say we've gone back to the original version.
"March 12, 2021",Samantha Smith,5.0,,Very easy to use. And clean. And fill...and stuff.
"July 15, 2019",Kymmieinelma,5.0,,We have an office out of seven people. I love that keeps the coffee hot throughout the day. It's perfect!
"June 5, 2021",THendricksen,3.0,,I like the lighted cup area. I like the coffee gage. We like the capacity. Don’t like the reservoir
"October 19, 2015",Danielle Brannan,4.0,,Love having hot coffee at the ready without worrying about a carafe. It's easy to use and the programmable feature has made our morning routine more efficient. I wish my travel mug fit more easily under the spout; as it is I need to tilt it at an angle and can't tell when my mug is fill which has caused a couple of spills.
"October 2, 2016",Bargn Hntr,2.0,,"Update to original review. Well it didn't even last a year. Mine died in April, 10 months after purchase, so not very good. Overnight it went from brewing a pot in 15 to 20 minutes to taking 1.5 hours to brew a pot. No it is not dirty. It was cleaned weekly and with vinegar monthly, and the need cleaning notifier was not saying it needed cleaning either. Plus before giving up on it I thoroughly cleaned it including the water tube inside and any part I could reach without tools. No impact. I started making a lot more bubbling sounds and my guess it the heating element was having issues. In any case, not worth the money for me; I expect 3 years minimum. Original review. I would have loved to give this more stars. Only 2 things prevented me. First, filling travel mugs is a real pain in the neck. You can't see how full the cup is getting, so you're constantly pulling the cup away to check it. Well unless you're my wife; she just let it go until it over flowed everywhere, but that's her way. Second, it can be a bit messy to use. You must remove the filter basket, then remove the water/coffee bin each time. And of course they both drip everywhere. Then you have to fill the bin and bring it back to the coffee maker and pour the water into the water tank. This can be a bit challenging as it will overflow if you're not paying strict attention, because the tank doesn't have a mark on it to tell you when to stop, and it would appear to be capable of holding more water than it actually does. Overall the coffee maker works fine, but using it seems to be more work than it needs to be. On the good side, it is super easy to program and keeps the coffee piping hot up to for hours without burning it. You can even easily set brew strength to regular or bold. The bold is great! With that in mind I guess I'll give it 4 stars after all."
"November 10, 2018",Dusty,5.0,,easy to use. makes good coffee.
"September 23, 2018",Erica Jade,5.0,,I most enjoy GP the pour directly into the cup feature. It’s very easy to clean. The coffee is more hot than before on the second cup. Five stars
"June 29, 2013",Kathy,5.0,One,Best coffeemaker we have ever owned!!  Best cup of coffee for sure.  Wonderful design -- easy to make the coffee in the morning.  comes out steaming hot. And no more messy pot to deal with.  We let it keep hot for 4 hours and there's no burn taste or evaporation.  Its a really wonderful product.  I highly recommend to coffee drinkers everywhere.
"January 4, 2021",Jo Hanson,5.0,,"So nice not to mess with a carafe!  This was a gift, but I've had 2 myself.  Great product!"
"February 14, 2016",Sarah B,4.0,One,I really like this coffee pot as it is so different than anything i've ever owned.  I gave it 4 stars b/c it does still give coffee a burned taste...  Typically though the coffee is delicious.
"April 24, 2019",Linda Villanueva,4.0,,Like this coffeemaker. One touch pour.
"June 24, 2017",Peggy J. Weyer,5.0,,This is my 3rd one of this brand & style. Love the new design. Plus it handles the taller to go mugs. Much better than the previous ones. Super easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone!
"September 25, 2019",Jay,5.0,,Works awesome
"March 8, 2020",Terry,2.0,,For some reason it stops purculating at 4-6 cups when full.  I have to turn off and restart it several times until it finishes.  Note:  I have hard water but this happens also after a complete cleaning.
"March 4, 2016",Mary K. Smalley,5.0,,We love this coffee maker.  We have been using this model for many years.  We were delighted to find a new one on Amazon.  We like the fact of no pot to break.  It makes good coffee and keeps it hot as long as wanted.
"August 11, 2018",Melissa Ainsley,5.0,,I love this coffee maker!  It makes good coffee fast.  It's easy to use & clean.  I asked friends for recommendations & many suggested this one.  Can't beat the price either.  Pleasantly surprised!
"May 19, 2021",gregory keeton,1.0,,coffee went under holding devise and burned on the heating element.
"November 4, 2018",Globalkooler,1.0,,"Purchased in Dec. 2017, failed October 2018. Didn’t even last one year."
"May 13, 2018",Mr. Militant Negro,5.0,,"This machine is fantastic. It does exactly what it's advertised to do, brew coffee with no fuss or mess. The holding chamber erases a need for a carafe and thats very good for me. Coffee stays hot for up to 4 hours and I mean H.O.T. I recommend this as a great investment."
"August 17, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Do not buy.  The first two weeks it worked great, after that the bottom started leaking.  I spoke with a rep. from amazon, and they told me they could not help me to contact the maker of the coffee maker."
"June 17, 2019",Stephen E Eckart,5.0,,Excellent for our 2-3 pots per day-always hot and tasty!!
"May 12, 2021",Carole Matreci,3.0,,this coffee pot does not keep the coffee very hot onces its finished brewing
"March 6, 2020",Sandra Evans,5.0,,Love it
"February 15, 2019",Vivian Acott,1.0,,This coffee maker continually heats the pad causing the coffee to boil. I've owned Hamilton Beach BrewStations before without issue. I would send back for a refund but waited too long.
"January 14, 2020",Michelle Barwick,5.0,,"After quite a bit of research, we decided on this one and glad we did. I love everything about this coffee maker & its functionality."
"December 2, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,I've never had a coffee pot where there is a big pool of oil on top. I've cleaned it multiple times but always the same thing. After about a month we threw it away. Gross.
"November 27, 2020",Arron,4.0,,Works as designed but as others mentioned it is a bit light so it will move easily. No big deal for me as it is against counter wall.
"May 8, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love this pot
"November 15, 2019",adluna,5.0,,Love the removal water container
"January 18, 2016",Slippednfell,4.0,,"I love that I can set the timer for this to go off by itself.  I love that I can pick how long to keep the coffee hot.  I hate that on the rare occasion I want to keep it warmer longer, I can't seem to just turn it back on and have it keep warm without trying to brew an empty reservoir."
"January 11, 2018",Jill Carllove,5.0,,"Got it as a Christmas gift for a friend and all I hear are great raves about how cool it is! I said he needs to bring it over so I can check it out! He said ""no, because you'll want to keep it""!!! Lol"
"August 10, 2015",RC2,5.0,,"Bought this to replace a traditional carafe coffee pot. Does a great job brewing the coffee and then keeping it nice an hot. The warm time is a nice addition so as not to burn the station out. Family enjoys the simplicity of holding their cup under the dispenser and getting a fresh, hot cup of coffee."
"February 3, 2017",MAY,3.0,,"Normally I would have given this product 5 stars.  I have had brew stations before and they have always made it a couple years before they started showing constant use. This one only made it 5 months.  So sad, and upsetting.  Dispensing problems. Still cooks but won't dispense the coffee."
"March 5, 2020",RAYMOND M.,5.0,,Buen regalo
"January 3, 2020",Ellen,5.0,,Love it! Fresh coffee at your fingertips.
"September 7, 2020",cindy quebedeaux,1.0,,This has to be the worst coffeemaker that I have every used!!!  I have bought many Hamilton Beach Brew stations.  This one leaks coffee every time you get a cup of coffee. Make a mess on the counter top.
"May 30, 2017",mister eli,4.0,,It broke after a couple of years. But given the price it doesn't surprise me. Overall we loved how compact it was. We would buy it again.
"December 20, 2018",Woolieart,5.0,,"Replaced the old one we had for years. This is easier to clean, looks nice and I like that I can select the keep warm time to over 2 hours."
"June 20, 2021",martin otto,1.0,,It would leak constantly
"December 20, 2020",Edward Klopp,5.0,,This is a good coffee maker which is relatively easy to clean.  Set-up and programming are easy.  The coffee it produces is just as good as the water and beans you use.  We like it very much.
"May 4, 2020",Melissa Cooper,2.0,,"Already not hot when it brews 10 days!  Had to order the old standby, Mr. Coffee. Hopefully will last more than 10 days. I did like the ""no pot"" idea...just didn't hold up."
"February 18, 2020",Traci Sepulvado,5.0,,I love it! Like that I can just put my cup under it and push button instead of picking up a pot and pouring
"October 11, 2014",muddymucker,5.0,,"LOVE this coffee pot! I had a Keurig but decided it was time to go with ""cheaper"" coffee and bought this not 100% sure I was ready to give up my keurig but now I am glad I did! ALmost didn't purchase it based on negative reviews but thank goodness I didn't let that influence me! It's awesome! I can brew my coffee in the morning, grab a quick cup of coffee, go outside to do chores and come back in and quickly grab another HOT cup of coffee after a few hours! No negatives at all that I have found! It doesn't drip, it works on all my cups and I have some pretty thick cups! It's great!"
"October 10, 2016",snowwin,4.0,One,"Works good so far, only had it about 1 month.  Clean up is not as easily as I'd like though"
"January 18, 2020",Carlos A.,4.0,,"The good— Nice looking brewer, good capacity, coffee is nicely brewed with great flavor The bad— no water filter, noisy even after brewing cycle, display light is super bright at night, bigger than most other dispensing brewers"
"January 20, 2016",Charles W. Craig,3.0,,"It works ok, but it takes a little getting used to if you're used to the kind with a glass carafe. E.G. you have to take the cup to the coffee maker, you can't take the coffee pot to the cup. Otherwise it works fine so far."
"October 19, 2013",ripjack13,1.0,4,"this is the worst coffee maker i have ever bought. it does not hold 12 cups of coffee. even though it says it does. it over flows constantly. when you place your cup on the dispense button it moves the coffee maker backwards. the rubber feet have cracked and fell off as well. get a Cuisinart , it is much better."
"August 5, 2020",robrrt csdotte,1.0,,This is the worst coffee maker I’ve ever had I bought one about 10 years ago and I loved it stopped working so I bought a new one and it leaks all over the place and I missed the window return it because I took it up to my cottage and I didn’t go up until it was Too late
"January 4, 2018",Jeanye,5.0,,"Just what we expected,  works great. Thanks for prompt delivery..."
"January 18, 2017",Annie B,1.0,One,Did not make the cofffee hot enough or keep it warm enough.  The coffee maker lets water sit in the top of the unit and you have to pour it out after every pot you make.  I threw it in the trash after about a week.  Was not worth having to microwave the coffee to make it hot or keep pouring the water out. Def would NOT recommend this to anyone.  Don't waste your money.
"March 17, 2020",Jim,1.0,,8 months old and this thing constantly drips. We've cleaned is thoroughly several times to no avail. its a good concept done cheaply. Don't waste your money.
"May 16, 2016",Pam in Salem,5.0,,"This is an excellent solution if you're fussy about your coffee tasting stale after sitting on the plate for any amount of time (as I am!).  Coffee tastes great, temp is nice and hot (yep, fussy about that too) and stays fresh tasting over time."
"February 15, 2013",Amazon Shopper,4.0,One,"This is my third purchase of this coffee maker.  The only downside is that it requires cleaning often.  I am now using a filter basket in addition to the paper filter to cut down on any coffee grounds escaping where they shouldn't.  Seems to be effective.  Warning: if you don't keep it clean, it won't last long."
"July 21, 2016",R. S. Babb,1.0,,Bought this rebuilt thru Hamilton Beach thought they had solved leaking problem.They have not.Have bought this brand for years I see that they have no idea how to fix or care to fix.This is my last purchase of this brand.
"May 23, 2020",Michael Turner,1.0,,"It leaks every time I fill my cup. When I go to fill my cup, coffee runs down the front of the coffee maker. It goes into the drip tray but it fills up with every cup of coffee and needs emptied"
"May 15, 2020",Tony Costa,1.0,,I have replaced this now because this first one had a horrible humming sound after the coffee was brewed  and now the placement does the same thing.
"July 11, 2021",L.R.,2.0,,box was severly damaged! It was suppose to be a gift. I was so embarrased of the condition. Nobody wants to give a gift that looks like this!😡
"May 23, 2014",StingRay,2.0,,"This is a great idea.  I am trying to find an alternative to the Keurig which is very expensive to buy coffee for.  I got this and it was easy to use and looked nice but, unfortunately, the coffee was not hot enough.  After adding cream I would have to microwave my cup to get the coffee hot enough.  I had to return."
"April 30, 2019",Josh Thompson,3.0,,"Couple spots where it gets delicate and can break, but a lot less dangerous than the traditional glass pots."
"March 22, 2020",Shanika T.,1.0,,The heating area is all plastic coffee was never hot it was always barely warm. I returned it as soon as I got it
"December 16, 2017",Alison - NJ,3.0,,"I loved this coffee maker. so much that I invested in replacing the top part twice and the entire maker - all within 5 years. My second one gave up the ghost one year - one month after warranty ended. I can't keep investing in this product. I'm sad, because otherwise it was a great coffe maker"

"September 21, 2019",Stephanie,5.0,,Works great! Easy to use. Love not having to wait for a whole pot of coffee to be brewed. You can pour yourself a cup right away!
"December 29, 2019",Jennifer,5.0,,Was looking to replace an older molder of this. This is the perfect upgrade! Love this machine! Love that there is a bold button.
"August 16, 2016",Jenni,4.0,,We like this coffee maker but sometimes when we turn it off it pops back on.  We came home from being gone for 8 hours to the smell of burning coffee.  We kept trying to turn it off but immediately turned back on.  We unplugged it for a while then it worked properly.  Otherwise works great.
"January 2, 2020",Jeannie D.,2.0,,I loved this coffee pot but it leaked into the area wher the heater plate was several different times we could not figure out what was wrong. 😒Returned it and did get a full refund 😁
"July 10, 2013",Linda 74,5.0,,"We first experienced the use of the Hamilton Beach Brewstation when we were staying at a condo in Myrtle Beach a few years ago.  There were five adult coffee drinkers so we gave the brewstation quite a workout.  We found that we could access the dispenser even before the brew cycle had completed and all of the coffee was good.  We also liked the fact that there was no pot to clean. If you purchase the Brewstation, make sure that you clean it as recommended.  We have very hard water in our area and it is necessary to use the vinegar cleaning to keep mineral deposits from cloging the works.  It isn't difficult to do and pays off in the long run."
"March 24, 2021",Carolyn McIntire,1.0,,"This is the third one I’ve purchased within a year. Two for me, one for my son. They are all now in the trash. They either leak down the back of your cup or leak water out of the bottom. What a waste of money."
"May 13, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,Everything was great except the leaking.  It had a small stream that ran down behind the cup and filled up the tray constantly.  We exchanged for a new one and it has the same problem.
"December 18, 2019",Katy,2.0,,Please don't buy it leaks water from the bottom
"February 15, 2014",J. R. Lentz,5.0,One,"Best coffee pot I've owned.  I also have a Keurig that makes a great cup of coffee as well, but it's just one cup at a time.  This one makes a whole pot of equivalent quality.  No trouble with leaking or dripping.  Also has a bold setting if you're like me and want a little stronger cup.  Great buy."
"August 4, 2020",Rose Marie Vesek,4.0,,"The one thing I do not like is when you go to get a cup of coffee the bar you push to get it leaks coffee most of the time, but other than that I am satisfied with it."
"December 17, 2019",Gordon Stanton,5.0,,We use it every day
"July 25, 2018",Coopty Loop,1.0,,"I honestly can say that I am shocked by all the good reviews.  This thing is awful!  It is the messiest, hardest to clean coffee maker I have ever had."
"May 18, 2021",Curtis H. Breville,5.0,,We love our BrewStation! This is our 3rd and we have purchased them for friends & family who love their’s too.
"December 11, 2019",daniel west,5.0,,"Easy to clean, simple to use, no glass to deal with, doesn’t burn the coffee. It does exactly what we want it to do and we are very happy with our purchase"
"January 11, 2020",Sharon Clairmont,4.0,,I love this style of coffee maker. The push lever is tight and you need both hands on the coffee maker so it does not slide back too far. Hoping it will loosen up a bit.
"September 11, 2019",Ruby Red,5.0,,Easy to use and makes great coffee.
"February 8, 2014",Joe2014,5.0,One,"Read all the reviews before purchasing.  Shipped on time; packaged great; good instructions; works wonderful; easy to clean.  What I learned from the reviews is, people are very picky.  I don't have any problems with the 'warmer time', being too tall, or problems with filling any of my coffee cups.  I am glad I bought it."
"April 30, 2021",Nyota,2.0,,Like the water on side but coffee does not stay very hot.  After one month it leaks from the hot plate
"January 12, 2020",baselock,2.0,,Love the way this works but this is the 2nd one we purchased and they both leaked from the bottom. Started Leaking after the warranty was up.
"June 23, 2021",C. Maher,3.0,,"It does well as a coffeemaker, however having to use the internal tank, which holds the brewed coffee, for filling the water tank is awkward."
"March 7, 2021",Kathleen Clemons,1.0,,"very noisy, takes longer than last similar pot, and sloppy when filling cup, ya have to hold it just right or coffee goes around and behind cup...always a mess under pot every morning no matter how careful I am..."
"May 23, 2021",james fisher,5.0,,I like the coffee maker it's easy to use it's easy to clean in the coffee has good flavor I have had no problems with it although it's just been a little short time that I have had it
"January 5, 2019",Tim McCoy,5.0,,"This will be the third one of these we've had and by far the best coffee maker out their. Well, Bunn and the industrial types excluded."
"March 22, 2019",anonymous,5.0,,My older Hamilton Beach had a permanent filter and it also fits this one.  Love the keep warm timer.
"February 25, 2018",KL,1.0,,Frustrated that this coffee pot leaks if there is brewed coffee in the canister. Keeps coffee hot. Like the fact that there is no carafe. Makes grabbing a cup quick and easy. Wouldn’t recommend though bc always coffee on the counter.
"January 9, 2020",MAHF,2.0,,"We have owned 3 Hampton Beach Coffee makers with internal storage coffee pot, This new design is not good!  Hard to get coffee without spilling.  Pot leaks and is very poor quality"
"July 28, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This our third one. We like that there is no carafe to clean or break. And even though it keeps coffee warm when you set the timer. It does seem to get bitter like some
"May 9, 2015",K Roberts,5.0,2,Love it.  It keeps the coffee warm without the burnt flavor and it is nice a sleek in the kitchen.  The glass coffee pot had to be constantly soaked in bleach to get the coffee stains off.  I don't have to worry about the kids getting to close to it.
"May 22, 2020",Kori,1.0,,I got a new coffee pot because my last pot was old and started to leak. After using this one a few times I realized this pot leaked as well. I have coffee dripping down my cup and underneath the pot.
"February 6, 2019",Rebecca Martin,1.0,One,Leaks horrible
"January 17, 2021",Kristi Bowerman,3.0,,I am disappointed that the button for the strong brew does not work. I have to use more coffee just to make it strong. Not happy with that
"July 10, 2020",brainer,1.0,,the unit stopped working within 8 months of purchase.  Prior BrewStation lasted much longer.  We really liked this coffeemaker but will not be purchasing another one.
"February 22, 2021",JD,2.0,,The top leaks. Coffee all over every brew.
"November 14, 2020",Gustavo Rios,5.0,,"Buen producto, entrega rápida para Colombia, Gracias"
"May 10, 2021",Peggy Pelot,5.0,,This is our second unit.  It is nice to have coffee ready and not have a pot sitting on a burner cooking your coffee.  Neat and easy to use.
"July 1, 2018",larry miller,5.0,,had this for a year now ...i make a pot every day and it still making great coffee
"February 13, 2021",Roni,2.0,,This is very noisy when its done brewing. While keeping coffee warm it is annoying. Thinking about sending it back
"August 24, 2015",Cathy W.,5.0,,"I really like having the dispenser for my coffee. I can easily get a cup before it finishes brewing and it is easy to clean. I used to use a Keurig, but they just got too expensive. I wanted a stylish coffee maker for my coffee station and this one works great."
"February 19, 2016",Julie,5.0,,"Great product, easy to use, and keeps the coffee hot for up to 4 hours.  We were able to use the product without reading the direction because it's very straightforward. Highly recommended."
"February 16, 2019",gtenaj,1.0,,This is the second one I purchased. Both have leaked. The leak starts small but gradually gets worse and makes a huge mess. Not going to purchase another one. Do not recommend!!
"July 30, 2019",MICKI ZAKAS,5.0,,"This is a great coffee pot. We have 3-one for home, one for summer home, and one for our office. Very easy to use, has several brew options, and keeps hot for 4 hours!"
"January 7, 2018",alicia,5.0,,This is a great coffee maker! Loved the idea of having no carafe (after having several break). Easy to use and clean. Have been using every day for a few months and no issues.
"May 18, 2019",Ketti Nitz,1.0,,This is the 4th brew station we have bought thinking the manufacturing would be better. I will not buy another.The sucker leaks just like all the others. You cannot program because it draws the water right away. It leaks just like all the others did.I think we deserve to get one free.
"May 20, 2019",DDT,5.0,,"Our favorite coffee brewer, easy to use, clock to set and brew for ready in the morning java. Most importantly we get great tasting coffee."
"June 13, 2013",Brandon P,4.0,,"We previously had a hamilton beach brew station, just a older model.  A few things they changed with this design that took a little while to get used to but it seems to make coffee with no problems.  The heat plate doesn't seem to be as big as the previous model so it may seem that the coffee doesn't get really hot, but it gets hot enough to enjoy."
"January 21, 2019",Loveindo,4.0,,It works good keeps my coffee hot
"March 4, 2019",NikkiF,5.0,,We are in love with this coffee maker! Shipping was really slow.
"May 11, 2015",SJ,5.0,,have been using this for a while now... love not having to worry about a glass carafe.. just put your cup under and you have hot coffee.  Husband doesn't like change.. took him a while to decide he liked it... but he does.
"November 20, 2019",Jazen Blake,5.0,,Absolutely love this!! Keeps the coffee hot on a timer and is super easy to brew and empty. Ive had mine for a month and use it daily. Great product reasonable price!
"July 2, 2018",George Hayes,5.0,,Great machine.
"July 26, 2017",Lillian A. Bull,5.0,,I have had this a while now. Bought one for my sister in law. She really loved mine. So easy to use. We love the bold setting and how long you can have it to keep coffee hot. Just love it. Would highly recomend.
"February 17, 2016",Jennifer,5.0,,"Love it! I get the water and ground coffee ready the night before and set the time for it to start brewing. Love that you can also set it to stay warm for however long, select the brew strength, etc. Easy to use, easy to clean."
"March 4, 2020",A deb,5.0,,We’ve used it daily for a few months. It works well. Good flavor for a drip machine. It’s nice not having a glass carafe to deal with.
"June 22, 2020",Shelby,3.0,,Everything about this product is great EXCEPT I got one that leaks when you push the thing for the coffee to come out. Still works but it's definitely not ideal to have coffee leaking out every time I fill my cup :(
"January 3, 2020",Kkreated,5.0,,Purchased for Mother’s Christmas gift.  I was hesitant as she is elderly. Easy to use and brews well. Pleasantly surprised. Great product. Purchasing an additional one for my home.
"April 2, 2018",Manda3718,5.0,,I love that the pieces are all removable so that I can wash the water tank.
"June 30, 2016",Gail Piernas-Davenport,5.0,2,I've been using this for a few weeks now. This replaced a traditional Hamilton Beach coffee maker with a carafe and I have enjoyed not having to drink that stale second cup of coffee. You know what I mean!
"April 22, 2019",GinetteC,5.0,,Love the carafe free concept!! exactly what I wanted - not bulky on counter either. Overall a good purchase.
"March 13, 2018",JD Fernandez,5.0,,Good product! Good price!
"January 8, 2014",Mark C. Redenius,1.0,,Bought this Oct. 2013 past coffee makers from Hamilton Beach we had for years before needing a new one always happy with them. This model for one makes all kinds of gurgling noise  keeping the coffee warm and started to leak not at the fill tank but underneath where you put the grounds within 2 months had to use a paper towel to soak up the water usual two paper towels so it was a lot of water.  We just purchased the same model we had before this one which lasted 3 years.  So I would pass on this model.  Tried to ignore other reviews warnings but oh well they were correct in their low rating.
"October 19, 2018",AK,1.0,One,Timer does not work!
"April 14, 2018",Angel lady,5.0,,Easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee.
"January 2, 2016",koikaze,3.0,,"I makes really good coffee, but it brews at 165 F at best.  Just after brewing I can take a really big sip without burning.  If you use cold creamer you can just forget about this coffee maker if normal hot coffee is important to you.  I use Peet's Coffee Dickensons, freshly grind, and its really close to the stuff I get at store, so I'll keep it.  Another thing to consider is if you use a cold mug in the morning and fill it with coffee, you're really looking at about 150 F."
"January 29, 2021",Barbara Harper,2.0,,"I dislike that half my coffee did not go into my cup it, it leaked down the side of my cup. The coffee holder does not fit like it should on the base."
"May 9, 2017",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I have worn out 4 of these Hamilton beach coffee makers I got this kind years ago because my husband couldn't pour coffee from coffee pot without making a mess. I don't like this updated coffee maker, Apparently they decide to fix something that wasn't broke. The previous model's water reservoir was in back and was much easier to pout water in The new version water reservoir is low and on the side of the coffee maker and harder to fill without pouring water all over the counter."
"October 9, 2014",Rescue dog lady,5.0,,"Very happy with this product. It was a little different than my old coffee pot, however, the coffee taste is so much better than the old drip pot. I just love it. I do use a measuring cup to fill the water well instead of the one on the coffee pot, it is easier to fill that way for me."
"June 14, 2020",jena white,2.0,,It was ok at first. My husband said the coffee kinda tasted like dirty dishwater. I started to taste it more as time went. Now after the return date is past it’s started to leak. I’m very unhappy with my purchase
"August 31, 2016",Alameda Pete,1.0,One,Purchased mid-March and by mid August it stopped turning on. Have contacted Hamilton Beach Customer service regarding replacement. Will update with a more positive review if we get a reasonable reply.  Messing with people's coffee addiction should be a punishable crime.
"November 2, 2019",Jason,5.0,,I freaking love this coffee maker. 10/10 would buy again.
"February 18, 2021",xmas shopper,1.0,,This coffee maker is junk. Leaks every time you pour a cup of coffee. Had an older model that worked perfectly. Won't consider buying again.
"July 14, 2019",D. Amsler,5.0,,"This is my 3rd brew station and I love it....would not have any other brand...makes great coffee, automatic start and shut off, easy to clean and looks nice!"
"January 21, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I would buy this coffee pot again!  The ability to not use a carafe frees me from dealing with another thing to wash and the possibility of it breaking.  It keeps the coffee hot for 4 hours and can be set to start brewing right before you get up.  I love how I can get a cup of coffee before the brew cycle is complete.  If you want a great coffee maker this is it.
"February 24, 2019",Nanner,5.0,,My favorite coffee maker. Easy to use and clean and make coffee
"February 9, 2021",karen kiley,2.0,,I was so disappointed in the quality and the handle that you press is so awkward. Not very study either.
"September 6, 2018",henry jeffries,5.0,,easy to use and like the beep when ready
"July 29, 2018",Deborah Clark,5.0,,Had this brand before and loved it.
"May 1, 2018",REP,5.0,,Great coffee.  Reminds me to when to clean it.  Coffee always hot.  Easy to clean.  Our best pot!
"June 21, 2013",SunnyinFlorida,5.0,,"We love this coffee maker!  I don't understand the negative reviews on this?  The price was great, half of what our old coffee maker cost.  Smaller footprint, doesn't leak, tall cups fit under it and we can see what is going in the cup.  We prefer tank style with no carafe and this is perfect."
"August 12, 2015",SherryQ,5.0,,"Out of everything that I purchased for my new home, this is my favorite. Easy to fill, easy to empty, and keeps the coffee at a very pleasant tip. The only improvement that I would make, would be a viewer or other type of gage to see how much coffee is left."
"January 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Miss the light and handle to pour coffee. The cup holder could be deeper. But very good value for the price. Saved about $150.00 over replace it with my old brand.
"April 9, 2014",C. Dennis,4.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this machine works and what a good cup of coffee it brews!  I use a grind and brew at home - purchased this one for my travel trailer so I can quickly brew and be on my way with my travel mug full!  It is light weight, easy to use and VERY easy to clean!"
"January 21, 2020",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Love this machine! Keeps coffee hot and works great. The only fault I have found so far is the picture on the power button has warn off quickly.
"June 16, 2014",Corporate14,4.0,,"Love the fact coffee makers don't have pots anymore. The pots always break or pour coffee on the floor as well as your cup. Serve yourself design is much more efficient and keeps you from burning yourself on hot glass. Sleek and space age looking, this coffee maker is nice looking in the kitchen too."
"May 23, 2014",The Yarn Bag,4.0,,"I contemplated on buying the Keurig, but decided there wasn't anough taste difference to justify paying over $100 for a coffeemaker. Bought this and it makes a good cup of coffee. The bold setting saves on the amount of coffee required to make two cups.  The coffee stays hot and it doesn't taste burnt. No mess. I'm satisfieid."
"January 3, 2020",Nancy Metcalfe,2.0,,Already broke the first one was same why never again...
"August 15, 2014",Kindle Customer,3.0,,"I like this coffee brewer, but the coffee well leaks down to the interior and condensation from the lid also leaks below the coffee well. Could be better constructed for the price. I've taken to immediately removing the coffee well as soon as I've finished drinking my coffee, which prevents the issue, but I shouldn't have to."
"January 3, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,The only issue with this coffee maker is you can not restart to keep coffee warm after it turns off after the 4 hour you set it for. It tells you to poor in water.
"July 18, 2018",Janet M.,5.0,,Love this coffee maker! The programmer and the option of how long to keep it warm are so chic and very useful! I love being able to push my cup in and get a refill.
"November 2, 2015",Christopher Smith,4.0,,So far so good.. It it is a little harder and messy pouring the water into the tank The older model had separate reservoir which only had to put the water in.. This model have to put water in the reservoir then pour into the tank. Does make good coffee.
"December 1, 2015",Sandra J. Kitchen,1.0,2,"Returned this item, didn't keep coffee warm enough, awkward to work with, too tall for under the cabinet use!"
"May 12, 2012",William Paton,5.0,,"Excellent product. We have never had a drop of spillage when dispensing the coffee as others have reported. Possibly, Hamilton Beach has changed the products design slightly. The 1 to 4 hour stay warm feature is great. We had been looking for a coffee maker with an insulated carafe until we came across this product. We find no faults with our purchase and give it a solid 5 stars."
"September 2, 2019",Judy Banks,5.0,,I have used the Brew Station for years.  I love that it is self contained with no glass carafe to stain!  The styles have changed a bit throughout the years but the concept is the same. Excellent product!
"June 8, 2019",Tyler George,5.0,,Love this coffee maker! I was super skeptical about buying it due to the bad reviews but I love it and I'm so glad I did!
"November 3, 2019",Delly,5.0,,We have used this type of coffee maker for years and by far this is the best one yet!
"August 17, 2016",mayac53,4.0,,its not the best brew i've ever had (i like dark and full-bodied) but its decent for home coffee maker. love that i can program it so my coffee is nice and hot when i wake up. and it does get hot!
"March 8, 2020",Giuseppe Saladino,5.0,,"Amazing product, Flavour the coffee always is the same"
"October 12, 2016",HadaboJi,5.0,One,This is the second HB Coffee maker. Although some minor differences between models this took a little adjustment. With the HB coffee makers received numerous favorable comments on taste.
"January 30, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I bought this newer model to replace an older one I have, which I love. I like having my iced coffees. First thing I noticed was the plastic used for this product is lightweight and flimsy. Second, the top chamber didn't sit flat on the base which made it rock back and forth. Third, after a week the digital clock stopped working. Wasn't happy at all, so I returned it for my money back. Hopefully my older model lasts another 5 years. Newer isn't always better."
"January 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,this the third one of the same product  gets alot of use.
"January 22, 2019",heavy 5819,5.0,,great product
"September 8, 2018",SCB,5.0,,Love it so much we bought this as a replacement to the exact same one after four years of heavy use. Excellent brew. Easy to clean.
"December 6, 2017",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"My Dad, age 88 loves this coffee pot and this is the second one we have bought. The first one lasted a little over a year and started leaking. I searched and found the exact coffee pot and purchased in June of this year, 2017. He was relieved that he wouldn't have to learn a new coffee pot. It has already started leaking enough water to pour off the counter and into the floor.So, this pot lasted less than 6 months."
"June 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,It leaked underneath
"May 24, 2019",Patricia A. Lane,5.0,,I love this coffeemaker. It’s easy to use. I have had this before. The coffee doesn’t get bitter and I don’t have to worry about a carafe. I had the one with the water tank on side and did not like it. It wasn’t sturdy enough.
"June 1, 2016",Olivia Garrett,5.0,,I LOVE this coffee maker! It is so easy to use and my coffee comes out perfect every time!! Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice coffee machine but don't want to spend a crap ton of money
"February 23, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,It works at first then breaks down then you have to play hell getting your money back
"January 22, 2016",l t page,4.0,,We really like this coffee maker.  It makes good coffee and keeps it hot. The inside of the coffee reservoir has many obstacles which makes it hard to clean.  Best part is no more coffee stains on the counter
"February 26, 2018",Angel Healing With Mary,4.0,,"I love how fast it works, being able to put my coffee cup up to it and fill the cup without needing to pour coffee. While it keeps the coffee warm I can hear it bubbling. It is not loud but if you have the coffee maker close to you it might bother you. Great coffee and easy to use. This is the older model and I have heard the new model does not make the sounds while staying warm."
"March 30, 2021",Mark Bohn,5.0,,"Convenient not having to use a craft to pour coffee, the use of the same container for coffee and fresh water seems to me that it will not always to get it clean enough.  Other than that is is a nice unit."
"March 18, 2019",jeremiah moulton,5.0,,all features work great. worth the money
"September 12, 2019",redcupgal,1.0,,I opened this up yesterday and threw out the box.  I normally love this coffee maker as we had one. I made coffee this morning and it was all over my counter. The container that holds the coffee was cracked.
"January 1, 2014",Artur Grabowski,5.0,,This coffeemaker is great. I use it daily with the timed brew feature. It takes about 3 minutes for me to clean and reset the unit. When you lift the lid above the filter some condensation will flow down the back of the coffeemaker but it is not significant and it is clean water.
"June 9, 2013",C. J. Yuke,5.0,,I bought this coffee maker because it is a newer version of the same coffee maker that I presently own but is getting old. I stayed with the same brand because Hamilton Beach is a dependable name brand and the coffee maker has been very dependable.  Great for making 1 to 12 cups of coffee.
"January 30, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I like the easy dispensing and like that it makes a full pot without having a carafe. I have owned one before and loved it so bought another!
"November 16, 2014",Renee Miller,3.0,One,"I like this product enough to just dry the inside of the machine after each brew (water collects underneath both the machine itself and inside the machine, a design flaw that Hamilton Beach is aware of, from what I've read in other reviews.)  This would easily be a five star product were it not for that one hassle.  I utilize the time of taking it apart to dry it to do a general wipe down of the entire pot, so perhaps the silver lining is that we have the cleanest coffee pot ever."
"July 13, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Cost effective.  Works well
"February 18, 2016",Autumn C.,5.0,,"LOVE this coffee maker!! it really tastes great and clean! I love all the settings AND THE PRICE!!! My sister is ordering one too after having coffee over at my house. I am a Mother of two young kids, I need all the coffee I can get, this is the way I want my coffee :)"
"December 21, 2018",joechef1,5.0,,"Got this as a gift and she loves it. Easy to use, fill and make coffee."
"August 28, 2015",elie kim,5.0,,"I have bought it about a year ago and I am still using it without any problem. It is very cute and sturdy. The metal-looking part is not metal, but is  plastic, but it's still quite strong and well built. I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone. Also, it keeps the coffee warm and fresh for 4 hours."
"May 20, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,This is the 2nd brewstation we bought because we like the carafe-less feature.  However after a short while both started to leak from under the maker.  It appears the seals break under the coffee holder. Will not buy again.
"May 18, 2013",Peg,1.0,,"First, the coffee is not hot enough when it comes through.  If you leave it for about 10 minutes it will be OK. I cleaned it today, following instructions carefully.  What a complication that was!  After I carried out the directions according to the description in the book (which took about 45 minutes!) I noticed my counter was covered with vinegar! It leaked, which meant the coffee release mechanism failed.  After only having had this machine a short time, having this happen was a disappointment to say the least.  The brewer is still under warranty but the consumer must pay the postage to and from Hamilton Beach which will cost more than buying a new one.No, it will not be a Hamilton Beach!  Off to e-waste it goes.  Back to an ordinary coffee pot for me!  Caveat emptor!"
"August 14, 2019",Adriena,5.0,,This is the best coffeemaker I have ever had. I love how it keeps the coffee hot for a number of hours and the taste is still fresh as the first cup.
"August 27, 2016",JFW,5.0,,"Had one of these for years. It died and we figured we would try something different. Well that was a mistake.. That coffee maker is on its way to Goodwill and has been replaced with the Hamilton Beach Brewstation. It makes good plain old coffee, lots of it and keeps it hot for four hours. What the heck else can you ask from a coffee maker."
"September 21, 2016",Shawna,5.0,,"I've been using this for about 3 weeks now. So far I love it. My only critique would be that I wish it had some kind of light to help see how full your cup is getting, but part of that problem could just be the lighting in my kitchen. Otherwise it works well."
"September 26, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,PERFECT COFFEE MAKER FOR ME !! I can brew exactly how much I like.... NO PITCHER TO BREAK
"May 19, 2016",Cliff,5.0,,So far so good. I like the unit allot. The first thing I noticed is how much quieter it brews. No more foofing and gurgling noises. Easy to clean as well. I have no issue with this item and would buy it again.
"February 23, 2021",Michelle Nicely,1.0,,Terrible quality! Replaced it once in two months and the second one leaked all over the place immediately!
"June 26, 2020",charles Michlik,2.0,,The bar to push for coffee sticks sometimes.  Have to push harder.
"June 17, 2018",Karen C. Ray,4.0,,Makes great coffee! Easy to use!
"July 10, 2019",Anne W Faulkner,4.0,,Coffee dispenser
"March 19, 2021",JJ & BJ,1.0,,Very noisy even after its finished brewing
"April 12, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I love my new coffeemaker, is so easy to clean, and the coffee ir really hot. 👍🏼"
"December 6, 2016",Skeeta,3.0,,"I like the overall operation and especially the ""no carafe"" concept. However, when i take the brew basket our to dump and refill, it drips quite a bit."
"January 25, 2021",Melissa R,1.0,,This is how my coffee maker arrived. Not off to a great start. Sending this back. I don’t trust that it will work properly after being through what this obviously has!
"December 25, 2016",Margaret Roth,4.0,One,"I don't understand the negative reviews. It's reasonably priced, easy to set up, program, fill, and clean the tank. I prefer tank style coffee makers, no glass carafe,and no burnt coffee taste even after a few hours, It's great to have my coffee ready at 4:30 am again! I used the permanent filter from another brand of coffee maker, and it works fine.When you flip the lid up after brewing, there is some condensation that runs down the back. Easy fix, put a towel at the base or hold a paper towel there and wipe any excess water off. I only gave it 4 stars strictly for design flaws. The handle on the coffee tank is not centered, so when you lift, it tilts. The bar to dispense coffee is set too high for normal cups. The base is not weighted enough, so if you don't have something behind it, put a hand behind it so it doesn't move. The drip tray is really not wide enough to put a coffee cup on safely, so if you have to answer the phone or the door, or chase after kids or pets, put your cup on the counter."
"March 27, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Great for the office.  Nice to not have to deal with glass pots. Love the re-warm option that keeps coffee hot and tasting good all day without the burned flavor.

"March 23, 2019",seth bracken,1.0,,"After about 6 months of casual use and regular cleaning, my coffee maker just stopped working. It simply won’t turn on. I’ve tried everything. Such a disappointment. Don’t buy this model."
"November 27, 2015",skpylee,3.0,,Took me a while to get used to this coffee maker. I think the coffee could be hotter coming out. It's kind of messy pouring the water into the reservoir. Once I got used to the amout of coffee to use with the maker it was okay. I feel it works best with freshly ground coffee.
"January 17, 2018",biking lady,4.0,,"This is our third coffee pot of this style. The ease of one cup at a time as needed is very nice, keeps coffee at perfect temperature up to 4 hours. Very easy to program, fill and clean."

"April 5, 2014",Robert Crowley,5.0,One,I love this coffee pot i have always had a coffee pot in my home and i have always a carafe it would end up braking or getting burnt coffee stuck to the bottom. however with this no more carafe just brew and serve and the fact that it makes iced coffee as well is an added bonus.
"June 29, 2019",Estella O'Dell,5.0,,This is my 2nd one the 1st lasted 3 years easy to fill with filtered water from refrigerator.
"July 18, 2017",SUSAN THEISEN,4.0,,"The Hamilton Beach coffee maker eliminates lifting the carafe and pouring water, which is a problem for not so tall people.  It's the reason we purchased it after using it at a friends house. Makes great coffee."
"January 3, 2013",K. Abbey,5.0,,"We'd had a Hamilton Beach brewstation for years and it finally died.  Based on the price, I assumed we'd get something similar.  This one far surpasses our old one, with additional features such as brew strength, hours to keep coffee warm, handle on filter basket, and overall better construction.  I can't see any reason to buy a more expensive pot -- this one is great."
"August 4, 2014",gina m snyder,1.0,One,"I had my previous Hamilton Beach coffeemaker for a lot of years. It stopped working late May & we purchased this one June 4th. The top piece on the water reservoir  broke within 5 days. It took about 10 days before we realized that it would leak everyday. There would be quite a bit of water on the counter surrounding coffeemaker. I would dry it with 3-4 paper towels daily but it was annoying. I wanted to return it but Amazon only gives you a month. If I had purchased it @  Kohls , Macys, JC Penney, etc. I could return it. Guess this will be my last purchase from Amazon. I am throwing coffeemaker in garbage which kinda makes me mad because I wasted $40."
"May 8, 2019",Lisa Caudill,1.0,,"Brought my brand new coffee maker to work, set it up to automatically brew a pot so it would be ready for me this morning only to discover that half the water had leaked out of the reservoir overnight."

"November 16, 2016",LLL,1.0,One,"I was so excited to get this Brew Station only to be let down every where I looked. There are so many design flaws and serious hazards with this unit. First the lid and reservoir fit poorly together witch gives a place for steam to exit. Secondly, when you open the lid it often spits out hot water directly forward and up toward your face! Third, water pools all over the place. Under the filter basket, under the reservoir, and down the back. The screen is too bright at night and not very readable in the day. If you look at it from different heights it becomes completely blank at 4 feet. But my biggest complaint is the round, narrow back. The whole coffee maker constantly spins when you try to get a cup of Joe. To top it all off this thing sticks out from the wall like a soar thumb, I can't even see any other appliance on the counter till I get half way into the room. Also people have asked about the difference between this one and the one $5 less... it's the stainless plate on the front. That's it."
"June 21, 2019",Aimee,2.0,,"I loved this Coffee Pot at first, however after about 6 months is started to leak....A LOT.  I followed the instructions provided for cleaning and troubleshooting the issue, however nothing worked.  I ended up throwing it out and buying a traditional coffee maker."
"January 2, 2021",jimbo henderson,1.0,,it leaked from the get go returned it
"December 12, 2015",Christa Lange,1.0,One,We have this about 6 weeks and it no longer makes all the coffee.  You have to keep turning it on and off to get to make the whole pot.  And it needs to sit in the warmer about a half hour to get hot.  of course it is to late to return to Amazon so in the garbage it goes.  Oh well.  Thats what I get for going cheap.
"March 24, 2017",Sllongley28,5.0,,"So far so good, no leaking like others stated and it's been at least a couple of weeks, so will update if it does. Love being able to get one cup at a time without having to use a pot!"

"November 9, 2013",D. Newman,1.0,3,"The third time it was used, the spout began to leak and dumped the entire contents of the coffeemaker on the counter and floor. The first time it was used, the liquid was hot and just right. The third time, only lukewarm. I would NOT recommend this model, however, Hamilton Beach does make some good products.  Failure of design on this one though."
"April 12, 2016",tabatha,5.0,,"Loving it so far, the only weird thing that worries me is the time LED area after coffee has been in internal pot for about hour is distorted and almost to hot, I am worried it will go out sooner than later... But otherwise awesome"

"July 31, 2016",joshua macleod,4.0,2,"So far I love this coffee maker. It brew just as fast as anyone that I have had In the past. The beep it makes when it's done is quiet.(which I like, so my child doesn't wake). It's a little hard to get used to not coffee pot. But so far I love what I purchased!"
"September 25, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I ordered item a month ago but have only used it for 3 weeks. The push part you use to fill your cup broke already. Don’t waste your money on this product, cheaply made."

"November 5, 2016",It’s Me Again,5.0,2,"Excellent coffee maker. I love that it has a programmable feature, although I haven't used it yet. Along with that programmable start time you can also set it to keep your coffee nice and hot for up to 4 hours after it's finished its cycle. Coffee tastes wonderful and it's a breeze to make, I love that there's not a carafe in it so that way I have one less thing to accidentally break. My only complaint is that I can't fit my 30oz tumbler under the spout and have it stand up. I have to lean it at an angle to get it to work and if I want to fill the entire thing up I have to get a bowl or another cup to be able to pour into my EcoReduce/RTIC/Yeti tumblers. I'd give it a four and a half stars if I could, but since it's such a slight inconvenience I'll give it five stars as I don't want to down-rank it to four."
"July 25, 2016",howard mcallister,3.0,2,Instructions space and need a lot of reading between the lines to use the coffee maker. Setting start brew instructions especially sketchy. Time to avoid these more sophisticated devices.
"June 27, 2021",Carol Cox,4.0,,Great coffee station!
"August 26, 2017",Mike Grier,4.0,2,"We really, really like this coffee machine. Almost love but we will see. We purchased a used fifth wheel travel trailer and wanted a coffee machine for it. I prefer thermal carafe machines because the one pot we make in the morning tends to last us into the early afternoon which works great for us. My preferred Melitta machine was unavailable so I was looking at bottom priced brewers and decided to give it a try. The removable water reservoir is great. The internal coffee carafe is genius. So easy to dump any remnants and the dispenser has been reliable this whole summer. My only complaint is that since it has no thermal insulation, the coffee maker has a warming pad (burnt coffee bad!) and once the time is up, the coffee goes cold quickly. The warmer does not seem to really burn the coffee badly but I'm used to coffee that just stays warm and fresh for 4-6 hours after brewing. Still, love the convenience. At this price point this is clearly the machine I would go to."
"March 3, 2019",Jamie S,5.0,,Although I probably over paid by about $12(for some reason it was less money after I ordered) it is worth. So far seems quite durable and I love that it stays warm for up to 4 hrs. Great coffee maker!
"October 6, 2019",Lisa G. Bissette,1.0,,Had it less than a month and it doesn’t work properly. Unfortunately I didn’t check return status as I thought it was too late. It wasn’t but is now. Wouldn’t recommend but you get what you pay for.

"August 30, 2019",christy mayhew,2.0,,The dispensing lever/button was loose causing it to be pushed inside the machine upon use.  Returned.
"October 20, 2013",Joann W. Langley,5.0,2,I love my coffee maker.  In other tips I saw where some did not like the way the coffee came out.  Said it was too far back.  Mine never has spilled and there is a little dip with a grate at the bottom in case it should.  I would encourage anyone who asked to feel free to buy it with confidence.
"May 7, 2018",David,4.0,,"Works great but it drips when you pull the pot to clean it.  Nothing wrong with the pot, just the overall design.  It’s makes good coffee however."
"May 30, 2017",Shaun L.,5.0,,"Bought this coffee maker for my trailer and it's a perfect fit. Works great, too. Great for one cup at a time. Hamilton Beach is a good brand, thank you!"

"May 9, 2019",Rick Kepler,5.0,,Great purchase
"June 22, 2017",Tommy T,1.0,,Re-Furbished - equipment lasted about 6 brews and just stopped working.  Lights went out so it would appear they placed a band-aid on this pot that would eventually tear off and this one lasted 6 weeks.
"November 24, 2018",Erie patterson,2.0,,I've had this coffee maker for 4 months and I want to return it but its too late now. The coffee never gets hot enough and it isn't getting the last 2 cups of water to run through. I can't ever seem to get a decent cup of coffee.

"September 20, 2017",L.M.,5.0,,"Broke so many glass carafes in our household (dishwashing kids are careless) and since I don't care for keurigs, I bought this as a replacement.  Great buy!"
"March 22, 2014",Bull Moose,4.0,,Makes great coffee with normal filters.  Brewing just hot enough by design to keep longer.  Unconventional to set up.  Empty and set up by kitchen sink.  Use smaller mugs so you don't have to drink the coffee so fast.  If you use a big mug and get distracted you will be microwaving.
"July 30, 2016",Nicole A.,3.0,4,I was expecting this to be a very compact and easy to use coffee maker. Unfortunately it's much bulkier and harder to use then expected. The water tank and coffee grounds holder all come out which I expected to be a nice aspect but it's very messy. Every time I use it water or old coffee spills because the pieces are (of course) quite wet. I also end up spilling while pouring water into the tank because there is a center piece that water easily splashes off of. (Pictured). It makes very good coffee but if I had purchased this at target I probably would have returned it. Overall I would recommend Hamilton Beach products but not this coffee maker.
"November 20, 2019",Angel,4.0,,"I really like this coffee maker and would give it a full 5 star rating, however after using it for awhile it's suddenly not completely brewing all the water through..."
"April 29, 2016",Susan Feigenbaum,5.0,,"Honestly, this was one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. Great coffee, no burnt taste, and doesn't go stale as quickly. Also nice to have it waiting for me in the morning."

"April 27, 2020",heather hathaway,2.0,,I just purchased this and have used maybe 3 times and coffee leaks out when you press your cup against the bar.  I have 2 of these previously and never had an issue.  this one however may go back.  very frustrating.
"June 30, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Have had the coffee maker for a few months. It worked great initially. Now, it won’t stop beeping when trying to brew, and will not brew. Sometimes it takes three attempts of new coffee grounds to get it to brew. Unsatisfied due to this reason."
"June 19, 2011",Sandman Telecom,1.0,,"UPDATE: This one didn't last long. Started leaking. I cleaned the inside and valve thing with Lime Away, which stopped the leak. The Lime Away also marred the fake Stainless Steel on the front (it's very fake, since a magnet sticks to all the stainless steel on the thing). Then the thing wouldn't stop trying to boil the water. It constantly sounded like it was frying. If I didn't throw it away, I'm sure it would have burned the house down. Since I didn't use it to make coffee, just hot water, this is what I ended up replacing it with - which is absolutely GREAT (so far), has 4 temperature settings, and holds 4 liters of hot water (it will stay on all the time if the water lasts you a few days, or you can set it to turn off after a while):   I bought this cleaner, which is citric acid, but haven't used it or needed it yet:   -------------------------------------------- This is the third Brew Station I've bought. This model is an improvement to what looks like the same model I bought last time. The main improvement is that the part you press the cup against doesn't stick out as much, so the liquid doesn't spill with nearly every cup poured. Another improvement is that the stainless trim doesn't stain immediately. The reason I've bought three of these so far is that the previous two just plain leaked. Fill it up, press start, come back 10 minutes later and the hot water or coffee is all over the floor. In my case, it actually ruined the kitchen cabinets by having the whole 6 cups of hot water running down the wood. I've never made coffee with the machine, I just use it to heat water and dispense it into a cup. The solution after I ruined the cabinets was to move the whole coffee maker up so it's hanging over the edge of the counter by an inch. That way the water simply drips onto the floor. It worked, because I've found it all on the floor at least a few times since that first experience. Hasn't ruined the hardwood floor, yet. Why have I bought a third one? Because in reading the reviews of the more expensive brands out there that don't need a pot, they seem to break all the time. This thing is cheaper, so I can buy two for the cost of one of the others. Not surprising since the Hamilton Beach as well as all the other brands are designed in a third world country where the engineers probably ride a donkey to work, probably don't have electricity in their homes, probably don't have a bathroom in their homes, and may have never heard of coffee. Maybe they improved the thing so it won't leak from the dispenser on this model? It hasn't leaked yet, but I've only had it a couple of months. I used CLR every month or so with the previous models to remove any calcium buildup from the dispensing valve (a spring and a rubber O ring). The part I just can't get over is having to look at this thing every morning when it goes down two cups when I fill my 9 ounce plastic cup. So I'm thinking every morning ""Do I really drink 6 cups of instant coffee every morning?"" I looked up on the Internet that a cup is 8 ounces. Then I looked on the Hamilton Beach website where it says their machines use 4.5 ounces for a cup. So every morning I'm reminded that I gave money to a company who purposely deceived me by labeling a 6 cup coffeemaker as 12 cups. Are any of the other manufacturers more honest than Hamilton Beach? I don't know, but I do know I'm going to look when this thing breaks. I just don't like having their lie shoved in my face EVERY morning (which is why I'm writing this review)."

"February 7, 2015",William H. Hamilton,5.0,,Nice product. We program for coffee ready in AM when we get up .Great way to start the day. Easy to use a hands free dispenser. Follow recommended cleaning recommendations and it will last a few years with hard water conditions or use filtered water..
"November 7, 2018",hevenly,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. No pot that get all stained or broken.
"October 8, 2019",Helen Grace Chavez,4.0,,"Loved my new Hamilton coffee brewer,  it’s not messy when I get my coffee. I wish the coffee stays hotter after it brewed. As an additional feature wish there is timer sound after stops brewing."
"February 25, 2019",CYNTHIA rusakovich,5.0,,I just love this coffee maker
"July 21, 2016",Ben P.,5.0,,This product was better than I ever expected. It does a wonderful job brewing the coffee and then keeping it warm for the time selected. I really like the fact that it doesn't have a carafe to keep clean and have to deal with. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good coffee maker.
"July 15, 2013",JD,5.0,,"I purchased this because I was fed up with every single other coffee maker I have ever owned due to the carafe dripping when I poured the coffee. This has been the perfect solution! Clean, easy, and the coffee stays warm for a long time. I love this. Another bonus is the iced coffee feature, very easy to use and quite tasty. Been using it for two months and I can't think of a bad thing to say about it."
"September 4, 2018",Judy McClarren,5.0,,Works just fine
"January 11, 2016",Ellie,5.0,,"My wife and I love this coffee maker. Its easy to clean, it makes more coffee than we can drink without driving each other crazy and the coffee stays warm for a while. Need I mention it doesn't have a glass carafe for my kids to break? 1/3 of the price of a single cup maker that is all the rage these days."
"September 22, 2019",Rae J.,5.0,,This coffee pot is perfect for us. I love that I can make ten cups and can still only poor one cup at a time
"January 8, 2020",nancy,4.0,,I bought this for my mom for Christmas. I like that it can be taken part easily to wash un like others and that i can fill up a cup at a time. No need for a glass pot NO more 😊
"January 7, 2020",Colorado Consumer,5.0,,This has been my coffee maker of preference for years.
"June 24, 2020",Dea K.,1.0,,"When filling the pot, the water leaked all over the counter. Also, when you put your cup up to the pot to get coffee it leaked more."
"October 28, 2019",Deborah,1.0,,This has been leaking since I got it! I thought it was me not attaching the tank properly but it’s not.  And now it’s stopped brewing half way thru! I had the other model of this for years with no problem. How do I get this replaced !! Help
"November 17, 2013",vmm312,5.0,,"This has been my favorite coffee maker. I can make the coffee as strong as I like it, with the bold setting. It keeps the coffee fresher by not having a carafe, and its very easy to program. Cleanup is easy as well, every other month I use white vinegar to clean it thoroughly, but in between just a good wash is enough."
"December 11, 2020",Deswood Family,3.0,,"After 3 months and 3 days my coffee maker no longer works. It made good coffee, unfortunately it stop working... It just stop brewing."
"June 28, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,After only having it 4 months it broke. It turns on when you pour the water in and it’s not even on. Can’t program it because it starts brewing
"July 2, 2019",Pablo Urbina,2.0,,"This is a great idea, but it is not well built. The tank is not snug, its loose."
"May 12, 2021",Betty Fields,5.0,,Love it
"August 13, 2016","Jacksonville, FL",2.0,,"I returned the first because it did not brew hot coffee as stated. I just received a replacement and unfortunately it still brewed warn coffee not hot coffee. Also, the metal plate that keeps brewed coffee warm get corroded just after one brew. I am truly disappointed  because I decided to buy this model following a wonderful experience I had using the model 48464 at a hotel I recently stayed in."
"February 6, 2015",Denise Shepherd,1.0,One,"The first one we received literally simmered the coffee in the caraf while keeping it hot. You can hear it simmering. It tasted burned after a while. We returned it and the second one did the same thing. We just kept it and turned it off after it brewed to keep it from tasting burned and heated it up in the microwave. Now after 3 months, it is leaking all over the place when it brews and looses about a half a cup of water every time. Too late to return it now. We are switching to a different brand, although we liked the dispensing feature and the water reservoir placement of this coffeemaker."
"August 8, 2019",Kristina Wilkerson,1.0,,Already broken after less than 6 months of use and product support already closed?  I’m really unhappy.  Don’t buy this coffee maker!
"July 24, 2020",Susan Earnest,1.0,,"When trying to dispense the coffee, coffee would start leaking around the dispenser"
"March 8, 2020",sunway surfers,4.0,,I really like this product but I can definitely tell this one won’t last as long as my last one did. Quality doesn’t feel the same. But I guess that’s all appliances now. Nothing is made to last anymore.

"December 19, 2019",charlie,4.0,,If it had a led light so you could see. That would be great. Not a bad coffee maker though
"October 5, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,,This stopped working less than 10 months after we bought it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
"December 21, 2020",Sara Holwell,2.0,,"The button that you press to disperse coffee leaks all around the button, so there is always coffee everywhere."

"May 11, 2019",Porsche,5.0,One,Coffee
"May 11, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I think this coffee maker is a lot easier to use than traditional coffee makers that have actual pots.  Getting the coffee ready the night before is a breeze. I would highly recommend this product.
"February 12, 2021",Karen Zeisler,1.0,,This coffee maker makes an absolute mess underneath. I’ve owned several of this brand and prefer internal storage types. This was a disaster! Returned!
"April 8, 2018",karen,2.0,,"I ordered this is November and it is April and the coffee machine no longer works. As soon as the cleaning light came on, I put in the vinegar, just as directions stipulate, it would not turn on at all. This was disappointing, since I like the convenience of retrieving the coffee."
"July 12, 2013",Patricia H. Barker,5.0,,We were replacing practically the same coffee maker like we had been using for several years where the stream had gotten too thin and sometimes the maker leaked on the counter.  With Amazon Prime we received our purchase almost instantly and it has been giving us good coffee all week.
"January 27, 2020",WestEsq,5.0,,Great concept!  Love that there is no glass pot to clean and/or break.
"October 11, 2018",Steven Claypole,1.0,,This coffee maker started overheating 3 months after buying from Amazon.  After speaking with the manufacturer they will not replace or fix because it used at an office.  I was informed this VOIDS the warranty.  Thankfully Amazon Support did give me a full refund.  I will no longer be buying Hamilton Beach products.  Lesson learned...

"September 21, 2018",Liam,1.0,,"It leaks, what more do I have to say - Save your money on this one and Model 47900 12 cup maker. Oh, did I say it leaks all over the place, staining my counter top. - Program made me rate 1 star, I say no stars from me."
"March 26, 2019",hallieadams,1.0,,I like that there is no glass pot. Does it really matter when it is dripping and falling apart.
"March 24, 2017",Chewie,5.0,,Has lasted well over a year without any issues.  Holds a lot of coffee and keeps it hot for hours!
"April 21, 2014",Sharonna,4.0,,"No pot to mess with, no drips to wipe up.  The side load water fill tank is a nice improvement over rear load. The only small flaw is that if there is a few cups in the coffee despense tanks, and you go to make a full ""pot"", it can over flow.  Still it only takes one time to learn to check that!"
"January 9, 2019",Vahid Ebrahimi,1.0,One,Just broke down after a month an half. Very bad prodect
"October 8, 2019",Roberto Madrigal,5.0,,"Super convenient, easy to use and clean."
"December 30, 2018",Deena,1.0,,This was used a few times and it never made good coffee.  I bought a water pitcher with filter even thou I have well water and filtration system and that didn't help.  Also changed brands of coffee and still not good.  I wish I had asked to return it as I feel I just wasted my $50.00 there for would not recommend purchasing.
"September 10, 2016",Kat,5.0,,Used this coffee maker on an Airbnb vacation and loved it! So easy to use and very straightforward. I have used it every morning since I bought it and am in love! Little hint: make sure to press the Bold button if you'd like your coffee a little stronger. Helps so it's less watered down.
"April 30, 2020",sydnie,1.0,,it lasted 4 months then the coffee exploded and the machine shorted out shortly after and because of how long it was from when i bought it i cant get a refund. buy a different machine.

"December 5, 2020",Karen Thiele,2.0,,Disliked the dripping on the dispenser. Had 2 others prior to this purchase & never had a problem until i started using this one. Did not return  because  I got rid of the box it came in. TOTALLY DISSATISFIED!!!
"June 20, 2021",Robert Goldsmith Sr.,5.0,,Great coffee. Warmer keeps coffee hot without burning it. The rewarming nice touch. High flow rate. Very EZ to use.  Wish lid would say on .

"December 30, 2010",Motomomma5,5.0,2,not sure what people are talking about the mess? The cups fit perfect when you push the bar to get your coffee. The only possible mess is if when you pour the water in your not careful and it spills out. I love this. Went from a single pod coffee maker to this. Everyone loves how it keeps coffee fresh for 4 hours. Deff a good gift from the hubby!
"June 11, 2015",Sylvia Wadlington,5.0,,"Love it!  Takes a little getting used too after fifty years of using the standard models.  No heavy glass pot to deal with, only downside is there's no window to tell you how much is left in it."
"July 23, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Not the easiest to clean. And I can’t keep it under my counter because the of the steam when it’s staying warm. But love the iced coffee feature. makes great tasting coffee.
"August 20, 2017",Family man,4.0,,Works great. But when it gets to the end of the coffee it drips backwards and gets all over cup and coffee maker.
"October 22, 2019",Brandy,4.0,,Love this machine. The only issue is cleaning it everyday and making sure it’s dry as not to get moldy

"March 19, 2019",lynn,5.0,,Wrynose coffee pot would buy
"March 17, 2010",K Mustain,5.0,One,"This is my second Brewstation. I am very happy with this product. It brews a great cup of coffee. And this model has some extra features my first one did not. I am able to set the brew strength for 1 to 4 cups or up to 12 cups. I also can set the keep warm selector for 1,2,or 3 hours, thats a great feature because on work days I only need a one hour keep warm, and if I forget to turn the pot off before I leave, within minutes the pot shuts off automatically. I would say if your looking for a decent coffee maker, look no farther. This one is great."
"February 25, 2017",Jane tuck,2.0,,Love my coffee maker but the gold filter sold with it is not a good fit. It's to tall. The top won't close all the way. Amazon should not sell them as a fit I'm also finding that the coffee is not kept hot

"June 7, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"We wanted to move away from the Keurig - K cups for environmental reasons.  This coffee maker allows us to do so.  It is quick, easy to use, multiple settings to keep coffee warm (for him) and cooled off (for me).  The machine does tend to leak when moving it across the counter top, or when filling your cup with the last bit of coffee.  Overall, ok."
"July 3, 2019",PAM T,5.0,,I like not having a pot.  It’s very easy to clean
"October 2, 2018",Connie Benzenbower,2.0,,it is very poorly made.  the parts don't fit together as they should.  every time you move the appliance the bottom tray comes apart.  It however makes good coffee.  The one I had previously was made altogether much better than the current model.
"August 27, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"This is the second one I bought mainly for the timer feature so coffee is ready when we get up. The first time I thought it was just a bad one but this one just stopped working 8 months old, the first one lasted about the same."

"July 12, 2015",Kid Plant,5.0,,This is the best coffee maker I have ever bought I did not encounter any of the issues others have complained about. The ones that have spillage issues should indeed get glasses or sober up before using Its much better than the Cuisinart I had that just died. Makes excellent coffee Definitely recommend this product
"December 20, 2020",dedwards,1.0,,"Ever part of it leaks! No matter if you follow the ""cleaning if it drops/leaks"" instructions. Coffee everywhere when you pour a cup!"
"April 5, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Great coffee maker, an improvement on the older design which carried the water in the bottom. The spout is improved so there's less cleaning necessary and you can easily rewarm a pot that has went past the keepwarm hour(s) by restarting it."

"March 6, 2016",Michael R. Florey,1.0,2,"Calling this thing a 'coffee maker' is more than generous. I called it everything BUT a coffee maker. First, repeated scrubbings didn't remove a gawdawful industrial taste. Secondly, the promise of ""no cooked coffee taste"" was a lie. After the 'coffee' was brewed, I could hear a gentle gurgling sound. It turns out the brew was merrily boiling away over the heat transfer plate. Even on regular strength you could float a horse shoe on the crap this thing tried to pass off as coffee. I've made better coffee over a wet campfire. This is a loser in every sense of the word. What a waste of fine coffee. Would I recommend this junk to a friend? Only if I was intent on terminating the friendship. Return it? I got more satisfaction throwing it in the trash."

"March 17, 2016",elkhorne,5.0,One,Best coffee maker I have ever owned. My first one lasted over 10 years. I hope this one lasts another 10 + years as well.
"July 24, 2013",AtlantaBabe,5.0,One,I had an earlier model of this coffee maker that was 2 years old.  It was working great until my husband dropped it while cleaning causing it to leak while in use. So far this one is working just as well. I didn't even consider getting a different model or brand but did shop around for the best price.
"July 9, 2019",Todd H.,5.0,,"We use it every day, liked it so much that I bought my parents one and they love it!"
"November 7, 2016",Shellie,5.0,,Having trouble with the warming mechanism. It takes too long for the coffee to warm. You almost always need to set the program. That would be okay if you are getting up same time everyday.
"March 6, 2021",Allison Eason,1.0,,We returned the first one because it leaks when you get coffee and this one leaks even more. Huge puddle under the coffee pot!
"June 29, 2019",Rich,3.0,,I like everything about everything with this coffee maker EXCEPT the display illumination is brighter than a night light.
"January 6, 2017",Oufan,5.0,,"Love this coffee machine.  Prepare it at night, set it to be done in the morning.  Awesome!  Clearance isn't tall enough for my travel mug.  A piece of 3/4 plywood cut 9 1/2"" wide fixed that problem."
"March 31, 2016",Neddie,4.0,,"Edit: I bumped up my rating because the manufacturer specifically contacted me to try to find a solution, even though I've had the coffee maker for a while. Great company. Very classy! I'm not a fan of this coffee maker. I wish I'd gotten one with a regular carafe instead of one that holds coffee internally. Pros: Makes coffee, does everything you'd expect a coffee maker to do, nice digital display, several options like how long to keep coffee hot, and how strong to brew. Cons: - Impossible to clean because the place where your coffee is held is inside the machine and coffee quickly tastes burnt. There's no carafe to clean. It tells you to clean the thing by brewing vinegar, but I don't want my house to smell like boiling vinegar. - The area to put your cup is not tall and doesn't easily fit a tall coffee cup, so we ended up removing the trap, but that means we get coffee drips on the counter. - The way you add water to the machine is not intuitive and a little annoying because you sort of have to take the whole thing apart. It definitely does the job, and we've used it for about 6 months, but I'm not a fan and plan to replace it soon. If in doubt, get a coffee maker with a carafe. I went back and forth before I got this one and I regret my choice."
"December 25, 2018",Jess,2.0,,It was broken before I even got it and it's a present for my parents. The lid came off and it was missing a piece that was meant to keep the lid up.
"July 25, 2013",jerseymama,1.0,19,"For the third time in one month and five days, this thing has poured all of the coffee in the tank all over my counter.  The first time, I figured out what it was.  The little plunger thing that regulates coffee actually coming out of the machine and into your cup was seated just a hair off center.  It moves slightly from side to side but also sits where it is supposed to.  Maybe I bumped it when pouring the water into the machine?  I carefully set it back in place.  The next time I made coffee, it worked fine.  When it happened again, I thought I had been careless, gotten to cocky, and not checked the little plunger thing.  Well it happened again this morning.  I am VERY careful when making coffee with this thing.  I treat it like a bomb that will explode if I am not completely careful not to make sure that friggin plunger is seated exactly perfectly.  So I found myself again scrambling, filling every coffee mug in the house with the coffee streaming steadily from the brewstation.  At this point, I wanted to throw the thing out the window.  I checked amazon - my return window ended 5 days ago - yay!  Then I got to speak with a very bored and unconcerned hamilton beach representative who said I had to call back when I could get the serial from the bottom of the machine (it's currently still hot and sitting unplugged in a pool of coffee on my counter).  For just $8 more, I can have them send me another tank.  POS.  I'm thinking of saving my money and just getting a run of the mill mr coffee drip coffee maker..."

I saw in some reviews that people had experienced the taste of plastic with the first couple of uses and should run a few cycles without making coffee.

"January 6, 2019",Lou,5.0,,Love not having to use a glass pot coffee maker. Easy to clean and keeps coffee hot without burning. The only thing I wish was that the cord was made longer and self retracted
"May 30, 2019",David A. Bonchik,5.0,,It makes coffee fast and is ready to dispense in no time.
"August 20, 2020",frank mack,3.0,,It stopped working. Leaks and now it doesn't work at all. I did apply for the warranty
"June 5, 2021",Jody. Tompkins,3.0,,I love the look of this.  Works fine other than I find it leaked coffee out of the bottom.  I tightened the bottom panel screws and that helped.  But still leaks some.
"April 16, 2021",Kristina Zerger,1.0,,I’ve had this coffee maker for a week and it runs out onto the counter every day. It makes a huge mess and wastes 1-4 cups of coffee. Would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone.
"January 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I love the ease of dispensing the coffee but it leaks really bad, no matter what I do. It has already stained the countertop from leaking."
"January 11, 2021",l Meyers,2.0,,I love this coffee pot but it leaks so bad!! Everytime I go to clean it I’ll move it and under the whole thing is a puddle of coffee that has leaked. It has ruined my wood table it’s sitting on.
"March 6, 2020",Rochelle,5.0,,"I accidentally ordered the wrong one, but fell in love with it"
"April 24, 2019",Lisa M.,1.0,,The loudest coffeemaker I've ever heard. I prefer my old one over this one. Condensation between coffee basket and coffee reservoir is ridiculous...makes a mess. Wouldn't recommend.
"August 4, 2019",Kelly Banning,5.0,,"Great product for me while visiting my family, don't have to set the time in order to use it as I unplug it when leaving town. Very easy to make coffee and to clean. Perfect for me."

"November 29, 2013",randakost,5.0,3,"I was worried about buying this for two reasons - one that some of the negative reviews were very negative and the other is that it was a gift for my boyfriend and he's not all that into change. I was buying it to replace an old but still functional coffee maker that wasn't programmable and didn't have an automatic turn-off feature. I was always worried it would burn the house down. I loved the idea of this, as he usually just brings a travel mug to work with him in the morning and this would allow him to just come downstairs, fill his mug and go. However, I was worried that as it wasn't a ""conventional"" coffee maker, if it were more complicated he might not want to use it. As I predicted, he wasn't thrilled with it and it sat in the unopened box for about three weeks before I talked him into using it. Now he loves it. It makes great coffee, will stay warm for up to four hours without tasting burnt and it's no more difficult to use than a regular coffee maker. I'd read a lot of reviews about the coffee not dispensing correctly and making a mess, but they must have fixed that because it works perfectly whatever mug or travel cup you use. I bought myself a cheaper conventional coffee maker at the same time, intending to trade it with him if he didn't like the Hamilton Beach. Though it works fine and makes good coffee (Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Chrome) now I find myself wishing I'd bought two of these instead."
"March 25, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Easy to fill.
"June 30, 2018",Karen B.,3.0,,"Slides all over counter, can't get coffee one handed. LED clock is too bright to be able to see the start button. Coffee is slightly weaker than previous version. My wife likes the side fill tank much better than the previous version."
"September 28, 2016",Christian Beyer,1.0,,"Very poor design. Hot coffee reservoir is on top of the water reservoir. If you want to make second pot, you have to handle the very hot reservoir to add water. I used this coffee maker for two weeks and got rid of it."
"May 24, 2020",Leather scent,1.0,,"Every time I pressed my cup to get coffee, machine would leak all over. I returned it for a new one thinking it was faulty and the new one also leaked. Very disappointed. I ended up buying one with a carafe."
"October 6, 2017",Rigor Mortis,3.0,,"Update April 2020:  The plastic tab (inside part) that pushes the plunger open has broken. Everything brews fine; just can't push to pour now. So, its useless now. Used daily for 2.5 years. Update: Oct 2019.  So I've used this daily for 2 years. It still works. I've gotten used to it. Original post: I've owned 2 Brewstations over the past 15 years. Love them. This one...I already hate it. First priority was: It must have an external water reservoir (or easily filled without removing the basket and everything else.)  This was the only version to have the external reservoir. So I was kind of limited in choices. The ANNOYANCES! 1.  The clock light is ALWAYS ON. And its bright. It makes me think its on (when its not). The power button light is the exact same color, so it doesn't stand out as being ON or OFF. 2. The constant rumble of steam and bubbling. The plate warmer shouldn't rumble, which means either A.) the initial heating element (that turns cold water into steam for brewing) is always on, or B.) There is water/condensation leaking under the basket to the plate warmer. Neither option sounds good. 3. The pour button sits too high. The other versions, you sit a coffee cup on the drip plate and kid of ""rock"" the cup to press the button, which holds the machine in place some-what. This one, you have to PUSH AGAINST the coffee maker. So...it must sit against the backsplash (or use one hand to hold the machine in place. Which, then, you run the risk of burning your hand by steam).  And it still wont fit a travel mug under it, which completely negates having the large height. It might be time for me to give-up on Brewstations and go to a thermal carafe. At least that way, once the coffee is done brewing, all or most of the electricity is shut off. I can deal with a small amount of condensation, and an occasional gurgle...but this is just too much."
"March 9, 2020",Mary F. Crowley,4.0,,Why is there no light so I can see the amount of coffee in my mug? Overflowed twice!

"March 11, 2016",JAMY,2.0,,This pot leaks all out of the bottom and  not sure what the problem is with it.  It even holds water in the area where the heating element is. Each morning I have to clean up water in and out of the pot.
"January 3, 2020",Ty Phoenix,1.0,,It keeps leaking everywhere and I have wood countertops. Definitely returning. So disappointed.
"April 23, 2021",Kelly Valensky,1.0,,I had one of this type of coffee pot for 3 years!  I loved it until it started to leak.  I bought a new one and it leaked immediately all over my kitchen! I returned it right away.

"November 30, 2016",R. Francisco,1.0,,Pretty good for a small office setting - not really good for your home. The coffee chamber (if left with coffee) starts to taste like burnt plastic when you dispense coffee- had to return mine.
"August 3, 2017",Jack,5.0,,I love this coffee maker!  We have gone through 4 of these since they have started making them.  They just keep upgrading and getting better.
"June 3, 2019",Kathy Kaiser,5.0,,"This is like the fourth one I have purchased. I love that there is no coffee pot to clean. The coffee will stay hot from 1 to 4 hours warm and you serve by the cup. It's easy to fill, clean and use. I would highly recommend it."
"September 12, 2016",Ed Bryan,5.0,One,"this is my third Brewstation I fell in love with the first one and evryone since, this one is no exception. I do have one issue that after I do the cleaning the only way I can get the ""clean"" warning to go off is unplug and re-plug and reset the time."
"January 12, 2014",lgcottontail,1.0,2,"I bought this to use on weekends.  After maybe nine uses, there is water running all over the counter.  You pick up machine and it runs out of the bottom someplace, continues after coffee is brewed.  Only about half the water ends up with the grinds."
"March 9, 2019",Dealio,5.0,,This coffee maker is great for us because we have granite countertops and end up breaking the glass carafes
"January 20, 2013",mlc7499,5.0,,Had this coffee lot for 3 years. When we needed up getting a keurig for Christmas we packed it away. After 6 mos and hundreds of dollars in k-cups we just couldn't figure the hype or the expense. Husband and I both agree this is a much better cup of coffee for a fraction of the price.
"March 20, 2019",Derek H.,5.0,,Works great
"January 11, 2013",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,"I used the original Brewstation for several years before the clock and timer went out.  I loved that coffee maker.  This maker does not get the coffee warm.  I think it's because the heating plate is so much smaller than the original one.  It's probably 1/3 the size.  With the coffee starting off warm, it gets cold very quickly.  I was so disappointed with it and ended up going to town and buying a regular coffee maker."
"January 1, 2018",Cat A.,5.0,,Love this!  Can make 1 to 10 cups if you want.  I know the Keurig 2 could but it’s a hassle with all of the settings and I am too old to figure them all out.  ;-)

"January 7, 2020",Tawanda Louis,5.0,,Love the fact that this coffee maker allows one cup capability and it doesn't have a pot.
"March 18, 2018",Michelle,1.0,,The little tray falls off the counter if you put it too close to the edge while you're pouring water into it.  The heating element doesn't work very long.  Have to use the microwave to heat it.
"July 30, 2019",Queen of Amazon shopping,2.0,,It was too loud. Heating element made it sound like it was going to explode. Also the tank volume indicator was very difficult to read on the side and with condensation. Not a fan 😩
"March 2, 2021",DJ,5.0,,easy to use
"February 21, 2011",CJ,5.0,One,"Awesome coffee pot!  This thing works like a charm.  Tried it first in a hotel and bought one from Amazon.  No more overflowing coffee grounds, burned coffee or broken carafes!  Very reasonable priced.  This pot is also very easy to use and maintain.  I read other reviews, some were mixed.  I can't understand why everyone did not give this pot the highest rating!"
"May 26, 2015",Buddys Pal,5.0,,This pot is so much better that the newer versions.  I have owned about 5 of the Brew Stations over the years.  The more expensive versions seem to leek and are larger. This is just plain a good design.
"June 2, 2014",J.E. MCCLENDON,5.0,,"As with the Kuerig, i found that my husband had learned  to like this coffee maker at his siters house in florida, and just like the Keurig, I got him this because he has learned to use it. It is easier for some one who has had strokes as there is no carafe to break or spill the coffee."
"December 24, 2020",Corinne Ballew,1.0,,It leaks when you get a cup of coffee. It's drips down the back of the cup.
"January 11, 2013",KDF_Kokopeli,4.0,,"This is much improved over the last model. I liked the last one and it lasted 7 years 3-4 brews a day, This one is much easier to fill and if you cannot fill your cup with this you have serious problems . Don't listen to all the crybabies whining about the dispense button I have had zero problems,great coffee brewer."
"June 6, 2017",John Morley,3.0,,"I'm 70. It's kinda of complicated. I think I liked the carafe type better, but it does as advertised."

"March 31, 2021",Norma Pereira,5.0,,Love this unit!  Every 4-5ish years I have to replace but I get the same one!  Well worth it and I love No glass carafe!
"May 9, 2017",Verogram,5.0,,Love my new coffee maker.  Easy to use.  NO carafe to deal with and you can still make 12 cups! Attractive unit sitting on the counter.
"December 6, 2017",donna,2.0,,Coffee maker quit working after 4 months.  Usually Hamiton Beach coffee makers last a few years this model is not worth the purchase.
"February 7, 2018",MARYSE C. ELYSEE,5.0,,The perfect coffee maker for me. I love using the dispenser and the way the coffee is kept hot for hours. The detachable parts makes it easy to fill the water tank and wash the coffee holder. I don't regret getting this item at all.
"April 17, 2018",Laura Satterly,5.0,,Makes the best tasting coffee! We recommend using distilled water with this product for an even better taste. This is our second coffee maker. We'll buy it again when this one starts to drip/leak because there's not a better product currently made that rivals this one.
"February 23, 2016",Dee,5.0,,"We bought this as an addition to our Keurig, especially when we have multiple people wanting coffee at one time. It is very easy to use and to clean. One handed dispensing is a breeze with this machine and I love the fact that you don't have to worry about breaking a glass carafe."
"December 29, 2016",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"I can't for the life of me brew a good cup of coffee with this machine. A standard cup of coffee is 1 T of grounds per 6 oz but after measuring what the machine says is 6 cups, I discovered it's a 4 oz. cup. Did the math...still a crappy cup of weak and lukewarm at best coffee. I'm giving up on it and pulling the Kuerig back out. Very disappointing."
"July 4, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love this one.  Coffee is fully enclosed so it stays nice and hot!
"November 28, 2017",Michael Roy Blakely,4.0,,"What I like most, is the Cup dispenser, verses the Glass Carafe Pot.  What I like least about it, is that 12 cups isn't large enough!  I wish there was a larger model."
"August 27, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,I love not having a glass carafe to deal with.  I have just gone back to this manufactures pot after dealing with an old style coffee pot.  Water filling with container can be a bit messy as the area to fill is narrow.
"August 17, 2019",TF,5.0,,Love everything about this coffee maker. Great price as well!
"December 5, 2019",jennifer bolton,5.0,,Love not having to worry about breaking a carafe. In and out of a dishwasher was seemingly a kiss of death for previous coffeemakers.
"June 6, 2021",Dawn W,5.0,,"Makes the best coffee,  keeps it hot without the burnt taste. We love it so much, we have 2, one for home and one for when we travel."
"July 7, 2013",M. Mitchell,5.0,,"This coffeemaker is great.  It has programmable settings so your coffee will be ready when you wake up, or have that pot ready when you arrive home after a long day at work.  The coffee stays hot for up to 4 hours and because it is stored in a sealed pot there is not burnt taste.  I recommend this coffeemaker to everyone."
"April 1, 2017",S. Babbitt,1.0,,"I've never had a problem with one of these before, but mine has stopped working after two months. Not Happy At All!"
"September 24, 2019",Jonathan Glica,4.0,,It's ok.  I don't really think it's any better then a regular coffee maker.
"June 28, 2018",Consumer,4.0,,"The only problem is that you have to fill it by lifting the lid up and taking the pot out from under it, so it's a pain to use in the cabinet. Liked the old style better."
"November 23, 2016",jean,5.0,One,great coffee pot holds the coffee hot for specified time no burnt taste easy to use would highly recommend
"June 29, 2019",Rayleen Hubbard,5.0,,I love this coffee maker!  It’s perfect.
"March 26, 2017",ronald,1.0,One,i bought this on feb9th and the program button no longer works.it also sounds like it is going to blow up. I use it once a day so it is not like it gets a hard workout. I am very unhappy that I can not exchange this item. I love this type of coffee maker however I can not recommend a coffee pot that only works 40 days. I think it should be replaced.
"November 20, 2019",Miatta Mcgill,4.0,,My only problem is setting the timer for brewing is tricky. I did once and couldn't remember how the next day. As if you have to read the instruction again to get it right. But I love it besides that.
"March 17, 2021",Thomas Hill,5.0,,All good
"July 12, 2017",Jgru,1.0,One,"I purchased this item in September 2016 and unfortunately it started malfunctioning around April 2017 (about 6 months later). I finally went ahead and ordered another coffee maker because it was defective. Amazon.com always has OUTSTANDING customer service and refunded me for this product, but I just want to forewarn other potential customers that some of these machines may be defective."
"February 25, 2020",Regina M,5.0,,Love the removable water reservoir and the dispenser instead of karaf. Love that it makes up to 12 cups and timer with options for keeping it hot.

"June 29, 2016",renee,5.0,,Love love love it!!!always buy Hamilton Beach!!! Only problem that I have is the Brew Station Hamilton Beach logo on the tank has come off almost completely!  Last one I had the ink stayed on a lot longer! Have had this only since May 17 of this year!! Other than that I love this coffee maker!!! Have bought 4-5 of them!
"April 12, 2017",JC,5.0,,Purchased this coffee maker for the office.  Everyone loves how easy it is to dispense directly into a cup. No mess and easy to clean.
"September 24, 2019",Linda Mackesy,1.0,,With the newer design I had to return two coffee makers because they would not shut off. Back to just a regular coffee maker and that’s too bad because I have had a Brew Station for as long as I can remember!

"May 28, 2019",lowenbrown873,5.0,,Easy to use and clean with minimum counter space
"May 2, 2018",janna parson,5.0,,Love this coffee maker.  My shaky dad always spilled coffee when pouring from a glass pot.  Now he just holds his cup to the dispenser for a nice hot cup and he never spills a drop.  I like more than the Keurig. And the price is right.
"May 7, 2020",Denice Vest,1.0,,Didn’t last very long.... no longer keeps coffee hot...
"December 27, 2016",Don,5.0,,highly recommend it. i bought it as a replacement for my more expensive coffee make with an easily broken glass carafe. works well
"July 31, 2014",Blackcloud Ar.,2.0,,"Water collects below where coffee is from steam while making coffee.  Has to be wiped up each time.  When I called Hamilton Beach to complain about it, before I could even start telling her the problem, she said, ""Are you calling about water collecting in base?""  She says everyone calling complains about it and in fact, they have same pot in their own office and it does the same thing. Would not do anything about it."

"February 27, 2017",Losse,1.0,,I ran 48 cups of water through it.  Still has a strong plastic smell to the water.  Looks like it would have been a cool coffee maker otherwise.
"February 2, 2018",Carla Clawson,5.0,,Easy to make coffee with timer. I love the internal carafe. I no longer have to hear my hunny get upset when he spills coffee while he pours himself a cup. Definitely a fool-proof product.

"August 20, 2018",Karen Stenson,3.0,,"this unit makes good coffee, both hot and iced.  The problem I have with the unit is that it continually slowly drips from the dispenser and of course we didn't figure out the issue until after the 30 day return policy expired.

"July 7, 2011",Slothy McSlothFace,5.0,One,"I cant say enough about this coffeemaker. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  I like to make my own iced lattes and this is does it to perfection. The coffee brews quickly, its really easy to use and takes up much less counter space than my previous coffee maker did. I will recommend this to anyone considering a new coffee maker"
"September 4, 2014",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"This is a revised review.  This coffee maker is a total disappointed.  It leaks a lot of water all over countertop, as other reviews have said.  Also after 4 months it has stared to make a lot of noise.  I am a previous owner of BrewStations and loved them.  This one is awful and will not purchase another one"
"December 16, 2020",REBECCA STANLEY,1.0,,I'm going to have to return this for the second time.  This leaks where you push in with the cup to get the coffee.  I'm very disappointed because I had one several years ago and loved it.
"January 29, 2011",Seattle Girl,5.0,21,"My cousin gave me this type of coffee maker several years ago and after constant daily use, it finally started not keeping the coffee hot enough so I replaced it with this current model. I think it's a bargain and I really like the no-coffee-pot maker. The coffee stays hot for 0-4 hours (a nice new added feature). I set the coffee maker at night and like magic it's there waiting for us when we wake up. I love the convenience and this current model is much nicer and easier to use than the old model. The newer design is much sleeker and I like being able to eye the water tank, which the new design offers. I would buy this coffee maker again, hands down."
"December 11, 2019",D. Cox,5.0,,I love the look of this maker. I always use the ones without carafes because there is no cleaning them. And it makes the best coffee that never burns.
"January 21, 2016",Jef!,1.0,,Waste of $30.  Coffee comes out lukewarm (so I guess it's great if you only plan on making iced drinks). Wish I hadn't thrown away the box - I would return this thing today.
"November 27, 2014",Jo Ann,5.0,One,Bought this to replace an older model.  The old one was still working just fine but I liked some of the changes in design of the newer model.  I would not consider buying any other brand or model.

"October 7, 2019",SALLY,5.0,,Makes great coffee.  Easy to use.
"May 21, 2019",DOGONIT1,5.0,,"The ease of setup was great, minimal learning curve."
"December 26, 2016",LR78,4.0,,"We bought this to replace another Hamilton Beach coffee maker that had finally worn out after a few years. I have always had good luck with HB brewers and wanted to stick with the brand. I was searching for something with a thermal carafe rather than a glass one with a hot plate, which is what we were replacing, when I ran across this carafeless option. We've now had it for a couple of months and are pleased with it.The only downside of not having a carafe is that my husband and I would typically bring the carafe out to refill each other's coffee if we were sitting in another room. I suppose we could fill a thermal carafe and use that, but it's an extra step we haven't felt the need to take. It just means two trips; one to retrieve the cup and one to bring it back full. Frankly, the exercise is welcome. I did not experience the issues that others mentioned with the pour spout being too close to the back of the dispenser area or the leakage outside of the unit upon opening the lid, so these design issues may have been corrected in later models. There was significant condensation that dripped when the lid was opened, but it all dripped back into the reservoir, so no issues there. There is a lot of dripping out of the brew basket when I lift it to empty, but I just wait for a few seconds to let it finish before transporting the basket to the trash. The timer works great, and it's nice having the adjustable keep warm function. We haven't used it to make iced coffee yet, but will probably use that function in the summer as our daughter likes iced coffee. The coffee tastes fine now that we have dialed in the amounts we like. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's certainly not bad, and to be fair, we haven't experimented with different beans, since we generally like what we have. The only negative for me and really it's not so much a negative as a place for improvement is that the reservoir is plastic, and I think the taste would probably be improved if the reservoir was metal or perhaps thermal. I would have gladly paid more for this machine if that were the case. I don't think keeping coffee warm in a plastic reservoir is doing anything to sustain the flavor over a period of hours, and while I'm sure it's food grade, I would feel a little more confident in drinking something that had not been kept hot in plastic for that long. That is, of course, just my opinion, and I have no basis for safety concerns, so YMMV. This makes our third or fourth HB machine over many years, and they continue to live up to our expectations and last far longer than the price point would give us hope for."
"July 3, 2020",Jennifer,1.0,,"Don’t waste your money. It leaks, burns coffee if left in the reservoir longer than 20 min, and stopped working after 6 months."
"February 7, 2020",Glynda Durk,5.0,,I love the fact that you dont have to remove the pot to get a cup of coffee
"January 15, 2018",Adam M,1.0,,"Product was great for 9 months, but started to leak into the base, then onto my counter, and finally shorted out altogether. No customer service to response when I asked them about a replacement. I really don't want to buy a coffee maker every year."

"October 3, 2016",tnbiker,5.0,,"EXCELLENT! I have used it daily for several months now. Great taste, you can program to be brewing before you wake up, easy to clean, heats for 4 hours and tastes as fresh at 4 as it did at 1."
"October 7, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,,This coffee pot would beep and stop making coffee for no reason. I threw it out this morning.
"January 1, 2021",Dreama Pinson,1.0,,I have ordered two of these coffee makers in a week both of them leaked. I think it is a design flaw. I have never had a problem with Hamilton Beach before.
"January 23, 2018","Albert Cernadas, Jr",1.0,,"Well, it just doesn’t ma good tasting coffee.  Whatever other features this coffee maker may have, it simply does not matter if the coffee produced is not a rich brewed coffee.  I also had to put the coffee into the microwave to get it hot.  I had a no frills $15 coffee maker that lasted 18 months and that made much better coffee."
"June 6, 2019",Pretty feet,2.0,,"Makes way to much noise when warmer is on. I guess you get what you pay for. It makes coffee, just cant keep it warm."
"December 27, 2019",David,5.0,,Looks great. And easy to use.
"March 26, 2016",SAM,1.0,7,"We are now on our 3rd HB 12-cup coffee maker. The first one kept saying ""add water"" but I already had!  Amazon replaced it fast. The second one lasted a little over a month then one morning the screen was blank. We are now on our 3rd coffee maker. HB wanted to charge me shipping but I insisted they ship it out for free-so they did. That being said when they work right they make good coffee (per my family). But if you could just get an Hamilton Beach coffee maker to last for at least a year it would be great."
"December 6, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Like separate water container. Dislike tendency to get too hot and leave burned flavor.
"June 14, 2019",Ben ross,5.0,,Hell yea! And it makes cold coffee that'll make you check your heartrate? Bet your ass!
"July 21, 2020",kalette james,1.0,,"We used the previous version of this for years but this new model only makes 4 cups and then stops. The 3 pieces are a bit more of a hassle to work with, also. Returning."

"September 19, 2019",Devout Sceptic,5.0,,We like the no-carafe dispenser. It is a little on the tall side (but not excessively so).  Working great so far.

"March 22, 2017",Mary,4.0,,"I love this coffee machine. This is my 2d one, wore the first out. The only thing I see is that it makes woosh sounds. Doesn't bother anything. It makes the best coffee and holds it hot for 4 hrs. The cup of coffee is great even at the 4 hrs point."
"March 18, 2016",Daisy's Dad,5.0,One,Easy to use at 4:45 am.  It is a very good coffee pot.  Really like how it dispenses the coffee so quickly.
"September 26, 2019",TRock,2.0,,Love this Coffee maker but have had to buy three now.  They stop poring correctly after two years.  Really disappointed in the life of this coffee maker but really like its usefulness not to give it another try.

"November 6, 2015",JP,5.0,,"Love this coffee machine! Makes a delicious cup of coffee, super easy to clean, keeps coffee from getting that gross burned flavor. I love not having a carafe, less mess, and I have not had any of the dribbling problems other reviews have mentioned."

"February 23, 2017",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"We used this product at a hotel when we were on vacation.  We loved it then and still love it.  The coffee is keep hot and is easy to access, love not having to pour out the coffee."

"October 15, 2011",Greybeard,4.0,One,"I like this coffee maker better than the standard carafe type.  The single cup feature seems to keep the coffee hotter which is important to me.  It also is easier to clean and set up for the next morning.  Plus, hey listen up, plus it looks very cool, adds to the decor of a bachelor's kitchen and I need all the help I can get.  My only complaint is that I haven't figured out how to have it start automatically for the next morning, but I can't figure out a lot of things so it is not a big deal to walk in the kitchen when I awake and push the button."
"October 13, 2019",Joseph Klosinski,1.0,,This coffee pot has started leaking all over the counter and no longer is making a full pot of coffee. Worse part is now it’s past the return time frame.
"October 11, 2019",Veraflmom,3.0,,The water reservoir would not hook up to the unit- had to use my old reservoir Also the new reservoir is plain black not stainless steel like before
"August 8, 2014",sarah,1.0,One,"This product just stopped working after less than 8 months (said ""fill water"" even though it was full, no way to repair). I contacted Amazon after reading that Hamilton Beach is notoriously bad at honoring warranties, and the process is complicated and time consuming. They told me the product return window had expired and that I should contact Hamilton Beach. I mentioned that I was disappointed in this as they're the ones selling a defective product from a company that has many complaints regarding warranties and that I would accept the fact that they can't take it back for a refund but I would be sure to mention it in my review. They then offered me a refund of 80% of the purchase price since it was out of the return window. Kudos to Amazon for making it (partially) right after selling a defective product to a loyal prime customer. Hamilton beach, you suck."
"June 12, 2013",Ronnie Zatkoff,4.0,,"I love the coffee maker; looks great and keeps the coffee very hot. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is becuase my travel mug still doesn't quite fit underneath the dispenser I haven't really foujnd a coffee makers that does however...but from the picture, I thought mine would"
"December 4, 2014",AdamKi,5.0,,"This really is a great coffee maker.  I had the version that had the water basin along the back of the coffee maker which was always difficult to pour water into.  This new design with the open water tank is perfect.  Makes great coffee.  Stays warm for up to 4 hours very well without problems.  Automatic setting works great.  I will say that sometimes it is difficult, as others have made mention of, to see the amount of coffee you have in your cup if you are filling a travel mug, but otherwise a great coffee maker."
"February 8, 2018",Frank,1.0,,Worked great for about a month then the heating element to keep the coffee warm went out.

"September 18, 2019",Wesley Hackelton,5.0,,"So far, it’s made coffee every time I’ve put coffee grounds and water in it. So, I guess you could say I’m pretty satisfied."
"May 21, 2016",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,At first it was great. Easy to use with no heavy lifting or pouroing. But after 4 months the machine began to malfuntion. It would randomly shut off durring brewing. After a few days it just woulndt pull the water to brew. I'm not sure what's wrong with it but I'm sure disapointed. This has always been a good product line.
"July 16, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,Good coffee maker except that it does leak a lot when serving into the coffee cups.  Have to clean up every time we get a cup of coffee
"February 26, 2016",paulg,4.0,,"Easy to use and coffee tastes good. Great price so I will most likely replace it after a year. Coffee makers, regardless of price get pretty nasty even with regular cleaning."
"June 18, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love the coffee maker. Works great! Super hot coffee for hours. But it's a little bit loud while brewing.

"August 24, 2015",Michael W.,5.0,One,I don't know what all the negative feedback is about concerning the spill factor of the coffee dispenser.  I have yet to have a spill and am enjoying the functionality of the coffee pot.  Great product and works well for me.
"January 2, 2017",emily weidman,5.0,,"I purchased this Hamilton Beach  after having a Bosum pour over for quite some time. I love the pour over, but it's kind of a hassle during the week. The Hamilton Beach is very easy to set up as far as initial use, brew time, options for how long to keep coffee warm, brew strength, etc. I've had no leaking, as I have with several high end brands in the past. Ceramic travel mugs fits in dispensing area easily. Really great coffee maker for the price."

"June 28, 2018",Pamela Wilson,1.0,,"We loved it at first but it's been only 3 months and we had some power cycling issues and it leaks all over the counter. Don't buy, not worth it since you will have to buy a new one relatively soon after."

"March 1, 2015",Caren Benge,5.0,,"We had one of these before and loved it, so when our latest coffeemaker stopped brewing, I searched out another. It functions perfectly, just as it should. We enjoy having no carafe - there's much less chance of spills/splashes."

"February 11, 2019",David,5.0,,We had the old one for years. A little plastic piece became so brittle from dispensing the coffee through the years it finally broke. But we love it so we got a new one. First thing I did was examine the piece that had broken on the first one and it is made with a harder thicker piece. So it looks like they figured out how to make it last longer.
"June 30, 2020",Ray Robitaille,1.0,,"Had this coffee maker for many years and it was great. Replaced it mid May 2020 and no, end of June, it makes but then leaks the coffee all over the counter. Would not recommend"
"January 8, 2016",Ty,4.0,,"Coffee maker works well & has been reliable. The only thing i don't like about it is that none of my thermos' fit under the dispenser, and it is very easy to burn your hands when tilting the unit in order to fill a thermos. If you drink out of a mug, this is perfect, if not you might consider a different model."
"January 3, 2020",MaryEtta Taylor,5.0,,This coffee maker is my favorite! It keeps the coffee hot for ad long as needed without altering the flavor.
"August 1, 2016",Tynette Henson,3.0,One,"The side water reservoir is convenient and easy to fill.  Programmable features are also easy to use and useful. Cons- Coffee does not dispense as hot as I prefer-- when emptying the  interior tank (where the coffee is), it tends to seep out of the side seams as well as the small pour spout... messy."
"August 17, 2014",K. Jackson,1.0,3,I started loving this pot but it ended up being a disaster... As soon as the return date came around it simply died. I have never seen such a short life in any other coffee maker I have bought. Stay away if you want a coffee maker that lasts longer than a month or two..

"June 4, 2016",k9882,4.0,,I wish I had spent the extra $10 on the one with the side reservoir. Filling it is kind of a pain. Otherwise we love this coffee maker.
"October 20, 2015",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I love almost everything about my BrewstationBrewstation. You can make iced coffee, set a brew time, set how long it will keep your coffee warm, and it even comes with a little recipe book for flavored drinks. I also purchased a reusable filter and now I never have to go to a coffee shop in the morning! My only complaint is that it is too tall to store and use beneath my kitchen cabinets or on my kitchen shelf. It fits snugly but because access to the well and filter are beneath covers that flip upwards, I was forced to find a new place for it."
"July 8, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"Like the ""no carafe"" feature and the fact it has adjustable ""on"" time."
"June 29, 2019",Rhonda Rolandson,1.0,,2nd one of these  First one broke after a year. This one was a replacement and has also already broke. Both times had to do with the serve button. Won’t buy another
"August 25, 2019",john p.,5.0,,"I love this coffee pot.  Keeps coffee hot 4hrs I stead of 2hrs.  No caraffe taking up more space.  Ive had no issues with this, been 1 1/2 months since I bought it."
"February 7, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,It works fine and is pretty easy to use but it doesn’t keep the coffee hot even though it has an option to “keep warm” for up to 4 hours. It stays warm but not hot.

"September 18, 2015",Diann M. Jones,5.0,,"This was to replace a much older model that was getting too hot.  I just started using it and it is great. Love the bold brew setting, and the keep hot for up to 4 hours."
"December 27, 2012",Sharon H. Joyner,5.0,,"Love this particular brand and style of coffeemaker, and so reasonably priced. We never follow the cleaning directions to get rid of hard water deposits inside the coffeemaker, hence they don't last forever, however they do last about five years or so. This is our third one. Love the fact that we can set it up to brew at any particular time, can keep it warm for up to four hours, and that since coffee doesn't sit in a glass pot on a burner, there's no scorched coffee. The last cup at the four-hour mark is just as delicious as the first cup! Love the 12-cup capacity, too!"
"January 4, 2017",MikeyT,5.0,,love it.  much cheaper than keurig and seems to do the same thing .  also includes a way to brew regular coffee in it.

"January 3, 2016",Linda Phillippy,5.0,,"Love the ""no glass pot"".  Love the option to keep it on for 2, 3 or 4 hours.  I use the 4 hours all the time and the coffee does not get strong.  It  must reheat in longer intervals and keeps the coffee tasting fresh.  Best coffee maker I've ever had.... and I've gone through plenty."
"November 17, 2016",L. Johnson,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. Very straight forward and love the keep warm function. It is pretty tall which can make it awkward and compared to other coffee makers I'd just saying cleaning it is the most difficult thing. But it's been a blessing to my mornings, has not added 1 extra minute to my routine."

"October 13, 2017",Kirsten S.,2.0,,"Started out fine, but soon started to notice that coffee leaked down the front of the machine while dispensing a cup.

"June 4, 2017",Ana,5.0,,"This was one great purchase from Amazon. It looks good, makes coffee as I like it and you can change the settings and set a timer. All in all, great buy, I recommend it."
"May 20, 2010",Janice Battinelli,4.0,5,"There are many imporvements between this and the previous models of Brewstations we have had over the years.  I will not be redundant in repeating what others have said but there are a few quick fixes to a few problems people are experiencing: Tighten all screws when you get it, because they may not have been tightened enough prior to shipping, or they could have become loosened during shipping. While I have no fix for the condensation that forms on the inside of the lid, having a hand towel ready to catch any condensation when it trickles down the back seems to be the only solution.  I think this model has more condensation than previous models because of the fact that they made the area between the dispencer and the holder that catches any coffee overflow taller.  This was to compensate for the units overall size so that it still fits under most cabinets, and why they made the coffee basket shorter. Some people have complained about the noise of this model.  I contacted Hamilton Beach, who kindly sent me out a new tank to see if this was the problem, and it is not.  The tank is a bit loose fitting. so to stop the noise, I just made a thick strip out of some rubber draw liner so that it fits only in the very front of the tank.  I just place this under the front of the tank after i pour the water in and it has taken care of the noise. Some people have been complaining that they are also spilling water all over the counter when filling the water from the tank into the unit.  If you just hold the tank a little bit higher, I noticed that there does not seem to be any spillage.  I saw that a few people also seem to think that there is not a big enough opening for them to pour the water, but quite frankly, I do not see a problem.  The only place where water does drip is off the two peaks on the tank, but as long as I do not rush, and hold the tank high enough, there is no dripping at all. I also noted that people are complaining that they cannot simply turn the unit back on after the four hour limit has run out.  Hamilton Beach suggests heating up your coffee in the microwave at that point, and if you do not like the way your coffee tastes in the microwave (as I feel about it), it is just as easy to brew less coffee at one time.  There are multiple settings for different cup amounts, different timer settings, and quite a few variations thereof to take care of that problem as well. Some people have reported peoblems or difficulty in cleaning the inside of the tank. First of all, I use the same cleaner as I do on my glass stovetop to clean the metal heating element.  Cleaning this is not any harder than te round element on other Brewstation models.  I have not tried it, but it also appears as though the little mesh screen inside the tank is removeable for ease of cleaning.  In addition, Hamilton Beach states that the tank can go in the top rack of the dish washer for cleaning as well.  I have not done this, but if you do, be sure that it goes on the top rack only.  If your top rack is not tall enough to fit the tank, I would not suggest placing it in the dishwasher. I hope that this is helpful.  Overall, I am just as satisfied with this Brewstation as I have been with previous models. With that being said, I have had this model for about a month now with no real problems.  This is my fourth Brewstation, and I will continue to stand by Hamilton Beach, and their products. They have great customer service, and a $50.00 unit such as this lasts for quite a few years, as long as you it descale, clean it out well and take care of it."
"February 28, 2021",Cynthia Cornelison,5.0,,This is the best coffee pot I've ever bought
"February 5, 2020",Amanda Talley,5.0,,Love that I can set a timer the night before so that when I wake up I have immediate access to all of the coffee by just pressing my mug against a button. My coffee never tastes burnt and cleaning it out is extremely easy. 10/10 would recommend.
"July 12, 2021",robert baggett jr,5.0,,wife loves it
"April 19, 2020",Todd,2.0,,The coffee is fine it's just when you pour each cup of coffee some leaks and runs down the faceplate into the liquid catch.  This shouldn't happen every time you want to refill your cup.  I returned the product.
"May 12, 2021",Kindle Customer,2.0,,This is the 3rd Brew Station I've had over the years. Love them...... Until this one. It leaks! Really disappointed. Not sure what I'm going to do.
"May 6, 2020",Larry Sims,2.0,,This is the second Brew Station I have had. The first was awesome for years. This new one drips hot coffee on my counter and hand when I get a cup.
"June 23, 2017",firemtn,5.0,,"We enjoy using it. Makes great coffee, easy to refill and clean"
"July 22, 2016",Geoffrey L Bowden,1.0,,"I've had trouble with the coffee tank valve jamming open and releasing all the coffee. Maybe it is just my particular one but I can't recommend this model based on my experience. Went back to my old, stored in the basement B&D Spacemaker which still seems to work fine."
"April 5, 2020",Nikki,5.0,,The only problem is that it leaks if you don’t dispense all of the coffee.  Love it other than that.
"May 12, 2019",AA,4.0,,"This product is easy to clean, does not alter the taste of the coffee and the scheduled brewing comes in really handy.  You wake up with a fresh cup of coffee.  I would have given this a 5-star rating but reduced one star because of quality.  On its 5th month now, the ""keep warm"" function just stopped working."
"February 18, 2019",Kayla,5.0,,Great but hard to clean
"February 15, 2015",John Countryman,4.0,,"It's a pretty reliable product, and I'm glad I got it.  Some of the parts/covers don't fit well in their intended places, such as the cover over the water reservoir and the steel drain plate at the base. It's user friendly otherwise and perfect for those of us who prefer not to have a carafe."
"October 4, 2018",Memelonn,1.0,,"The leaking was impossible to solve, we had to buy a new traditional machine because the leaking mess was not manageable. Do not buy this product."
"June 12, 2019",Chrystalee Begody,5.0,,Needed to replace our old coffee maker and this was absolutely what we needed
"February 27, 2021",RODERIC OCONNOR,3.0,,Makes a lot of noise like the coffee is constantly being cooked there is a constant simmering noise like the coffee is being boiled.
"June 18, 2019",Michelle Mcdaniel,5.0,,Great coffee maker. Easy to use and clean
"December 4, 2014",WVU_93,5.0,,"Have been a big fan of this product for years, 3rd one and definitely not the last.  Seller was very good about getting the order out right away and was actually a day or two ahead of the scheduled delivery date.  Would definitely use this seller for purchase again."
"November 26, 2015",Gordie,4.0,One,The maker has nice features. It brews coffee at 170 f. I live in Colorado at 6000 ft. above sea level and water doesn't get as hot as sea level. So 170 is pretty good for a cheap maker. At $35 this is a great deal.
"June 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,I don't care for this but wanted something different and I got it!  It leaks.  More awkward to make coffee.  Don't hate it but not crazy about it.
"September 6, 2013",Kindle Customer,3.0,One,Bought this for our beach rental unit.  The loading of water is not intuitive.  Coffee always has a burnt taste due to the way its kept warm.  Larger coffee travel mugs do not fit under the opening.  Lack of lighting under the opening makes it difficult to know when cup is full.
"December 16, 2019",Melissa Bacon,1.0,,This coffee pot would be perfect other then the fact that it leaks when you press the dispenser button. We have to keep a paper towel under it to catch all the coffee the trickles out.
"April 13, 2016",Lu,5.0,,"This works as expected, I use it everyday! I do put in 2 scoops per one cup of water to get the strength I like though, that might be different for everyone."
"July 29, 2019",Harry,5.0,,Good quality
"April 30, 2017",Sarah,1.0,,I have only had this for a year and it is suddenly no longer dispensing coffee. I came on my order history to see what the return policy was because it seems ridiculous that this would be a one year disposable item but unfortunately I can't find anything. Surprised at the this. I'd not buy this again.
"December 26, 2020",Jallan55,5.0,,Best coffee maker I ever owned!
"June 26, 2021",Dorothy Stedman,5.0,,Ease of use
"October 18, 2017",Mary Adkins-Mattthews,5.0,,better than a Kurig if you want more than one cup
"June 22, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Love love this coffee maker!  So easy to use, the dispenser is effortless and convenient! Will never go back to a glass carafe or a Kuerig again!"
"January 8, 2018",DonutDrRon,1.0,,Leaks all over the counter. Bad valve makes it drip until the tiny catch trough is full and overflows everywhere!
"November 16, 2014",Gloria Hickman,5.0,,This is great.  My husband is physically impaired and can't hold a carafe on a regular coffeemaker.  But he can use this one because he just has to push his cup against it and  get his own coffee.  We love the convenience of it.
"October 18, 2017",Herta Z. Dane,5.0,,"Best coffee maker ever, we LOVE it, it does not drip AT ALL!"
"March 4, 2010",Bikerchick,4.0,,"Having a ""HOT"" cup of coffee each and every time is wonderful!  So much so that the cons are not a BIG hassle to me.  Cons: Unless you tap the top before opening it after brewing, it drips on counter.  And if you use a THICK lip coffee mug, the pour spout it not out far enough. If these changes were made this coffee maker would be a 5 plus star!!!"
"March 30, 2013",JimmyP79,4.0,,"I would've given this product 5 stars but there are some things I don't like about it. 1) You have to disassemble the entire top portion to fill it with water. 2) Because it has so many parts to it, the brewer seems flimsy if you slide it on the counter.. 3) I don't mind this at all but some of you might. The clock does not keep time, but the 3 other clocks in my kitchen do so it's not a huge problem. But if you don't have a clock in the kitchen and you want a brewer that keeps time as well, this isn't right for you. So far I am happy with my purchase."
"August 12, 2016",Donald Carasso,2.0,2,"It was a good coffee pot, for about a year, and then started slowly leaking, and now it’s not good anymore, then we go back to my old coffee pot."
"June 22, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,Does not brew your coffee hot more like Luke warm! Not sure if I got one with a bad heating element or not. I've only ever bought this brand and have never had this issue. Very disappointed I shouldn't have to put my coffee in the microwave right after it's been brewed....
"October 1, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"Needs to be against a wall... Mine is on a kitchen island and I have to hold it, so I don't push it off the counter."
"December 26, 2020",Michael Gahagan,1.0,,It leaks
"May 29, 2017",Nancy Purves,1.0,2,This is the worst performing coffee maker I have ever owned.  I put in twelve cups of water but only 10 cups of coffee is produced and the coffee is less than hot.
"November 11, 2019",Darrell Neal,5.0,,Makes great coffee and is fast
"January 31, 2020",joyce,5.0,,second 1 i owned coffee is great never burnt  taste ready when i get up would buy another
"January 19, 2021",dean hager,1.0,,It leaks out of the bottom since day one
"November 29, 2017",Craig,1.0,,Product came broken! A spring rolled out onto the floor when I took it out of the box. Also the container that holds the finished coffee had a hole in it!!! What a POS!
"August 26, 2013",M. C. Stan,5.0,,"My hubby and I have used Mr. Coffee machines and we drink 12 cups a day. Switching to this machine was an unexpected pleasure. We love the dispenser with all different size cups, including giant cups. It is much easier to maintain than a carafe. I will never go back to the carafe way..."
"May 21, 2020",Bubble gum,5.0,,Really like it
"September 26, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I love this product this is the third pot like this that I’ve had. I hope they don’t discontinue it. Don’t have to worry about a carafe breaking
"November 19, 2015",Sarah Rausch,5.0,One,"This is a replacement coffee maker since our other one was breaking (about 3 years old).  We absolutely love it.  I tend to be clumsy when I don't have my coffee, this makes it easy since I can't break a carafe.  It is easy to program so when I need to get up in the morning to get my oldest to kindergarten after a long night of cluster nursing my baby and negotiating with another tiny human as to why things are the way they are... well it gives me a little happiness in my cup!"
"September 17, 2019",Digital Magic,5.0,,Works great. Brews fast with excellent flavor. Hope it lasts longer than others but when it dies I'll buy another.
"November 13, 2015",NanC,4.0,One,This is my second one.  Really good brewer and does not cook the coffee.  I'll keep buying them as long as they make them.  I can't go for the one cup coffee makers until they come up with one that does not use pods.
"December 13, 2019",Pam,3.0,,When you make  extra coffee to come back and get it taste burnt and not too good
"January 5, 2014",Ani,4.0,,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad last year. He loves it so much that he got one for my sister this Christmas. It's easy to use and convenient if you drink a little coffee or a whole pot. If there is any complaint, it would be that the dispenser seems to be a bit clogged causing the stream of coffee to be slower than when it was first bought. Keurigs are great but not convenient for someone like my dad and sister who will drink a few cups of coffee early in the day instead of spread over the course of hours."
"September 9, 2015",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"We bought this to replace a broken one.  Really like not having to deal with a coffee container - dispenses directly to cup.  Keeps coffee hot and can be adjusted for brew strengths, automatic start, etc."
"March 29, 2019",PoppaRick,5.0,,"This is actually our second brew station since I broke the first one.  Coffee is always brewed the way you prefer, cleans easy."
"February 4, 2020",Mervat,5.0,,great for party hosting and a coffee bar
"August 30, 2017",Terri,3.0,,When I turn the coffee pot off And when I1 to reheat it a couple hours later there's no way to do it 😠
"September 10, 2016",Diane K,4.0,One,I like it but prefer the older model with the tank on the side.
"March 18, 2021",Cheryl Piatt,5.0,,Nothing that i do not like!!!
"October 12, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,With the side container for water I no longer make a mess pouring water into the machine
"January 16, 2017",MistyTownsley,5.0,,Exactly what I was looking for! Tip: when removing it from that packaging be careful. The hinged lid is on top of the water tank which separates from the main base.
"March 5, 2020",Nictrahan,2.0,,We loved the way it dispensed coffee but it only last a month before it stopped working. Even with cleaning it every ten brews.
"August 8, 2020",truman guynn,4.0,,"for some reason the coffee valve does not work right, and coffee leaks under the pot. tried replacing the tank, still leaks."
"September 16, 2020",Karen M. Zuggi,1.0,,I had the previous version with a detached water tank.  Thought this was the same.  Hate the way you fill water and can’t wait to replace it.
"April 30, 2017",Carrie,5.0,,We LOVE this coffee maker. It is so convenient and easy to use. It makes great coffee too
"February 8, 2014",ORDRn,4.0,One,"We haven't had it long, but it works well.  It's easy to use.  I like that I can make enough coffee at once for everyone.  We can all sit and drink our coffee and visit.  Being able to fill one cup at a time gives us choices. The only thing that bothers me is that the water holder doesn't sit flush against the coffeepot.  It's just one of those annoying looking things.  I've examined it every way, and it just doesn't sit straight up and down.  You can even see it on the picture, but I guess I missed it.  For the price I think it should fit right."
"September 16, 2017",Adam,5.0,,Still works great almost a year later.  Highly recommend.
"December 26, 2016",BCD,5.0,One,Excellent quality & price.....Excellent quality & price......Excellent quality & price.......Excellent quality & price.....great product design too!!!!
"March 11, 2016",RC,5.0,,"LOVE THIS COFFEE POT!!!! I can't say it enough! It is just perfect. I don't care for single serve machines. I do not like water sitting in a reservoir... And this brilliant coffee maker makes a full pot of coffee but no ""pot"" to clean, forget anout and burn... And I get compliments from everyone who sees it!!! 5 star without a doubt. I'd give higher of I could! 👍🏻"
"May 11, 2013",R E Gunn,5.0,One,"My local drive-thru coffee stand closed and I didn't like the alternatives. So I was looking for a programmable, easy-to-use coffee maker that would make a small amount. Bingo! I now set it up the night before and have fresh, hot coffee when I'm ready to head out the door in the morning. I especially like not having a carafe as I find they don't keep the heat well, and are a pain to clean. The other great feature is the ability to program the ""keep warm"" time and know it will turn off if I forget. It is also nice to know I can make a full pot of coffee if I'm entertaining."
"May 4, 2021",Gloria Skogley,1.0,,"The coffee maker leaks coffee if any is left in the receptacle, making a large mess to clean up.  Would not recommend this machine to anybody."
"July 26, 2016",Amanda Laurel,5.0,,Love how it's so easy to clean!!!!  No real complaints- only wonder what is best way to clean the lid part (I put a lot of grinds in the filter and it's enough to touch the top and leave wet grinds on lid part. I'm afraid to remove it in case I can't put it back). Other than that really you can't beat the price.
"August 20, 2018",Mary S.,5.0,,Makes good coffee.  I had one before and liked it too.
"November 7, 2019",AB,1.0,,This machine has never worked to it’s full capacity. The water canister does not empty completely and it does not stay hot. I have not had it a full three months.
"March 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"If I had done more research before buying this product I would have purchased something else. It is not easy to clean, use, and it leaks from the first use."
"April 13, 2021",Sharon Oliveria,5.0,,"I searched & searched to find one like my old  one $200  this one is even better easier  to use, & clean I  LOVE IT !  (Oh &  so much easier on the budget )"
"November 10, 2015",Suzi,5.0,One,Works well and is very convenient. I like not having a carafe. It also can take a taller mug.
"December 29, 2017",Kathy A,4.0,,I love this coffee maker. It is so quite. The only thing that I don't like is the brightness of the clock. I have to put a towel over this coffee maker at night.
"December 13, 2013",Don Shipp,3.0,One,"This is the third brewmaster that we have owned.  The one before this one was the best.  There are several things about this one that we do not like, i.e. for the number of cups you want you must over fill( fill to 12 cup and get 10-101/2 cups); difficult to add extra water after brewing.  These are just a couple of the reasons for the rating."
"July 10, 2021",Breeanna,1.0,,"Works good, but if you set the delay brew, the water leaks all over the counter after 20 mins. Will be returning."
"October 8, 2015",Terry,5.0,,Can only buy this online. Departnent stores have the display but never have any in stock. I love this coffee system - no carafes & no little packets to fill up the landfills
"March 10, 2021",Liz,5.0,,Bella cafetera con hermoso diseño y fácil de usar
"August 15, 2016",CLC,1.0,,NOT easy to clean or maintain. Feels cheap and mine leaked. I threw it away as I didn't feel the need to subject anyone else to this complete crap.
"January 15, 2018",Matthew Easterbrook,2.0,One,If you like hot coffee don't buy this as every cup goes into the microwave from the brew station.  I have a Hamilton Beach drip coffee maker that I love.  This thing is cheaply made junk and will end up being donated.  Not the Christmas gift I was hoping it would be.
"January 5, 2016",Shawn W.,2.0,,We have had for about a year now and nearly everything on it is breaking. It consistently malfunctions.  It is also very difficult to keep clean.  The dispenser stopped working a while back and now dribbles coffee all over the counter.  Though one great thing is that it does not burn coffee as advertised.  Stick with a traditional coffee maker.
"July 6, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,This is the 2nd one we've had - this one barely lasted a year.  We make 1 pot most days and now it leaks from the bottom and doesn't even make the full pot.
"March 6, 2016",Adam L.,4.0,,"Great coffeemaker, easy to clean and use. I use if everyday for single cup serving after tiring of the reusable k cups just don't give a good cup. Got it for $30, so pretty good overall value"
"February 17, 2017",Gerard J. Keim,5.0,,"Works extremely well! Good hot cup of coffee! The one negative could be when you are filling it with water, however not for us. We place the pot near to the sink and fill it to the desired amount with the water dispenser which stretches to just the right length into the pot to avoid any spillage."
"June 25, 2021",Betsy Rall,5.0,,"We like how this dispenses coffee. Improvements from the previous model include the ability to fill a travel mug, easier water filling and easier cleaning."
"May 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love this coffee pot! Its easy to use and program. Coffee stays hot for up to 4 hours (longer still after its off) but doesn't get bitter or burnt tasting.
"September 7, 2017",Alan Host,5.0,,I have been looking for this unit for a long time and it came as promised and works great !!
"May 21, 2021",Lynn,5.0,,Works great. will buy from them again
"December 6, 2020",Joe Petix,3.0,,Why do all your coffee makers leak???
"March 25, 2021",TJC,2.0,,Product is for personal use at home and is used everyday. It's not as good as the initial Hamilton Beach that I had purchased.
"July 10, 2011",nallen@seidata.com,5.0,,"I had an earlier model Brewstation that finally gave its all and was really my favorite coffee maker till I got this one.  I was a bit hesitant because of some of the reviews saying it was leaking down the back and that the coffee spilled because the nozzle was to far back.  Yes it can spill down the back....if you over fill it and the nozzle could be a bit more to the front but the poor reviews sound more like someone trying to get a free coffee maker than the reality of the best coffee maker out there today. On my farm the coffee pot runs 24 / 7 for 365 days a year.  This works and is the one to buy!  No down side just good easy to pour, always hot, good coffee."
"July 16, 2020",George,1.0,,I love the idea of this product but they’re unable to make coffee without multiple drips through out the maker I’ve owned 2 of these and have finally given up on this and gone back to old school carafe maker
"April 13, 2016",Michelle,5.0,,This coffee maker is easy to use and clean. It's absolutely perfect. I love that I can have a cup of coffee without waiting for the whole thing to brew. I also love that I'm not creating a bunch of waste with those little cups. :)
"June 10, 2016",Jessica H,5.0,,Pretty sweet little coffee maker. I can't tell you how many coffee pots I've broken; it's nice that this one isn't glass and pretty simple to use.
"February 26, 2020",Stephen Krogulski,2.0,,"Not the worst coffee maker ever, wait yes it was"
"February 25, 2013",k9clipperlady,1.0,,"Ordered this coffee maker on Jan 7/13. Got it about the 14th of Jan.  It is now Feb 25th, and it is totally fried.  It is completely dead.  I have been looking at how I can return it or even try to get a replacement, but Amazon says its over 30 days, so I am Sh-t out of luck.  Order from Walmart.  At least they would let you return it."
"March 26, 2016",BILLY.BUMBLER,5.0,,"MAKES THE BEST COFFEE... NICE AND HOT... IF YOU LIKE THE COFFEE THAT RESTAURANTS SERVE, BOLD AND HOT... YOU R GONNA LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER.."
"July 17, 2020",Cassie H,1.0,,Coffee maker dispenser does not line up and makes a huge mess. coffee spills/drips everywhere when you try to dispense. Tried to get support to no avail.
"December 19, 2011",coffeemaster,5.0,,"I ordered this item (HB48465) 3 weeks ago.  It replaced another Hamilton Beach coffee maker that was 5 years old (and still working fine).  It is super quiet.  All the features work well and the parts fit together easily.  It looks nice. It dispenses coffee with ease (unlike previous reviews have stated).  It would be nice if there was a light at the dispenser, but there's nothing that would keep it from 5/5 stars.  Best of all, the coffee taste great.  It works well having the coffee staying inside the maker until needed. And if you want a more robust cup o' joe, you can press the brew strength button for BOLD before brewing.  The standard paper cup filters work great.  EXCELLENT - Cincinnati, OH"
"July 16, 2013",Ann Gibson,4.0,,"I love not having a glass pot, but don't like the bulkiness and difficult to clean reservoir and the programming area blocks the view of your cup when it's filling so you have to move your head to a wierd angle just to make sure you don't overfill your cup. Other than that, I really like it."
"January 18, 2014",Jeff G,5.0,,"Easy to fill and clean.  The container that holds the coffee seems to be well made and sturdy.  The buttons seem to wiggle the display board when you press them, making me wonder how well it is mounted.  The height with the lid open is quite tall - might be difficult to keep under a cabinet. Love the fact that there is no glass container to break - which I seem to have no problem doing once or twice a year. Overall, well made and worth the price."
"May 13, 2020",Gem,5.0,,Definitely money well spent
"February 18, 2017",Chris D.,5.0,,"I have now bought three of these over the years and can't imagine going back to a traditional coffee maker.  For what it's worth, mine are lasting 18-24 months."
"January 4, 2013",tami connor,4.0,,I had an older model that died and so decided to go with the same brand as I really liked the old one. This model is even better. I love the fact that the dispenser is higher so you can fill a tall travel mug. I also like that I can make 12 cups instead of 10. This is worth every penny you pay for it!
"July 18, 2016",Michael A.,3.0,,We have had this product for over year and it has done a good job. However it is noisy even after the brewing is finished it continues to make noise. It is kind of alarming at first until you get used to it. Hopefully Hamilton Beach has fixed the problem by now in the new models.
"November 5, 2015",Sue,5.0,,Works very well. Coffee tastes awesome. Love to set the timer and awaken to the smell of coffee. Can set strength you desire. Stays warm and tastes good for a few hours without the scorched taste of sitting on a warming plate.
"August 7, 2019",LARRY C.,5.0,,Works wonderful
"March 2, 2021",Matthew,1.0,,It leaked out of the back
"July 5, 2021",MaryD,1.0,,"Easy to clean, but leaks badly when filling a cup.  I have never had a problem like this with any other brew system.  It makes a real mess."
"May 23, 2015",OZwife,5.0,,"2nd one purchased this year. use it in our RV. Best model yet. We have been buying these for 5 years, Old ones had history of leaking. This is great no leaks. Detachable water reservoir makes filling easier"
"July 7, 2019",Susan Colby,5.0,,Hamilton Beach made improvements to this model.
"November 2, 2019",Paula,5.0,,This is my 3rd purchase of this coffee maker.  Not sure I could ever go back to a carafe version.
"September 2, 2014",L. Scharlau,2.0,,"There are some functions that I love, but when you put your cup in and push the whole machine moves back and you have to hold it. It seems that there should be some kind of rubber stoppers underneath to keep it in place but there isn't."
"March 12, 2019",Robyn Miranda,5.0,,Really like this coffee maker. We had a Keurig but when you have a family of coffee drinkers one cup at a time is not enough. Real easy to use and clean.
"June 1, 2019",Kindle Customer,2.0,,After a few uses it doesn't make the full 12 cups of coffee. It doesn't use all the water it usually stops at 6 cups.
"August 19, 2020",turtle,5.0,,Replaced a kuerig with this machine. Great to get back to the basics. So it takes a little extra time but the taste is impeccable.
"November 6, 2019",Stephanie,5.0,,Great product
"July 26, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Coffee can stay on the warmer without getting that old coffee taste! This is my second one. The 1st lasted at least 8 years
"July 18, 2017",Valerie Jensen,1.0,,"I ordered the HAmilton Beach coffee maker with the reservoir on the side. I received one without it. Then it didn't make it 90 days in the kitchen. I am a die hard Hamilton Beach fan, I have had 3 of these over the last 18 yrs. I bought a mr coffee! I'm so disappointed that you have glommed on to the designed obsolescence mentality. I'm returning this, and asking for a full refund. Shame on you HB and Amazon. :("

"March 13, 2016",jonbo223,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker, it makes the great tasting coffee. I prefer the bold setting. I paired it with 80675 permanent filter."
"February 2, 2020",Kindle Customer,1.0,,"Love the design and concept.  So much so that I've bought this model 5 times. For myself. Everytime it broke. This time, though, it hasn't even been 2 months. Done. No more."
"January 4, 2020",Jeanette Commagere,5.0,,"When one brewed cup at a time is too slow, but you like the ability to keep your coffee hot and served one cup at a time.  This is awesome"
"May 23, 2020",Teighlor Lonning,5.0,,"Ahh I love it! I NEVER have grounds in my coffee! Filter, water tank and heater element/coffee storage comes out for easy clening!!!"
"February 27, 2021",tm,1.0,,If you dispense a cup early it’s lukewarm. The heater element is loud.
"February 20, 2014",byrdcrest,5.0,One,"I love not having a coffee pot to wash.  Plus, glass carafes easily break on the granite counter tops, and then you have to go crazy trying to locate a new glass carafe, which cost you $25-30."
"July 27, 2020",Freddie Randle,5.0,,Nice
"June 20, 2016",Ann G,4.0,One,"This replaced an earlier model which we wore out! This makes great coffee, and keeps it hot without burning it. It does a great job making just a few cups as well."
"May 29, 2019",Jonathan R Shelley,3.0,,Owned for 3 years and the most difficult part is cleaning the dispenser which has lots more small hard to scrub areas than a carafe. Now it is leaking coffee out of the bottom every day. Time for a new machine and it won't be this one.
"July 1, 2015",julie a fox,3.0,,Really like the fact that you don't have to have a carafe. This is my third one. Unfortunately the other two quit working after a year. One was the electronics that went on it. The second one the push button broke and you couldn't get the coffee out of it. My new one so far is fine. The water supply bucket on the side does not fit correctly so I am using the one from the previous maker. When it works it is great.
"August 17, 2020",Arielle Webb,5.0,,I love it
"April 9, 2016",Jeffrey Kiebler,5.0,,"We love this coffee maker.  It is everything that was advertised.  It is easy to clean and fill.  Overall, a really good product as far as design.  Others have complained that it moves around on the counter.  We notice just a little bit of movement on our granite, but not enough to cause any issues at all."
"February 21, 2021",Derek Audet,3.0,,Had this pot before and loved it. This one is noisy like its trying to boil the coffee to keep it hot. Otherwise a good buy
"February 5, 2020",Pamela thomas,5.0,,As expected. Very nice
"May 16, 2018",Steven Kowalchuk,1.0,,"Bought this in July 2017 and today May 16, 2018 and it is clogged. I clean it once a month or more if the “clean” light comes on. Very disappointed. Didn’t even last a year!!!!"
"August 10, 2016",JWMarriott,5.0,One,Bigger than I expected takes you a lot of counter space . Future brew time setting option saves me so much time and money in the morning.
"April 12, 2021",Lisa C.,5.0,,"Easy to use and clean. Makes great tasting, hot coffee. Smaller counter footprint."
"July 26, 2019",Yahya abedi,1.0,,"Mr and miss Chinese, please send your product with good materials, tank water washer leaking, broke plastic, broken door , what is this !"
"December 24, 2019",kellie,5.0,,Brews strong
"December 5, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"Works well, keeps coffee hot for 4 hours.  I was a little disappointed in overall construction.  Expected more metal than thin plastic.  Just feels and looks a little cheap.  If you can get past that you'll be pleased with performance."
"July 17, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Used it 3 time and it started to leak coffee all over my counter!! Nothing was clogged or dirty
"January 17, 2017",Teresa,4.0,,Great design.  Love the pot. Temp was only 142 degrees.  If that's hot enough for you I would most assured use it.  I ended up giving it to a friend.  Love the concept though
"August 10, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,It's made crappy they should have kept the original design when you fill your cup up at leaks. And the way you have to fill it up is not convenient the other way was better
"December 18, 2018",Jennifer Mealy,4.0,,Easy to use and to clean. Adequate settings to keep coffee warm and to brew a pot of coffee.
"January 20, 2019",Jessica & Nick Teny,5.0,,"We bought this coffee pot 4 years ago. It has been great. The dispenser is slowing down and clogging up, but after four years of working efficiently, it’s to be expected. I love that it stays on for 4 hours. I would definitely recommend this coffee pot."
"July 8, 2016",nancy edwards,5.0,One,Replacement for old coffee pot it is absolutely great make the best coffee never leaves a bad taste even when it is on for hours you can set the Timer for the number of hours you want it to stay
"June 13, 2019",Nancy M.,5.0,,This coffee maker is super easy to use.  It keeps coffee warm and fresh much longer than any other pot we have had.  Very easy to clean!
"August 12, 2019",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"The unit is not very heavy weight and seems to slide on the countertop when you push to dispense the coffee.  Other than that, so far so good."
"December 25, 2018",JAM Savage,1.0,,Terrible quality. Leaked all over the countertop. Boiled coffee in no time
"March 2, 2020",CK_Want_Fair_Deal,1.0,,Not even 3 months old. Leaks all over the place and won't turn off. Have to unplug after brew.
"October 17, 2017",Richardson,5.0,,I bought this to replace my old one just like it.  (wore that one out)  It works great!!
"April 30, 2019",Long Dong Silver,1.0,,Leaks after a month..
"February 7, 2016",Steve,5.0,,i've used this caffeine delivery system for about two years and i am well pleased. my only objection is that it doesn't come with an intravenous attachment.
"May 13, 2017",R. Cameron,5.0,,We are Hamilton Beach consumers.  This is a replacement one.  It is great.
"July 27, 2018",Rodney W.,5.0,,"This is really nice, clean, and simple to use. It is just so much neater and cleaner!"
"December 27, 2016",Carri Thorpe,5.0,One,Don't think I'll buy a coffee pot again!
"December 16, 2020",angela barton,1.0,,I have owned many of these coffee pots and love them this one was awful. Every time you made coffee it leaked all over the counter I had to return it
"June 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,I tried one hour to make a cup of Coffee unfortunately I couldn't make my morning Coffee. I wasted four bottles of water. So I am returning it. Sorry.
"December 27, 2015",Mark in FL,5.0,,This is my second Hamilton Beach 12 Cup brewer. I had the other for several years. For me these are the gold standard of coffee makers. As long as they make them - this will be my coffee maker.
"February 24, 2018",Smiling Amazonian,5.0,,"It is safe for the elderly, without a glass carafe. I also love the huge container with an option to make ice-cold coffee. Detachable water container that can be easily washed, is an added bonus."
"June 7, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Really love this coffee maker.  Usually like a pot but this is like having a commercial maker in my kitchen and keeps coffee hot and fresh for 4 hours.  I have k-cup too but I like this better for topping off my cup.
"February 13, 2020",Bela,5.0,,"great pot of coffee, can even make ice brew"
"January 16, 2020",Kim Wilson,5.0,,I bought this coffee maker for our RV. I love it!! I will be buying another one for my house.
"January 6, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I had to buy a new one as I had the previous one so long.  Love it!
"October 18, 2014",Karl,5.0,,"Second one we bought.  Used every day.  Keeps coffee hot without burning it. This model is an improvement on the previous ones with several features such as 2 clear windows into the pot, better electronics, and fill graduations so I can use a spray nozzle to fill it to the amount I want."
"January 26, 2020",Jaime Schafer,4.0,,My only complaint is that the coffee isn't very hot.  If day like warm at best so I'm disappointed for that reason.
"December 4, 2017",kevin roth,2.0,,The machine worked well for 1 year.  After the first year it started to leak brewed coffee into the from the water reservoir. Now it leaks both internally and out of the spout to get coffee and is worthless.
"May 15, 2020",Nolan Gaskill,2.0,,Shipped with 2 of the plastic clips for the reservoir broken. While it still works this makes it inconvenient to handle.
"October 10, 2019",MLS Andrews,5.0,,"It makes it so much easier because I don't have to lift the carafe, just hold the cup against the bar. Great for seniors, especially for those of us who have arthritis."
"February 27, 2019",Mary Thompson,5.0,,There is nothing I dislike about this coffee pot!
"May 28, 2015",Justin81,5.0,,"I have owned two previous models of this coffee maker and I am just as pleased with this one. It preforms as expected and is easy to use.  However, I did notice this model does not use a water filter like the older models."
"December 29, 2014",Amber H,2.0,,"While it is easy and convenient, I could never get it to give me a HOT cup of coffee.  I was consistently having to microwave my coffee...and that was immediately after brewing.  If you like your coffee hot, I suggest something else.  I've already moved on."
"October 3, 2016",🎄 GrandpaJake 🎄,2.0,,"was disappointed with how it worked and had to return it.  Very difficult to fill with water and made a bit of a mess each time.  Our old Hamilton Beach worked great, but not so much with this one"
"January 16, 2016",Vince,5.0,4,I bought this coffee maker about 6 months ago. I've used it fairly regularly (everyday to every other) and have had no problems with it. I needed a coffee maker with an internal heat source due to my living situation. If you are brewing twelve cups the coffee may take around 6 - 10 minutes to brew all the way through. This coffee maker also has a 1-4 cup setting to keep a good flavor rather than diluted. The machine is easy to deep clean in terms of taking it apart and running vinegar through the machine. Overall the machine is great and I have recommended it/ gave it as a present. It has met my expectations with capacity and temperature. I hope this review has helped!
"August 19, 2020",Ross Bowler,2.0,,It leaks out of the dispensing spigot and trickles coffee down the side of the machine. What a mess.
"December 6, 2019",Wanda Wilson,5.0,,I love this coffee maker. It keeps my coffee hot for 4 hours and it still tastes great!
"April 23, 2020",Bethany,5.0,,Way better flavor than the pot I had. Love the options and easy to use. My grandpa figured it out by himself and he uses a flip phone
"January 3, 2019",Jess,5.0,,I LOVE THIS!!! Having a coffee dispenser is wonderful for me.
"May 11, 2020",Jennifer D.,5.0,,Absolutely a great coffee maker.  Keeps coffee HOT HOT for four hours
"March 4, 2016",Rebecca Boetto /Barry Boetto,3.0,One,It is ok as long as you drink the coffee soon after brewing.  My main problem with the coffeemaker is that the warming unit is so hot that my coffee is boiling in the coffee tank.  Makes for an unpleasant second cup
"December 20, 2019",Lucille Cameron,5.0,,I drink coffee throughout the day and this kind ofcoffee maker (without the carafe) keeps my coffee hot and is just as fresh to drink the next day.
"March 20, 2018",Taterbug,5.0,,"Worked better than expected, I use it to make coffee, tea, heat water for instant soups & hot chocolate packets"
"August 30, 2016",David J Babica,2.0,,"Lasted less than a year before it malfunctioned and stopped brewing. After the first month the ""clean"" alert came on so we cleaned but it never went off. Wanted to like it because of the lack of carafe, but it's a cheap piece of junk after all."
"March 14, 2018",Wil B,2.0,,"I like this style, where you push the button to get coffee, but it is a bad design. The water tank is under the coffee grounds. Coffee pieces will fall into the water tank and clog up the pump. When that happens you need to disassemble the machine and clean the pump and drip mechanism. Major pain. The tank should be on the side."
"November 9, 2019",bentley alberts,1.0,,"Does not keep coffee hot. Hard to clean, plastic is very cheap and breaks easily. Returning."
"May 29, 2018",Bruce,4.0,,This is our third one in 12 years. We've broken off and tried others but end up coming back for it's convenience .
"April 12, 2017",tommyp,4.0,,Takes a little to get comfortable with it but it works well and seems to be good quality.
"August 24, 2020",Cabanne Howard,1.0,,"Product worked for seven months, the slowly started leaking out of the bottom - now leaks large coffee puddles that drain off my countertop.  Only used 3x per week."
"September 7, 2014",Becky Clark,1.0,2,"This is our third Hamilton Beach brew station.  First one lasted 5+ years.  Second one maybe 2 years (we didn't have a water softener at the time, so figured that was the problem).  Our third one we just bought June 27th and it is leaking yet again!  Pools of water.  Very disappointed!  Definitely will not be buying another Hamilton Beach product.  Apparently they are using cheaper materials or something!"
"May 16, 2015",Lany Sullivan,5.0,,"I was looking at a more expensive brand with the same functions, but decided to try out this one. I love it. Easy to use, easy to program and easy to clean."
"February 7, 2014",happy shopper,2.0,,I have  had 3 brewstation coffeemakers that were Hamilton Beach & loved them.  This one was so unhandy that I don't use it.  The water reservoir is very unhandy to use.  If you wanted to make another pot you have to take the hot pot on the top off to put water in the bottom & you could burn yourself easily.  They had a good design & then this one is not so good.
"November 3, 2019",Robert M. Carlo,5.0,,I brew coffee 4 to 6 hrs almost everyday..... This is my second Hamilton Beach (just got it) and expect as many years of use as the last one.
"December 29, 2020",Bridgett,5.0,,We have had this since 2017 and no problems with leaking like we did with an expensive Cuisinart drip machine. Keeps it hot and brews fast for us.
"March 19, 2021",Linda Calisto,2.0,,"The drip tray does not work well. When cleaning the pot and removing the drip tray, coffee pours out of bottom all over the counter.  Frustrating!"
"March 29, 2021",Jennifer mcguire,1.0,,"Leaks from the top, bottom, back, and button in the front used to to dispense coffee. Cumbersome to fill with water, extremely difficult to clean."
"February 6, 2016",Linda R. Mathon,5.0,,"Outstanding. Compared to my ridiculously priced Cuisinart, this baby runs circles around the nuisance of the Cuisinart."
"August 26, 2014",P. Roberts,4.0,,"The only reason this coffee station did not get 5 stars, is the amount of noise this machine makes as long as it is turned on.  I don't like hearing the heater running the whole time.  Needs a muffler.  I am not a morning person."
"August 12, 2020",Safari Larry,5.0,,push buttom for dispensing coffee is bad. 4th day it broke. Really need LED light to see coffee as it is dispensed.
"September 15, 2011",derrydeb,4.0,5,"I got my Brewstation today.  It's so easy to use and the coffee is delicious.  I don't understand why some people can't dispense their coffee without spills.  I tried different types of cups and had no problems dispensing the coffee.  I also find that when I use the Bold setting I don't need to use as much coffee as I did with my old coffee pot to get a good strong pot of delicious coffee. I would have given 5 stars if it came with the permanent filter and scoop, but I'll get by without them.  There's no way I'm spending 11 dollars for a permanent coffee filter."
"January 20, 2019",Ken R,5.0,,"Everything is good, there was a piece of strapping that have WIFE a hard time till she looked at cleaning instructions."
"January 26, 2018",Val Fox,5.0,,WoW! Great cup of coffee and cheap too!!!
"July 7, 2019",Amanda B. Kinniburgh,5.0,,"Easy to use- settings for brew time, etc. Exactly what I was looking for. Stays piping hot for as long as you desire."
"December 1, 2014",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,This brew station was really good for the first month but now it leaks whenever I make more than 6 cups of coffee. I had a brew station before and replaced it with this one. My first one just got old and didn't keep the coffee warm anymore but it never leaked like this one.  Guess I need to contact Hamilton Beach.
"July 30, 2020",Kindle Customer,2.0,,"It leaks terribly. Always a puddle under the machine. need bleach and water to remove coffee stains from my counter. otherwise makes great coffee, easy to clean and use."
"January 20, 2020",Erin,5.0,,Very easy to use and clean out. Keeps coffee warm but automatically turns off after set amount of time. Love it!
"May 18, 2015",JKITTY,3.0,,"The first one I received was damaged in shipment and Amazon replaced it quickly.  5 Stars to Amazon.  The coffee maker itself is not as good as my original one, but it is easier to fill.  The water receptacle does not fit tight against the body and it continues to gurgle long after the coffee is made.  The quality does seem to have slipped."
"November 9, 2020",Kathleen Flynn-Quinn,1.0,,Coffee machine worked good at first 7 months later it’s leaking and not sucking the water up to make the coffee what can I do to have it replaced
"November 26, 2019",Pat Larocca,2.0,,This coffee maker makes a lot of noise and I don't recommend it.  After it has brewed it still is making noise until you shut it off for the day.
"March 7, 2019",Jesus M Cabarrus,2.0,One,"Coffee made is decent, but it's annoying to fill and clean, and always leaks coffee from the bottom of the machine - have not been able to figure out why!  Just stick with the typical drip maker."
"January 14, 2018",bearsma88,1.0,,I was disappointed for the first time with Hamilton Beach. This was the worst coffee pot I ever bought. It never fit right and leaked. I ended up throwing it away.
"October 2, 2019",denise davenport,2.0,,I had one of the same model. Replaced it with a new one. It makes noise from the heating plate. Loud noise. It gets very hot to touch. Disapointed
"May 23, 2019",vanessa,1.0,,"What a mess. The coffee tastes bad, hard to measure. Overall what terrible purchase"
"March 30, 2021",Brad,1.0,,I loved the coffee maker until it started leaking. It worked great for about a year and then it started leaking one day and had to throw it away
"October 2, 2019",Chelsea,1.0,,I like the style.  But my coffee is burning every time I brew 😞 it smells horrible and taste disgusting . I am having to use my old coffee pot.
"November 25, 2019",Melissa Bullock,1.0,,"Horrible product, hasn’t even been 2 months and already leaking all over the place and can’t return.  Would not recommend this product to anyone"
"July 12, 2016",Willie D,5.0,One,"This is our 2nd Brewstation and are very happy with it.  Our previous one lasted over 5 years and probably due to daily use over that time, a plastic piece in the dispensing area broke.  It was more cost effective to purchase a new one."
"May 6, 2016",Pam S.,1.0,,"Loved the way it worked, but it stopped working after 59 days of use.  I made 1 to 2 pots per day and cleaned it twice in those 59 days."
"November 6, 2011",Furbaby Dad,5.0,,"Purchased this as a supplement to my daily user the Hamilton Beach 4 cup brewer. On weekends more people are in the house and it's nice having a larger coffee brewer. It's just like the smaller one, only larger. Both are excellent coffee brewers and other brands just don't compare, period."
"May 26, 2019",John R. Marshall,5.0,,This is my third unit over the years. I like the new changes made to the coffee maker. I would highly recommend it.
"April 27, 2021",Kindle Customer,3.0,,"I have had one of these coffee makers for years, this is my third one, but this one leaks all the time! I do not know what to do?"
"November 2, 2015",G. Gould,5.0,,There is usually only 1 coffee drinker in the house.  I refuse to buy the kind of maker with the little individual packs.  So much unnecessary garbage.  This product is perfect for me and when I get company I can make a full pot.
"March 2, 2016",P. Williams,4.0,,"OK, this pot is pretty cool, I will admit it. There are some advantages to having a system like this and many of their marketing materials are spot on. That being the case, I will list some things those materials didn't cover. One, the basket size, though standard with paper filters, was to low for the baskets I had used with other pots that used the bigger, non-cone filters. No bid deal, I use the paper anyway. Also, this pot does make a good tasting pot of coffee. The one thing I would say is that is does have a carafe, it's just built in and not glass. Also, this isn't that easy to clean - where a normal glass carafe is smooth and edge free, the inside of this has a lot of edges and nooks and crannys that make cleaning it a bit more difficult. It is easy to use and the price was really good. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. I do hope it lasts - I am not that confident though, given how cheaply made coffee makers are now."
"February 12, 2014",Adam S,5.0,,"After reading several of the reviews I decided to take the chance and get it. I have had no issues at all with it not warming the coffee, in fact, it comes out quite hot! It looks good, and does exactly what it's supposed to. For what we were looking for, couldn't be happier."
"May 9, 2017",Becca,5.0,,Loving it so far. Had it for a couple weeks. No issue. Love not having the carafe. Easy to fill and use.
"June 2, 2020",Clg,1.0,,This might be the worst coffee pot ever! Takes forever to brew the coffee taste burnt. Maybe because it takes so long to brew. I would not recommend.
"March 13, 2017",Amazon Customer,1.0,3,I had this coffee maker for only two months and it just quit working. And Hamilton Beach charges $11 plus change to ship a replacement!! Really? Their defective product and I have to pay for them to replace it after two months..... Very disappointing.
"October 7, 2019",Barbara coovert,5.0,,Easy to use and love the hands free push button with your cup....no carafe to clean.  Had same one previously.  Only issue did not last lon maybe two years.
"January 21, 2019",g.t.b.,5.0,,great my second one first one lasted 5 years.
"April 11, 2013",ksutherly1959,3.0,One,"I really like the side port for filling the coffee maker. No water spills. I don't feel that it holds 12cups of coffee. I keep running short. It's also doesn't seem to keep the coffee real hot. I probably would buy another one, because I do like the side port fill."
"November 28, 2017",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker, I have had it for 2 months now and it is working great."
"January 14, 2020",shayne fugate,1.0,,this coffee pot leaks...out of the box and cant even use it without making a big mess...don't buy it
"November 19, 2017",dental nerd,4.0,,good coffee maker...if you need a lot or have a party you wil lneed a carft . Only makes 10 cups
"September 26, 2019",Angela C.,5.0,,I loved my new coffee maker! It’s easy to use and coffee comes out great!
"August 16, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I am very happy with this coffee maker. I have been using a pour over for years but wanted something that makes equally great tasting coffee but more than one cup at once. The Brewstation is very easy to use and I like that it doesn't have a carafe. The coffee tastes great and the holding tank keeps it nice and hot. Would highly recommend!
"March 15, 2011",Paying Attention,5.0,One,"I ordered this one with some trepidation because of negative reviews, but have no complaints so far.  The process is different, but the results are excellent.  I  love the ease of filling both my somewhat tall travel cup and my husband's very thick mug.  Coffee is hot and delicious.  Clean up is easy."
"July 4, 2016",WILLIAM R DELL,4.0,,"I have used it a couple months now, and I really like it! It took some time to get the coffee to water ratio just right but now it's perfect. The only drawback is not being able to see the coffee as it goes in to the cup, so you don't know when it's full. Minor inconvenience."
"November 17, 2013",Cee,5.0,,"Better than expected, I only wish I had found this coffee maker prior. You can select up to 4 hours of heating. Just place your cup into the maker and off you go. I highly recommend this. The quality is also better than expected. So far, so good."
"April 6, 2019",Bo Spencer,5.0,,Great buy for the money
"November 8, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"It has no carafe and I like that, easy cleaning and keeps the coffee nice and hot for up to 3 hours"
"March 3, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Dislike-leaked, returned"
"May 8, 2017",ABorgDrone,5.0,One,"This is a great coffee maker.  I have two of them; one for my cabin and one for my house.  There are reviews of this with reports of leaking however I don't have issues with either of mine.  Overall an easy to use coffee maker, that well.... makes a great cup of coffee."
"January 27, 2020",Jeff,4.0,,It works and it’s not to messy.
"May 21, 2019",Shannon,5.0,,Far better than a regular coffee pot or a Keurig! Coffee & tea stay perfect fresh the entire time you keep it warm.
"January 13, 2021",Grandma,1.0,,It leaks all over the counter. I have a mess everyday. Bringing my old one back in. Leaks after you turn it off.
"January 9, 2018",ove,1.0,,"Worked well for a while. Now every time I make coffee no matter how many cups, it leaks everywhere on the counter. Read and trust the reviews. Do not buy this product. I'll be going back to a simple coffee maker."
"September 19, 2014",Walter Sobchak,5.0,One,"works great, easy to clean. I wasn't sure if I'd like not having a pot, but it is actually much more convinient. I also really like being able to change the setting on how long it stays on for."
"October 30, 2013",chilltampa,5.0,,We've owned two previous models and always liked them a lot because you can fit tall to go containers under the spout without doubt coffee down the side because you don't have to angle the cup to get at the spout. The only issue we had with the previous model was that it had a small opening to poor water into. This model fixed that issue. I absolutely love it. And I don't know what they could do to make a better coffee maker! It's perfect.
"June 22, 2016",Jim Prince,5.0,One,This is a very nice product.  I especially like the fact that I can easily fill my travel mug.  This model can also be programmed to stay on for 4 hours.
"May 17, 2021",katelyn,1.0,,Will not buy again. Leaks really bad from the bottom.of the coffeemaker
"March 13, 2019",GA Girl,5.0,,We prefer drip coffee makers and this suits us well. Hamilton Beach is a good quality product. This is my second purchase and will continue to purchase this one as long as it’s available.
"July 17, 2021",Composting Mom,5.0,,Easy to use and makes good coffee.
"June 4, 2013",353pir,5.0,12,This coffeepot has been great and looks good too! The coffeemaker has features I didn't realize like a bold setting which we use and so you do not need as much coffee to make it just a s strong! The seller was prompt and item was received quick! Thanks!
"August 8, 2020",Elodia Heredia,3.0,,Leaks badly from the “ drip pipe” around the mug when in use. I got this as a replacement to the older model I’d had for about three years.... which honestly caused no leakage.
"August 19, 2015",KristyH,5.0,,"I love my Brewstation!  The programming features are very easy to use and the lack of a burner keeps the coffee from becoming ""old tasting"" even after a few hours of being brewed."
"July 12, 2015",popcornfanatic,2.0,,"I only buy Hamilton Beach toasters small appliances because they last. I've bought 2 regular BrewMasters and they've each lasted 2 years. This one I bought as a back up and because of a great price at the time. Its been i storage since May. I began using it 3 days ago and it has leaked brewed coffee at the bottom each day. (That's the problem I have with Mr. Coffee brewers, actually). I should have been smarter and did a trial run when it came in and also bought the 2- year warranty. I do believe there is a lemon in every category and I may have just gotten a bad one. M y deal wasn't a deal due to my thriftiness and so I've learned a lesson. So, I have again bought a regular Brew Master and included a 3 year warranty for $3. BTW: Another brand Ive had good luck with is Black & Decker."
"July 25, 2019",Adam W.,5.0,,Best coffee maker I’ve ever had. I just bought a 2nd one for my Dad !!! Can’t wait to give it to him
"January 4, 2019",Crystal Strickland,5.0,,This thing is awesome. I haven't had any problems. Love waking up to fresh coffee every morning.
"January 29, 2011",DTobin,5.0,,I am so thankful for reviews on a product.  I read the reviews and that is why I purchased this particular coffee maker.  It was a replacement of another Hamilton Beach.  The selling point was the reservoir to hold the hot coffee instead of a burner to keep it hot.  The coffee tastes the same whether it is just brewed or sits for 3 hours.  Mucho Good!
"June 7, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Love this product...set it the night before and ready for AM coffee.  Settings for keeping warm for hours, big enough to put a thermos under to fill.  Best coffee maker I have owned."
"April 14, 2021",patrick,1.0,,It drips down the back when filling coffee cup. stained my counter top. We bought 3 of them in two years and the same result.
"February 6, 2019",Sonja,5.0,,Best coffee maker
"November 22, 2018",david ronquillo,1.0,,Received item November 7.  Started leaking today.  Per instruction in care and cleaning - still leaking - will contact support and keep you posted on customer service.
"May 22, 2019",Betty,5.0,,I love the brew station.  No carafe to deal with.  I have one in the house and one in the camper.
"April 5, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love it!!!
"July 2, 2015",nolapenguin,5.0,,"This is a fabulous coffee maker. The iced coffee function really comes in handy for the summer months. It's very easy to fill, very easy to clean, and the dispenser has enough clearance to allow the tallest of travel cups to fill up."
"September 14, 2020",lbruce@somtel.com,3.0,,"I love the design and capabilities, but the thing leaks and I can't figure out why."
"June 19, 2019",Charlotte H.,5.0,,I have bought 4 of these. Really like them join
"June 11, 2018",Skid the kid,2.0,,"did not see where i was not going to get a carafe, when brewing, hot area looks like its going to burn, they tried to make it like a kurig"
"July 7, 2019",Karen K McKinnon,5.0,,love it
"December 15, 2013",mamawfaith,5.0,,"I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't love this Brewstation. I set it to brew the night before and wake up to a wonderful aroma. I had read some negative reviews but decided to try it anyway. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and have had no problems at all with the dispenser. I set mine to the bold flavor and it is just right for me. Very nice and sturdy, a great product from Hamilton Beach!"
"June 2, 2013",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I orginally bought the BrewStation because my husband always broke the glass carafs. Now with the new feature of not having to pour water, I have alot less mess. No more of my husband saying the coffee pot is broken because he poured the water in wrong. I still have the orginal brewstation put away for when I have company and 2 pots of coffee brewing."
"August 28, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"This coffee maker was at first a little difficult to figure it out, then we realized that the water goes in the bottom of the compartment, which then fills up the compartment because we were wondering why it wasn't working. It's a great compact coffee maker without the spills or the mess. Only had it for about a week, and it is worth purchasing.  I would give it 5 stars for the coffee maker, should have a sticker that says fill water her in the bottom of the coffee maker."
"March 4, 2020",Barbara Orfield,5.0,,"It takes a few times making  coffee to get the taste right. I found out to get six cups of coffee, you need  eight  cups  of water"
"October 30, 2019",TX girl,2.0,,Would have returned it if my husband didn't throw away the box. Is not a true 12 cup coffee pot.
"January 30, 2020",Jeff,1.0,,Not very good wastes slots of coffee and has issues already with brewing a whole pot. Not satisfied at all do not recommend .
"January 8, 2020",Beau Boughfman,3.0,,"Like this machine, but the top lid was broken off when I received it. I will say the machine has a relatively loud fan noise when it's on."
"March 9, 2020",matt parkhurst,5.0,,"Likes include no coffee pot to clean, easy dispensing of coffee, easy programming."
"December 10, 2014",Johnny Vintage,4.0,One,"Good coffee. You do have to let the coffee sit a bit to get hot as it goes into a reservoir with a heating element once it goes through the filter. DANGER WILL ROBINSON****DANGER!!! For some reason, when you take the reservoir out to clean, there is a fair amount of water sitting in the bottom of the coffee maker.  I lifted up the coffee maker and poured the water into the sink only to find that the water runs right over top of the electronic control panel. KABLAM!!!  Unit is dead and the only thing that shows up on the once pretty blue display is the trouble code F06. Got our hair dryer out and blew hot air on the display for a few ours.  Over the next few days, the display came back but it's not as bright as it was before."
"December 15, 2018",Tishelle Ward,1.0,,I love the ease of this coffee maker but it is progressively getting worse and leaking all over my kitchen counters!  Not sure what to do since there is only a two week turn around time for returning?
"April 10, 2017",Prof,3.0,,Water reservoir doesn't sit straight on to the body.  Is poorly enigeneered.  However works quite well
"March 19, 2021",Raul H.,5.0,,"Love the new design, very easy to clean and set up to be ready for future brewing. Keeps coffee extremely hot"
"March 18, 2014",Dennis H,1.0,,"We have had a Hamilton Beach BrewStation for years and loved it.  But, this new ""improved"" version is a major step in the wrong direction.  For whatever reason, they removed the pour spout from the tank so that you cannot easily transfer coffee to a thermos or hot pot.  The removable reservoir is a nice feature that we never use.  And the brilliant LED display lights up the entire kitchen at night.  Last BrewStation for us!"
"December 24, 2015",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"We bought this to replace the exact model. This one, however, tends to burn the coffee. So long as we drink the pot fast it's perfect but to let it sit for more than an hour the hot plate is too hot."
"January 4, 2020",Daysha C. Downing,3.0,,The machine is ok. I don’t like how hard I have to punch my mug to the back for coffee to be dispensed.
"July 28, 2014",macrorw,5.0,,We have had several versions of this coffee maker and this is by far the best.  We drink a lot of coffee around our house and are really rough on these makers!  The new design is the most user friendly yet.  I love that all of the pieces come out and you can wash them all.  This new design with the removable water reservoir is the best!  Excellent new design.  Very happy with my purchase!
"October 18, 2019",Rebecca K,4.0,,"The coffee pot works well, but when on it is constantly making noise"
"January 1, 2020",Lauren Alston,5.0,,The best feature is the dispenser button. There’s a second filter so no more stupid coffee grounds no matter what. Our greatest buy yet.
"July 7, 2019",Carl Miller,5.0,,Works great
"August 4, 2017",jules,5.0,One,"Just what I wanted.  Works great.  My favorite coffee maker.  Have been using this type of coffee maker for 15 years!  They keep updating them, which is great!"
"January 16, 2018",TraceyB,3.0,,Mine started to leak after only a few months. We have to empty out the coffee pot after finishing last cup.
"March 8, 2020",RoushRS,5.0,,Great coffee maker.  Does not take up a lot of counter space.  Like not having a glass carafe.
"December 7, 2016",L. Musson,5.0,,"I had the 4 cup version and loved it, will only get this type from now on, no pot to clean and takes less than 2 minutes to prep for the next day. Love it ! love it!  love it!"
"September 8, 2015",Shepherdess@ATX,2.0,,"Takes 15min to brew 8 cups.  Programming is either broken on mine or not user friendly (I am tech savvy). Returning it.  I do like the idea of no carafe and it doesnt burn the coffee, but for $50, i can do better."
"April 10, 2018",David C.,3.0,,We have had this coffee maker for two plus years now. The component that allows coffee out of the reservoir began to leak a few months ago. We had to keep a cup underneath it to catch drips. Then the mechanism just stopped working. Pushing the pedal doesn’t work to let coffee pour out into your cup.
"January 7, 2017",Nelson I 've been having truble with this app for about 2wks It wont load and I uave to reinstall it,5.0,,has met all my expectations.  I really like the fact that it has a separate container for the water and that you can set it to keep your coffee warm for a certain amount of time.
"November 5, 2019",Stephani Parsons,5.0,,Absolutely love this coffee machine. Super easy to clean and setup.
"February 18, 2021",Linda A Meloro,1.0,,Purchased two months ago and the water tank is already leaking.  Tried to contact the company for repair or replacement but no response.
"March 6, 2020",iris serrano,2.0,,"While maker cover, they cam back for  cup of coffee and there was a mess of coffee all over the counter, cabinets & floor. Defected"
"December 23, 2015",Heather Kruszewski,5.0,,I got this a year ago and it's still working perfectly. This is super simple and I don't have to worry about a glass pot!
"December 30, 2019",Shauna Esposito,5.0,,"This is a fabulous coffee maker.  It is super easy to use, clean and we love it!"
"March 24, 2012",Bridget,2.0,One,"I spent hours looking at reviews, product descriptions and in stores.  I originally bought a different coffee maker than this one but sent it back because it was very small for travel mugs.  This Hamilton Beach is deceptive, especially due to the stock picture (which shows a man holding a travel mug under the drip spot).  It can only fit smaller plastic travel mugs under (not any normal standard kind of travel mug that you buy, I have tried all of mine in various sizes)--inconvenient for my needs.  I also didn't understand that the ""scoop"" was supposed to save you a step of putting coffee in the machine--but it is messy and again inconvenient.  The scoop has to be rinsed out frequently and grounds stay in the filter underneath--which needs cleaning often.  It doesn't hold a lot of water to make a full 14 oz cup either.  If you overfill the water it spills out of the back.  I wish I kept the packaging for me to send it back too. I will continue to look for a model that fits travel mugs.  Incidentally, I have used Hamilton Beach Stay or Go models and was very happy--which came with/used the travel mug in the picture (part of why I bought it) but again--wont fit."
"September 30, 2017",Kristin D,5.0,,"We were going through several k-cups a day, so in an effort to save some money, we decided to purchase a traditional coffee maker. We've had this machine for about a year now and we love it. It works great, it's easy to use, it doesn't take up a ton of space, and I'm not forced to constantly be washing a crusty carafe. Definitely recommended!"
"December 22, 2016",courtney skinner,4.0,,"Great coffee maker once you learn how its all put together and how it works. Not having to deal with a glass pot is great, and is safer."
"October 11, 2018",Rob Perez,5.0,,This was great when we first got it but after two years coffee is now spilling out from the back.
"May 19, 2018",Michael,5.0,,This works great and gets me the coffee right now.  I like to wake up to the smell when I preset it!
"July 15, 2019",A.J.S.,4.0,,I wish I bought 14 cups.  It seems to run out of coffee quickly.  If like coffee as much as I do buy the bigger one.
"July 16, 2016",Nancy Taylor,1.0,,I loved this the fiery 3 times used then it started leaking . NO WOULD NEVER EVER BUY. And of course to late to return
"January 25, 2018",Trent A.,5.0,,"Love this thing! Just a side note, the blue light for the display is surprisingly bright. Super easy to fill and take apart to clean."
"August 23, 2016",Tokyobound,4.0,,"I would give 5 stars, but I feel like if the manufacture invested led light it would make it easier for the user to see the volume of Coffee being poured especially for thermoses."
"July 14, 2021",jesse A Vowell,5.0,,Great coffee maker
"January 6, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"This was working fine for a month , but now the brewed coffee is not hot. I purchased it based on the review , but I guess I was wrong."
"December 9, 2016",vryskeptical,4.0,,"Easy to prepare coffee.  No coffee pot to sit on the burner, so coffee does not get old.  I will purchase again."
"October 8, 2014",Al L.,5.0,,This pot was a replacement and we enjoy the control board being moved to the top of the unit rather than the old ones that were located on the side of the unit and were bearly readable.  One improvement that could be made would be to have a method where you could refill the water reserve tank without disassembling the entire unit.
"April 3, 2018",Leslie Lohmiller,1.0,,"How to sum up....terrible. Worst coffee maker I’ve ever purchased. No matter how many times I’ve cleaned it, it leaks coffee all over the counter as soon as it starts to cool down. I have to remove any coffee that’s in the reservoir once the heating element turns off. I wouldn’t recommend this product."
"January 10, 2021",Melissa Slaughter,1.0,,We had the older model of this and needed to upgrade. This one started leaking on day 2 of using it. Very disappointed.
"May 10, 2020",J. Haskell,5.0,,timer heater for 4 hours but use it for only so it doesn't taste burnt
"December 7, 2013",mom,5.0,,This product is perfect.  We love the brew station concept.  We used this about five times a week at the church building.  It is easy to use.  Adults think it is fun.  (Only one concern that the coffee does stay in a plastic container which does concern some.)
"January 3, 2014",KW,4.0,,"I have had this Brew Station for 2 years ( I've had 2 ) I bought the same one for a friend. Pros: make as many cups as you'd like set timer to be donw for when you want it made I used a paper filter ( my preference) Cons: If you have hard water,it needs cleaned more often harder to clean than any other coffee maker because of the inside water holder **When pouring the water into it to make a pot, 99% of the time for me, it drips all over the outside."
"April 7, 2021",Penny carroll,3.0,,leaked at first I had to tighten down the screws on the inside of where the coffee is kept warm once made.
"May 19, 2020",kitty,5.0,,"I had already cup could only melee one cup at a time. I love this maker, quick, tasted good, ready to use."
"November 20, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this coffee machine!  Never have to worry about breaking a carafe.  Coffee is always hot!"
"July 23, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"I do like my coffee maker, this is the 4th one I have had.  I love its features, but I liked it better when it did not have the water tank on the side, I liked it when you just filled the big tank.  this seems extra trouble, as you still have to wash the coffee tank.  the water tank is more apt to spill while transferring it to the coffee maker, but that is not Amazon's fault,  it is Hamilton Beach's.  thank you so much.  Barbara Rice"
"January 23, 2018",Emily Turner,1.0,,"I did not actually use the machine to make coffee, so I cannot comment on the quality of coffee it brews. It was not tall enough to accommodate our 16 oz travel mugs without angling them significantly. We returned it unused."
"June 13, 2017",Mary Jayne HOward,5.0,,Brother loves.
"February 25, 2021",tonybones,1.0,,The fact that i had to returned two of them for the same problem.
"April 17, 2020",Amazon Customer,4.0,,It’s alright. The lever to get the coffee isn’t very good. Easy enough to use.
"November 2, 2015",Nancy Nyikes,5.0,,This is a great coffee maker.  The flavor stays fresh far longer with this coffee maker than with typical glass carafe types.  Guests quickly figure out how to help themselves to a fresh cup which makes everyone happy.
"September 4, 2017",GirlfromIL,4.0,,It works well but filling the coffee maker with water is messy now without the reservoir.
"January 6, 2014",MissDiane,1.0,11,"I so enjoyed my old brew station but sadly this machine lacks ALL the quality of the old one.....So many bad things I can say about it.  The design leaves much to be desired..especially the holding tank.  For example, If you want to pour your leftover coffee into another container or even to dump it forget about it as there is no spout,  just multiple holes that cause the coffee to pour out in many directions.  I also found pools of coffee that apparently leaked from the holding tank into the bottom of the machine."
"December 24, 2014",Deborah E Matusek,1.0,2,I have had this product for 5 months.  It started leaking a month ago. It also does not always finish making the coffee.  I am really disappointed in this product.
"September 19, 2015",valia rasuli,4.0,,"It looks nice. Coffee is hot. Timers and keep warm are nice. My only qualm is with the shape, because it has curves, when you open the lid, it tends to drip water on the counter because the hinge area is narrower than the rest.  Also, the rubber ""feet"" tend to pop out when you move the machine."
"October 13, 2012",Hawk,5.0,,Have used Hamilton Beach an older Hamilton Beach for years before it died.  During a hurricane (New Orleans) recently we had power surges and it killed my older version.  Purchased this one and it works great.  I recommend to any one who likes coffee.
"March 18, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,The coffee boils.  The heating element gets too hot.
"September 18, 2015",Amazon Customer,2.0,,I was disappointed in the nice looking coffee maker.  The main thing is that it always leaked water coming from no place we could find.  We are putting it our garage sale tomorrow.  Sorry
"February 23, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Easy to use and easy to clean!
"April 26, 2019",Sandra jacobsen,5.0,,Perfect thank you
"August 28, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I had an older model that finally cratered.  I wanted the serve-a-cup or thermos feature and found a GAMILTOn Beach on Amazon.  It absolutely meets my expectations and is a slimmer model.  Makes an ideal cup of coffee!  No shorgcomings!!!
"August 13, 2016",IrishRose,4.0,,Keeps coffee hot for long time without that burnt taste.  Easy to use.

"January 17, 2013",~Miss~,5.0,,"I bought this as a gift for my friend and she loves it. Her and her husband drink tons of coffee and the pot just wasn't keeping everything hot. This works great and less messy than a pot. He tended to spill a lot, now that isn't the case. I would recommend this."
"March 15, 2018",BARBARA MCINTYRE,3.0,,ok
"August 21, 2015",Phil,4.0,,We enjoy it and use it often.  Make great coffee and unlike our old coffee maker it does not leak.  I would recommend this product
"January 30, 2021",Frances Draughn,1.0,,"So disappointed! I really like the self serve aspect of this product, however, it leaks behind the push button feature."
"November 9, 2014",Dawn,4.0,,"Love this coffee maker. I don't have any of the problems mentioned by the negative reviews. I have used to go mugs and regular coffee cups with no spillage issues. The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is that I have only had it a week or so, so I can't speak for durability yet."
"December 20, 2016",CS Ambrose,1.0,,"We bought this coffee maker in July and by November it wasn't working. Also, apparently, it was designed by someone who is left handed, because it indicates that you pour the water into the left side, which is awkward for right handed people. When a product doesn't work after four months it's not worth the purchase."
"January 28, 2015",geekchic78,5.0,,"Arrived on time and in new condition.  I love this Brewstation!  It fits all of my needs while at work, and it's very easy to program.  No wet spots to clean up on the table so far yet.  Overall, very happy with this item."
"December 14, 2019",Lena,5.0,,We’ve had a French press for forever but with two babies we needed a quicker option. This coffee pot is awesome. I highly recommend.
"July 14, 2016",Daniel R. Ruiz,5.0,,"was reluctant to purchase the coffee maker, but found it to be much more efficient that standard coffee makers that use the carafe. There's very little evaporation, so the amount of coffee is always exact and the internal heating element keeps the coffee hot/warm for a very long time without affecting the taste!  Love it!"
"December 17, 2012",William L. Troth,5.0,,"When I broke the last of many glass carafes I went on line to Amazon to buy a new one but when I saw this ""carafe-less"" coffe maker it seemed like a great idea since its price is equal to only about 3 carafes. It workd grea, is easy to use and clean."

Taller than I anticipated, but moving it to a different spot on the counter than where we had our previous coffee maker, now it is good. Love the removable water reservoir, makes it easy to fill without spilling water on the counter top."

"March 16, 2018",DonBon,5.0,,We met this brew station at our trip trough US and loved since first day. Back in Germany we didn't want our coffee from the old machine and so we bought this brew station.

"September 7, 2020",Donna Grendahl,1.0,,It leaks clear water. The unit is only six months old. This is the fourth coffee maker of this type that has leaked.
"February 18, 2016",Eldonsdad,4.0,,So far performing fine. Only problem is that it makes noise when just sitting there. I believe it is the heating element where the bottom part meets the top but as long as it works I'm happy.

"March 29, 2014",Avid Amazoner,2.0,,"We have had this coffee maker for 4 weeks. I just printed the label to return it. Today is the deadline for returning it so I just made it.  We have a water dispenser on our fridge and this reservoir is very difficult to fill from the fridge due to it's size and slightly curved shape.  We can only get one corner of the water tank into the water dispenser and it takes a pretty steady hand to make sure not to spill the water when it gets to the top. The 12 cup fill line is at the very top. Our #1 complaint has been discussed several times in the reviews. Once the brewing is done and the coffee is sitting in the reservoir, the ""hot plate"" in the bottom is constantly boiling the coffee slightly so it sizzles and crackles the entire time it is keeping the coffee warm/hot. It is very distracting when it quite in the house and actually loader than our dishwasher. I have seen several reviews that said the coffee did not come out hot enough. I think ours was just the opposite. Once it was brewed, it was not drinkable for several minutes until it cooled down. Great concept! We love the tank method as this is our second of this style, but they clearly (by looking at many of these reviews) do not have the temperature management worked out yet. It's either not hot enough or in our case too hot. Unfortunately, coffee needs to be brewed at one temperature, and kept warm at a different temperature. One temp for both is not working! I think we will be looking for another tank style maker but with better temperature control."
"July 20, 2013",rcwash,5.0,,"This coffee pot has met my every expectation. The only thing that I could possibly want is a light by the fill nozzle and a ""stickier"" bottom. It is hard to see when filling a large cup or mug and sometimes you have to hold the pot when filling your cup. Those are very small issues. I have a Bunn at work and I'm considering getting the Brewstation instead. I have used every type of container from a regular mug to a thermos and they all filled without one drip. I have had my pot for a few months and I have not had to clean the drip tray once. Simply great!"
"August 8, 2018",Amberly Depue,5.0,,Absolutely love this!!!!!! I love the 4 hour stay warm setting.
"June 3, 2020",Bruce G,1.0,,"I like the coffee maker, but it leaks.  When you push to dispense coffee, it does not seal properly.  Hamilton Beach sent me a whole new reservoir, but it has the same problem."
"January 18, 2017",Ezra,4.0,One,Works very well and is super easy to clean. Large capacity is also a bonus.
"March 4, 2014",Thumper,4.0,,"I finally had to discard my original Brew Station from 7 or 8 years ago.  I like this new model with the exception that the pad to push the cup to fill the cup is too high.  It is very awkward to hold the cup that high and press firmly enough to fill the cup.  Wish they still made the original model but there is always the new and improved, which often is not an improvement."
"November 5, 2016",JOSE R LOPEZ H,1.0,,"After the first month of use the dispenser started leaking, and yesterday the coffee maker just stopped working. This is my second coffee maker of this brand and both of them had the same issue with the dispenser... I don't know where to repair the first and this one I don't even know if it has a warranty or something like"
"January 19, 2017",Renee,1.0,,I've this coffeemaker in the past and I loved it. I just got my new one and it has this big gap in the top. The top doesn't fit correctly and jiggles a ton. When in use water leaks out of this gap due to the steam. I requested a replacement in hopes this was just an issue with this coffeemaker.
"July 13, 2021",Brandon W. Burgess,4.0,,I've had better and I've had worse.

"August 10, 2020",Jesus Ramirez,5.0,,Works great
"April 1, 2019",Missy and Rusty,1.0,,"We bought this one since it was Amazon's choice.  After less than 5 months it has coffee grounds overflowing from the basket to clog the dispenser.  We clean it every month with vinegar, I am not sure why this is happening."

"August 15, 2016",Virginia Lake,2.0,One,"There's a problem with the unit that keeps the coffee hot.  I can hear it slightly boiling all of the time.  I had the last one for years, and it didn't function this way.  It's still usable, so I didn't want to bother returning it.  Better luck next time?"
"February 3, 2018",BT,1.0,,"Ugly, cheap looking and slides backward when you push against the button to fill it.  Returned."
"February 17, 2019",Susan,5.0,,This coffee maker is amazing. Delicious coffee. Easy to set up and use the timer. I ADORE IT and my husband for buying it for me.
"November 29, 2015",MEM,3.0,,I have had 3 of these coffee makers and always loved them but this time I got one that has a small leak that comes out of the bottom of the machine. I can't figure out where it is coming from.

"March 18, 2016",Tom Price,5.0,,"I'm 76 and have had a lot of coffee makers in my life.  This is the best!.... Really!!  Simple,well made and very convenient.  Being xNavy I've consumed my share of coffee and this brews a good cup of coffee.. Not sure what others have to complain about but to just complain.  I would recommend this to anyone.

"March 7, 2016",kim kaye,1.0,,not very user friendly  you have to take out a water filler fill it then put it in lower filler put the other piece back then do the filter i like quick this is too much work for coffee
"July 13, 2020",Daniel W VanBoxtel,5.0,,We had bought this to go in our motor home and it works so well and is so easy to clean that I got it in the house!!
"June 29, 2017",ANGIE APPLEGATE,1.0,One,Purchased in March 2017 and just the end of June and having to purchase a new coffee maker.  I believe there is an electrical issue.  It started out making odd sounds and now turns itself on.  Need unplug machine after each use.

"December 1, 2014",Erwin,2.0,2,"Idea was nice, price was OK, but after a few months, it started leaking. Turns out it has a very bad design for the water to pass to filtration and it will cause failure eventually."
"January 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"After fist brew coffee never stayed warm, returned and ordered a kruig"
"September 4, 2014",Sadie T.,1.0,3,I returned this coffeemaker shortly after receiving it. It started leaking into the lower part of the coffeemaker right away.

"June 27, 2018",Andrew Weinberg,5.0,,"Loved it from the start. Read reviews of people complaining about leaks. Never happened. There is some condensation when you lift the lid, but if you do it properly, the water drains back in."
"March 31, 2016",Tyler Strop,4.0,,Great coffee maker the only issue i have had with i is when you reheat the coffee it doeskin taste the greatest. But then again day old coffee isnt going to taste the same..
"December 15, 2016",Debbie,5.0,,I like this coffee pot. You do not have to pour the water into the tank. The tank is removable for filling.
"January 11, 2011",Heavy Kevy,5.0,,I actually bought this for my father.  He loves it.  The only thing he complained about was the fact that after it shuts the reheat off you can't turn the reheat back on.  It wants to rebrew and won't let you without water.  I don't know if there is some way around this but I can see where this would be a problem.
"June 2, 2018",Caitlin Conklin,1.0,,Stopped working after one month. Wouldn’t even turn on. Of course AFTER the return time frame
"November 27, 2017",gumby4yoga,5.0,,I like the push for coffee feature and the space savor of the pot above instead of a dirty glass pot.
"February 12, 2014",D. Z.,5.0,One,Works good. Makes good coffee & is easy to clean with detachable water resevor which is why I bought it. Back light is easy to read & can serve as a night light if needed. I would recommend this to my friends.
"July 7, 2017",Susie,2.0,,Maker stopped working after two months... keeps asking to fill tank.. super annoying.
"December 7, 2013",N Z of California,5.0,,"This is our second one. Had to replace first one as the heater that keeps the coffee hot after brewing, went out after about a year.  We fresh grind our beans and set this p the evening before and set it to brew ust as we are waking. The smell is get and what a treat to get up to the best coffee you will ever want.  Get buy for the money."
"February 21, 2018",Carolyn Townsend,5.0,,It really works great for nasal congestion.
"October 23, 2015",DeLane,5.0,,My only like of this product is that I can't smell the nasty acrid brew.  Mary Cates The husband and family loves it and use it daily.

"December 19, 2020",Daniel O.,1.0,,"This coffee maker leaks all over, so not buy this. The spout creates a drip edge that makes the coffee leak down the back edge."

"January 30, 2016",Iden R,5.0,,"I love it! I do not understand why this product has any negative reviews. The coffee brews nice, and has no burnt coffee taste. There is no glass carafe so you can pour into any cup with ease. The coffee stays heated for up to four hours. I would definitely recommend this product."
"April 27, 2015",Martin,3.0,One,"I must begin by saying that I do like the coffee maker very much.  However, under the coffee reservoir are 2 openings that hold water.  It then drains out when these openings are full and make a mess on the counter.  I do not know how to correct this issue.  I wouldn't buy this brand again."

"May 24, 2017",jason g. duncan,5.0,,Great design
"November 1, 2015",Tom,5.0,,Brews very fast. Not tall enough for my travel mug but not a big deal. Coffee is a good drinking temp straight from the pot. Does not get very hot. If you like really hot coffee this pot may not be for you.
"May 22, 2013",Jerry Klein,4.0,,Simple and a great single cup for a larger group or guests. Makes an excellent cup of coffee. This supplements my CBTL single cup coffee/espresso unit. It is a bit cumbersome to clean and load but it is inexpensive and does a great job of making coffee.!!
"November 30, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I love my coffee pot. This is my 2nd one I can set it to start my coffee at night. Timers works great. maker works no problem.

"April 24, 2017",Yvonne McKim,3.0,2,"While the coffee pot works well, as i expected, it is not put together well.  The water resevoir does not sit flush against the coffee pot. It sits angled and while it does not leak now, I would expect it will as it ages."
"March 23, 2017",empa,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker. So much better than traditional ones with the carafe. Coffee is always hot, easy to operate, and clean."
"December 17, 2014",D,1.0,One,"This product was broken from the beginning.  It was a gift, so that was a little embarrassing to give a broken gift.  Don't waste your money, just go to a store."
"September 16, 2015",Steve Ginder,5.0,,This is by far better than the last HB coffee maker that we had.  That is not to say it wasn't good.  This one is sooo much easier to fill and I can't understand why we couldn't find this in the local stores.
"January 2, 2021",gary schaubschlager,2.0,,It does not seem to work well. It leaves a lot of of moisture in the area around the grounds.
"October 11, 2015",MaggieMae,4.0,,This is my third HB coffee maker. Love the convenience of one cup at a time The coffee stays fresh much longer. One problem I have is that they leak after a while and have to be replaced.
"August 21, 2015",Deanna Blackmon,2.0,One,"Less than 90 days after purchase, our Brew Station started leaking from the dispenser. I have run vinegar/water through several times to clean, to no avail. Of course, it's no longer returnable so we are stuck with a Brew Station that doesn't work effectively. We are very sad that our Coffee Maker started leaking so soon after purchase."
"December 18, 2019",CHERYL,5.0,,Love it and no more pot.

"June 3, 2017",Erica Grace,4.0,,I like it but I had higher expectations I guess. Still beats using a caraffe
"May 3, 2018",Erin,1.0,,"I had this product before and lovedd it, but I got a lemon this time. There is a short in the serving bar so the time has to be set after every pot. I lived the clean feature but one this one, the clean light is always on ,even after cleaning."

"February 27, 2016",Wilkerda,5.0,,"This thing is boss. Everyday, I get a ""day x"" review of how awesome it is from my wife. Even the tallest mugs can be tilted to extract coffee from this amazing machine."
"January 10, 2016",myway,2.0,3,"We really wanted to like this coffee maker.  We like not having a carafe and it makes good coffee.  That said, it has a vent on the back that accommodates the shape of the lid and steam pours out of the vent when it's brewing and soaked the under side of our cabinets and the wall behind the coffee maker.  We didn't notice it at first.  It needs to be backed up to a wall so that it will hold steady while you depress the coffee button.  We even tried pulling it out while it brewed, but then it steamed up the front of the cabinets.  I cannot afford to take a chance on it ruining my cabinets.  It would be 5 stars for us if it weren't for what we consider a design defect.  I would recommend checking under your cabinets for moisture if you have this coffee maker  Sadly returned.  Will try the Cuisinart model."
"November 6, 2015",Nikta222,1.0,4,"I've been a big fan of the Hamilton Beach coffee dispensers for awhile. But unfortunately they don't make them like they used to. I had one last for 7 or 8 years before it died, and I had to go with a newer model. TWICE. This model was the first of two. Both of them lasted less than a year before crapping out, and we cleaned them daily, and deep-cleaned/descaled every few months. Both times, it would stop brewing before using up all the water in the tank, and sound like galloping horses by the end of the cycle. At long last, I think I have to move to a different brand."
"February 7, 2021",Omar Alaji,2.0,,"I had this coffeemaker for years and bought another one.  This one leaks very badly, so will be returning it"
"March 17, 2013",theholstiens,5.0,,I got this coffee maker for entertaining.  I have used it several times now and it's worked out great!  I have even left the coffee in the machine hot for up to 4 hours and it still tastes great (not burnt or anything).
"September 6, 2019",Deloreswojcik,5.0,,Make coffee every morning. Love how convenient it is to use. Makes great coffee and very easy cleanup.
"August 23, 2014",Kathy Shepherd,5.0,,"LOVE IT!  We could not have designed a better coffeemaker ourselves!  The coffee is wonderful.  The BOLD setting makes richer tasting coffee while using less coffee.  Besides all that, I looks great on the counter."
"December 5, 2019",Holly Gayle Kelly,5.0,,It was well worth the money and wait. I love that it is all inclusive. no glass to break and worry about....
"January 27, 2015",AllLove,5.0,,"This is a great coffee pot! I just got it, set it up and I had hot coffee that wasn't scortched when I left for work 3 hours later!! That made my day. It's easy to fill, Easy to pour a cup of coffee, no drips or spills, easy to clean up."
"July 1, 2020",Mikaela Bradley,1.0,,Bought 2 units in the last few days....both leaked all over the counter. Would never purchase this again. Poor design and would not recommend anyone purchase this coffee maker
"November 18, 2013",Richard Wagoner,5.0,One,"Can't say enough about this. Makes great coffee and is VERY convenient. A little hard to clean if you want the inside to look spotless, but the internal coffee stains don't bother me."
"November 5, 2012",janice a.,5.0,40,"For our last 4 coffee makers we purchased only Hamilton Beach Brew Stations. This latest is the best so far due to the separate water tank. While I agree with others that a light would be helpful under the fill spout, the only thing that really concerns me is the percolating sound it makes for the entire 2 hours that it is keeping our coffee warm. None of the other models over the years have made this continuous noise. One year later: it still makes the percolating sound but I feel sure it is of no concern since the coffee maker is working great after an entire year of 3-4 pots a day usage."
"March 30, 2020",Barbara Wininger,5.0,,Love this coffee maker So easy to use worth the  money.
"September 14, 2015",FrankT,4.0,,"Lots better than the older model, still wish it had something to push like the Cuisinart does for coffee to come out.  good price, good coffee and easy to use."
"April 16, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,This was  great while it lasted... unfortunately it was just about 1 year. Now it is leaking and wasting our coffee.
"June 21, 2016",nmw,5.0,,really like it. no more glass pots for me to accidentally bash against the counter or drop. and no more spills from trying to pour too fast
"April 9, 2017",Dusty,5.0,,"Get a HOT Cuppa!  I like my Tea Hot, hubby likes his coffee Hot!  This coffee maker fits both of our needs!  It is most cost effective!"
"April 17, 2021",Wayne Paquette,2.0,,In the morning I do 12 cups some mornings only 6 cups brew and I have to push the on off button again
"July 16, 2015",David Gerhardt,2.0,,"Nice, very convenient for on the go people. Not so convenient when you wake up to no coffee and water all over the counter and floor. I clean the reservoir everyday. Run white vinegar through every other week and it still leaks. Sometimes it makes coffee and leaks or doesn't make coffee and leaks. Wish there was a fix but Hamilton says they will replace it with a different model."
"September 11, 2015",D.A.K,4.0,,Works good accept once you turn it off (if you leave and come back) it's hard to get it to stay back on.  Also the timer does not count down...or it's broken.  Otherwise it's been good so far.
"December 1, 2017",betty nelson,5.0,,Bought as a gift. I wouldn't buy any other coffeemaker. I have enjoyed my Hamilton beach coffeemaker for many years.
"January 6, 2018",Kindle Customer,3.0,,I like this machine but we've only been using it for about 6 months and the heating element doesn't seem to be working very well already.
"April 17, 2016",Patrick J.,5.0,,"Brews coffee quick, doesn't burn it, and dispenses very neatly. No spills trying to pour coffee anymore. Get compliments everytime someone uses it. The only downside I experienced was that I tried to use a reusable filter and it was a wee bit to tall might be just the brand. Extra coffee pours easily out of caraffe into bottles for ice free iced coffee."
"October 24, 2015",Orthodoxy,5.0,,"This is just what I've been wanting.  It's easy to operate, and to set.  Best of all--no carafes to clean or to turn dingy after a while.  Just the right amount of coffee with no spills."
"May 3, 2019",Josue Mendoza,5.0,,Such a conveniant a simple to use product... Bought it as a house warming gift and now I want one for myself as well.
"January 2, 2020",Liz Quick,5.0,,Works as expected.
"September 7, 2020",JAK,5.0,,Love it and easy to use
"November 14, 2019",Jennifer taggart,5.0,,Keeps coffee hot. Great taste and easy to use. I love it as much as my morning coffee.

"February 27, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"First one broke right away, they sent me a replacement and the new one is now no good."
"May 29, 2017",Patricia67y,5.0,One,"This is so easy to use, keep clean and it makes really good iced coffee. It does not require as much coffee as is recommended in the directions."
"March 9, 2021",Georgia VALADIE,2.0,,"Product leaks, has to be against a wall to avoid it sliding. Obnoxious to prep as the coffee basket drips all over"
"February 20, 2016",MaggieMae982,5.0,,Great coffee maker!  No burned coffee taste - dispense as wanted.  Takes up little counter space.  Makes great coffee.

"December 4, 2016",Geri,5.0,,Love this unit!  Haven't figured out the programming yet but love the fact it has no glass carafe.
"December 20, 2016",Alex Robertson,5.0,,"My parents have one like this, so we got one for my in-laws for Christmas. Great coffee maker and a great price as well."
"March 8, 2016",Alice Kish,5.0,,The most excellent coffeemaker ever.  I have severe arthritis in my wrists and elbows.  This avoids lifting a heavy carafe every time I want a cup of coffee.  The lightweight bucket with handle makes its very easy to fill and pour into coffemaker.  I have had several of these and several other coffeemakers and always come back to this one.
"May 11, 2015",Trina Hoefling,4.0,,"If the cord were longer, I'd give it a 5 star. It's SO short I almost gave it a 3 star. Otherwise so easy to use, clean, pour, keep coffee from burning."
"February 20, 2019",DG,5.0,,"The best coffee maker we have found. Simple to use, clean and reload."
"November 23, 2020",Douglas M Edwards,4.0,,works well

"February 12, 2021",Daniel Conchola,3.0,,Nice product. Keeps my coffee warm and flavorful but leaks when you press the button for a cup of coffee
"December 28, 2018",Natalie Phillips,4.0,,This was a replacement coffee maker and I do like it better but only drawback is that it isn’t intuitive in where to put water. Bit of a strange set up but works fine. Good coffee maker for the money.
"July 11, 2021",Kindle Customer,4.0,,I like no carafe that sits and lets coffee overheat/scorch
"December 29, 2019",Ben,5.0,,The removable reservoir makes filling the water extra easy
"February 3, 2019",Al Boland,5.0,,Make coffe every day. easy to prepare.
"December 10, 2019",Buffie,2.0,,There should be a light. I couldn't see the amount of coffee and it over filled and burned my hand.
"January 16, 2019",Doug Mccray,5.0,,This is our 2nd one we love them
"March 2, 2018",ML Norm,1.0,,I have owned many of this exact model. This particular machine leaks coffee out of the dispenser. All over my brand new counter tops. I'd like to return/replace it but the return window closed 6 days ago. $40 flushed right down the toilet.
"September 13, 2016",Kenneth E. Sternberg,4.0,One,This was great until it started leaking.  It made better coffee than the ore expensive one I replaced it with.
"December 30, 2019",Nancy Banoff,5.0,,Like the fact that the coffee  stays nice and hot. I have owed one of these pots for the last 6 years.  I Love it
"January 6, 2014",BobnBevthomas,1.0,,I had to return this - it leaked horribly from the water resourvoir.  I was really disappointed because it would have been the perfect set up for my husband and I.  Went back to basic Mr. Coffee -- never lets me down.
"July 25, 2018",Melissa Jacobia,4.0,,Great coffee maker other than it doesn't keep it hot enough for my taste. I like it REALLY hot though.
"January 27, 2020",Dennis Clay,3.0,,Easy to clean. Dispenser is hard and the pot moves around unless you hold it with your hand.
"December 1, 2016",Bob'sYourUncle,5.0,One,This is a great little coffee maker form a respectable company. It has lasted me a long time so far.
"December 8, 2020",Kathleen A. Fischer,2.0,,I’ve had this exact product before and loved it but this is the 2nd replacement and it leaks when dispensing the coffee
"February 5, 2020",Kathleen Tiberii,1.0,,Coffee pot is terrible.  Doesn’t keep coffee hot and the burner base even when cleaned everyday burned out
"October 10, 2013",Connie Hendrix,5.0,,Coffee Makers that do not have a carafe are very hard to find. This one not only looks perfect in our camper kitchen but is a very high quality machine that makes a great cup of coffee AND you can program it to keep it warm for hours!
"March 23, 2014",mariann,5.0,,"After reading reviews I was afraid we would not like the coffeemaker. We have found no problem pouring water into the reservoir. We also did not find the dispenser bar a problem. We use regular coffee mugs but if we want to use a thermo mug to take on the road and have a problem, I would just full a cup and transfer it to the thermo mug. It keeps the coffee hotter than our old programmable coffeemaker and we like that it can be set to keep hot for 4 hours. For the price, I feel this was an excellent buy"
"May 29, 2018",Carroll Miller,3.0,,Its alright but it make noise brews slow and sometimes leaks
"December 12, 2018",Harvey,5.0,,The first time I used it the coffee was fresh and I set the timer to keep it warm . Every time I poured a cup of coffee it was still hot .

"December 9, 2015",Ryan DeMesa,3.0,,Handle of the coffee ground holder broke the second week of use due to heat generated from the internal thermal heating. Cheap plastics. Hope this thing survives more than a year.

"September 12, 2014",Francobel,3.0,One,"It makes coffee / think work drip coffee with no frills, but it does it well. Don't expect to be taken on a dream voyage to Italy or Brazil. Just simple and reliable way to make a joe"

"November 2, 2019",Robert r Dake,5.0,,The only draw back is you can't pour from the container
"May 19, 2014",Vonnie DeFreese,1.0,One,"Disappointed by the cumbersome cleaning and prep that it takes to make a pot of coffee.  Also, it does not make 12 cups; more like 8 and we don't use huge mugs; also, do not understand the water tha accumulates in the pot under the coffee receptical.  A mess to clean up.  Definitely would not buy this again nor recommend to another."

"January 8, 2018",Allison white,1.0,,"Love the idea of this coffee pot and loved the first pot of coffee I made in it. Unfortunately, while making my second pot, the water reservoir slipped in the sink when it was filling and part of the lid broke off. So not the lid doesn’t stay on. So it doesn’t seem to me to be very well made."
"April 16, 2017",Herman Jr,5.0,,I had one of the early models and it leaked clear water all the time.  This one hasn't leaked a drop of water or coffee yet.  It works great and seems to be operating exactly as it was designed to.
"February 28, 2013",Sue D,3.0,,"This coffee brewer makes great coffee but I'm not overly happy with how drippy it is.  When you lift the top up to fill it, condensation from the coffeemaker drips all over the countertop.  I also don't care for the very short cord that it has.  It really limits me as to where I can place my coffeemaker."
"January 15, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Its very light. We like all the other features. The bold flavor feature is great.
"October 30, 2016",Ben & Susan,5.0,,I love this coffee maker.  This is the second one we purchased.  The first one lasted us several years.

"August 15, 2014",MG,5.0,,"Power surge blew my other Brewstation, so I bought another. Love that I am able to keep it hot for up to 4 hours (unlike my wife), and that it just takes the push of a button to get it going (also unlike my wife)."

"October 24, 2017",David M. Bunting,1.0,,1st one leaked all the water out of it drowning the lazy Susan cabinet under the counter.  Was replaced by one that makes 5 cups of coffee.  What are you getting??? Refurbished or factory seconds?  Won't buy another after years of using this model.

I read a lot about it making a mess, but mines did great never did make a mess yet and I've been having mines for a month.

"May 1, 2016",Skippy,1.0,One,I used to love Hamilton Beach. I give this coffee two thumbs down. The coffee pot leaks from the bottom and the back side. Also the filter unit does not fit flush too the coffee. I ordered a replacement same thing happened.

"April 23, 2016",Traci T.,5.0,,"I forgot how much better fresh brewed coffee tasted.  I have been using a Keurig for a few years now and buying a new box of k-cups almost every week.  That got expensive.  I like that this coffee maker doesn't use a traditional carafe and hot plate to keep the coffee warm.  You can set the timer to keep your coffee warm for up to 4 hours and it doesn't burn and taste bitter.  You can also reset the timer after the 4 hours if you want to reheat the coffee. The brewer automatically shuts off after either it is done brewing or after the ""keep warm"" time is over.  It has brew strength settings if you are making 1-4 cups or want a stronger brew.  I read a review or two that said the dispenser wasn't set out far enough and that the coffee would run down the side of the cup.  I haven't run into that problem using any of the mugs that I have.  I wouldn't set the mug on the drip plate and push the dispenser button by hand.  Hold the mug and use it to push the dispenser button.  It is also very easy to pour out the leftover coffee and clean."
"August 23, 2019",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Excellent. However sometimes it gets moldy. But very easy to use. Good coffee.
"August 30, 2015",Rometta Cameron,1.0,One,"I received the coffee maker and excitedly cleaned it and made my first pot of coffee. The coffee was Lukewarm. I thought to myself, well maybe it needs to get started and will get better as I use it. I kept it for a week, still lukewarm. I found out it heats a it sits, however, it also burns the coffee as it sits. So, if I want hot coffee, it's burned and if I want good coffee it's cold!!! I returned the coffee maker..."
"October 20, 2020",beccy,1.0,,Started leaking 10 months after purchase to the point it would drain a pot before a cup could be dispensed
"March 6, 2016",Alex Juel,3.0,,"It looks great, but it's a bit of hassle having to remove the filter basket from the water container every morning. I wish I would've ordered the model that has a water chamber on the side of the machine instead. It's still a fine machine though, and works as expected."
"January 19, 2019",Talha,3.0,,It is okay. Average quality.
"March 22, 2021",Lynda Altman,5.0,,I like its streamline look! This is my 3rd coffee pot like this.
"March 18, 2021",WCR,2.0,,It makes good hot coffee. When you pour a cup it leaks all over.
"January 15, 2016",Lorraine E. Frantz,5.0,One,"Great product. I'm not a complainer, but...the cord is a tad too short"

"August 27, 2018",Amazon Customer,1.0,,I purchased in May 2018 and at the end of July it had quit working. I had tried to reach out to the product support team but never received a response back..
"October 6, 2017",Roger Dale Thompson,5.0,,Great Coffee
"May 12, 2017",Karen McMahon,2.0,,"Sometimes the coffee is way too strong and sometimes it comes out way too weak, like ice tea color.  I thought it might be my fault at first but it's definitely the machine!  Disappointed."
"October 26, 2018",Michael Q.,5.0,,Makes great coffee and keeps it hot
"April 18, 2016",Danielle,5.0,,great for the price. I love the timer feature on this. Overall great product!

"November 27, 2020",Maria,5.0,,It was exactly what I was looking for
"June 20, 2016",R Daniels,1.0,15,"The ""gentle warming plate"" in our unit kept coffee at a simmer loud enough to hear across the room. Coffee tasted burnt within 30 minutes & it felt like a potential fire hazard.  Initially, I contacted Hamilton Beach customer service to replace with the same model, but their only options are to send them proof we have disabled our unit and then live without a coffee maker for 7-10 business days while they ship a new one free or to pay an $11.95 shipping fee up front to keep using this one until the new one arrives, which kind of feels like extortion. Amazon customer service is so much better - they are allowing us to ship this one back for free & we will replace through amazon with a coffee maker from another manufacturer.  I was willing to try another of these with the thought that ours was a lemon, but Hamilton Beach's customer service is so bad, I don't ever want to deal with them again. Buyer beware."
"September 14, 2012",KathleenM,5.0,,"I've had this product for about a month. I'm very happy with it. Coffee tastes great, stays hot, and the maker will stay on for four hours if you choose. Our previous maker would shut off after two hours. I also love that it beeps when the coffee is finished brewing to let you know it's ready. Very satisfied."
"July 5, 2019",Joan b. null,1.0,,"This was the worst product from Hamilton Beach,that I ever purchased. It was defective,however,besides this,it was less than ready for use. Thank you Joan B.Null"
"February 13, 2018",Cynthia Lowery,4.0,,Great coffee maker - only complaint is the part that your coffee mug sits on needs to be longer - my cup barely fits!
"November 8, 2014",DLC,5.0,,"Makes a great tasting cup of coffee.  As good as a French Press, without the hassle.  Easy clean up and fits under our cabinets.  I like no glass carafe. Using a gold mesh filter."
"June 6, 2020",chris,5.0,,Love it
"May 21, 2015",S.M.,1.0,2,Went away gently in the night.  Worked for only a couple months.

"January 4, 2014",scraphappy,4.0,,"The water is located perfectly and makes it real easy to make the coffee. The only problem I have found so far, the coffee is not hot enough as soon as the coffee makes. It does get hotter as time goes by."
"March 21, 2021",Kristi Renzi,3.0,,Convenient but leaks around the dispenser and coffee gets on the countertop.
"February 21, 2021",mike s,5.0,,Convenient!
"February 5, 2015",wyhawker,4.0,,"I love not having the carafe! In the last few years I have had three of them and my current one seems to be leaking water already. They still need to perfect it. It would have been less stars, but I just love it!"
"November 13, 2019",Taryn Jacobus,5.0,,We really like this design
"August 21, 2019",Courtney,5.0,,"I bought this for my parents after their older coffee maker bit the dust. They absolutely love it and use it everyday. The programming is easy, no leaks, and stays warm for hours."

"February 15, 2017",JOHN,5.0,,love it

"October 13, 2015",Keith H. Colton,5.0,,This is a great coffee machine. It allows me to have my morning coffee whenever I'm ready for it and just the way I like it.
"April 28, 2021",Therese Schantz,5.0,,the ONLY part i dislike is cleaning
"April 17, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Excellent product.  Love the 14 cup capacity. Fast brew.  Good heat for always hot coffee. Easy to clean.  I wish the clock background was lighted, but can live without that."
"July 25, 2019",A S H,5.0,,Makes great iced coffee for a low price.  Keeps coffee hot and fresh and no pot to break.
"May 19, 2017",Maynard*Is*My*God,2.0,One,"If I could go back and stop myself from buying this, then I would. It would be so much better if there wasn't a coffee stained puddle underneath it every day. The permanent filter I already had was too tall, so I bought some paper filters for the first time in years. When I was able to purchase a new permanent filter I clicked on the one that said ""frequently bought together"" because I figured ""Hey, this one will actually fit the coffee maker, and the lid will close properly."" Nope, didn't happen. While it does close better (but only by about two hairs!) than it did with the filter I already had, it STILL DOES NOT CLOSE PROPERLY. All in all, this coffee maker really kinda sucks."
"March 3, 2014",Mwessel,5.0,One,"I bought this coffee pot for my mom and she loves it. I programmed it for her and all she has to do is fill the reservoir and put coffee in at night and then push a button, when she wakes her coffee is ready for her. I think I did not notice when I purchased it was that it makes iced coffee as well.  That was a pleasant surprise."
"August 18, 2015",David in SC,5.0,,"Love this coffee maker.  Makes great coffee and keeps it warm.  Easy to fill, easy to clean and it looks good on the counter."

"December 16, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,we love it
"October 30, 2015",John,5.0,,"After having a Mr. Coffee for about 6 months, the coating on the hotplate began to flake off. It all eventually came off and the hotplate became completely rusted. I seen this and was curious to give it a try. The coffee actually taste better even all the way to the last cup without becoming bitter. Will never go back to a Mr. Coffee!"
"June 21, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Haven't even had this product two months and it's already leaking water out of the bottom when brewing.
"April 13, 2012",D. Walden,5.0,2,"I was a little worried because I've read some reviews that really say they have had problems with this Brewstation, but I haven't had a single problem. I love that it keeps the coffee warm for 4 hours without burning it bitter, and that you can set it up to be ready when you wake in the morning. Easy to use features are a big plus.  I've had none of the problems stated about the dispencer at all and it seems to work great for both travel mugs and coffee cups. You can't go wrong here it's a great machine"
"August 21, 2014",Harry W. Moak,3.0,,"This is a little better design than previous models.  However, it still has the condensation drip into a resevoit\r that needs to be sopped up each brewing.  They need to get some better engineers!"
"February 1, 2017",HaKrueg,4.0,,Love it but cause work on the water leakage part.
"December 6, 2016",Dorothy E. McLeod,1.0,,I love the concept but the maker only worked twice before it wouldn't turn on anymore.  I am taking a chance on reordering a replacement.  If the same thing happens I will swear off of Hamilton Beach products or maybe Amazon.
"January 20, 2016",SandyC,5.0,One,Just replaced the same coffee maker we had for 5 years.  We wore the old one out - used it every single day.  Makes perfect coffee.  Love that there is no glass carafe.
"March 2, 2014",Brent Quick,5.0,,"This coffeemaker looks great on my countertop and makes great coffee.  The only drawback I can foresee would be that it's pretty tall, so make sure it fits under cabinets where you're going to put it before ordering."
"October 20, 2020",Marisela Romero,5.0,,"Súper bella, resistente y útil, amo mi súper cafetera"
"January 11, 2017",DM Ramsey,5.0,,Works great!
"June 30, 2020",Sandie,3.0,,This brand new coffee pot dribbles coffee down the front plate while I'm filling my cup...!  NOT HAPPY!!!
"February 6, 2020",John,1.0,,they could have put it on the front to keep dry
"March 29, 2021",JD,1.0,,Want to return....drips coffee . Not happy
"March 21, 2021",Zachary,1.0,,Worst coffee maker ever. It leaks from the push button. Had to buy another coffee maker.
"May 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I absolutely love my coffee station. Easy to fill and use and stays hot for up to 4 hrs.
"November 2, 2016",patricia koegl,5.0,,better system than my previous Cusineart--easier to fill and the brewing coffee does not overflow the basket if you put a little too much coffee in or use a very fine grind. I really like this system
"April 3, 2014",krpederson2000@yahoo.com,5.0,One,I love that I wake up and my coffee is already made and I just pick up a cup and fill it up. Its easy to clean and program. I don't have time or patience for multiple steps especially in the morning before I have had coffee. I highly recommend this coffee maker if you are always in a rush in the morning.
"February 27, 2020",Renee Caldwell,5.0,,This is my second time purchasing this coffee maker and I love it. I don't even use my Keurig anymore.
"May 13, 2016",John Chakroff,5.0,,I love this product!!!  I like my coffee piping HOT & this product delivers!!!  We are camper's and I have a second identical coffee maker in my RV!!!!  AMAZON has the best price!!!

"May 20, 2020",A Bradley,5.0,,So nice!
"November 7, 2014",DawnPed,5.0,,My favorite!  No more carafe to break and keeps warm without burning for up to 4 hours! The New design makes putting in the water do much easier. No pouring. Great for older people with Unsteady hands.
"October 16, 2018",Patrick A. Diamond,4.0,,Rubber slip stop feet come out easily. Otherwise good unit.
"June 25, 2019",tulip,5.0,,So glad I bought this
"June 17, 2018",Morgie,4.0,,It didn't last very long.
"January 15, 2014",Carol L. Ball,3.0,,"I like the operation of this coffee maker, the brewing design is outstanding.  I do not like this machine because, it does not keep the coffee very hot.  It is brewed being drinkable.  I mean it is not HOT.  Also, if you have coffee left over from the morning time, you can not reheat the coffee in this machine.  It has to be heated in the microwave, YUCK. If the coffee was HOT and you could reheat left over coffee, then I would have rated it a 5 STAR Coffee Brewer"
"December 6, 2017",Heidi,5.0,,freaking love this. fast hot brew and stays hot. even makes iced coffee
"April 28, 2014",Lisa Taylor,5.0,One,"Great coffee and hot when I need it. Much easier that my Krueger and much less expensive to use.  So glad I found this!!! Can see a Christmas gift in the future, actually more than one. :)"
"September 21, 2019",Edna Howard,5.0,,best coffee pot i have ever had.  Coffee dose not get old no matter how long it set in the pot.
"June 7, 2017",John McCaffrey,4.0,,"This is a great coffee maker, however, if you have the counter space, get the unit with the water reservoir on the side (Model #47900).  I am sure it will be easier to fill.  I do like the instant dispenser and the timer/programmable function."
"September 23, 2015",anon,1.0,One,After only a few months of occasional use this coffee maker leaks everywhere.  Very poorly made.  Poor design.
"June 4, 2021",Arlin McGee,1.0,,Leaks coffee on countertop!! Do not recommend!!
"December 1, 2018",Ryan M.,1.0,,"Product arrived and leaks all of the water out of it. Luckily, this was bought to replace the same model that was worn out and the part that was leaking was replaced with my old unit. Not worth my time to return the whole unit."
"October 8, 2019",Darla,5.0,,This is the only coffee pot I could take to work and everyone is pleased.
"January 29, 2018",Ken,3.0,,I like that the coffee stays hot and I can take one cup at a time.  I also like I don’t have to worry about turning it off.  What I don’t like about it is that it is very noisy.  I’ve never had a coffee pot make as much noise as this one does both in brewing and keeping it warm.
"October 4, 2014",Mary S. Petit,5.0,,"I loved it but after 6 months, It  QUIT keeping my coffee hot. I kept it cleand it out when the clean light came on and everything the book told me to do. With me checking it out, I found out the bottom burner that keep the coffee HOT was not working. I really would like another one, but me on social security alone I'm not able to afford another one. I'm hoping maybe you will replace it and send me another one. I sure would be thankful to you.  Mary Petit"
"July 12, 2021",jeff,2.0,,Do not like the engineering of the water reservoir. We always end up spilling water on the counter…..
"January 16, 2017",Mike N.,5.0,,Works great... and makes really good coffee... Quiet for a coffee maker and dispenser is awesome...
"April 7, 2014",Sally G.,4.0,,"So far this works well.  The warmer does not scorch the coffee.  It makes a sizzling noise until the warming plate switches off after the time limit.  Also, there is a lot of condensation on the lid and grounds basket, making it difficult to empty without dripping water all over."
"June 30, 2016",Changry,3.0,,"Cleaning this thing sucks, but other than that it's good."
"October 14, 2010",Amazon Customer,4.0,2,"Ordered because a friend had one a his coffee was hotter that earlier model that I owned.  Brews faster, can use taller cups to draw coffee, easier to fill with water.  I did not notice that my coffee was hotter than before.  Still, best Hamilton Beach Brewstation yet."
"February 21, 2018",Johnny H Stevens,5.0,,good pot
"August 6, 2016",Kathleen,5.0,2,Great little coffee maker! No spills. It is very well designed. Would definitely recommend.
"January 8, 2014",Lawman102,5.0,,This is a replacement for our home coffee pot which was an older Hamilton Beach Brewstation. We also have one in our RV and really like how hot they keep the coffee without burning it.
"January 5, 2017",Richard Trimble,5.0,,this replaces the old one / i make two 12 cup pots per day / hot coffee is what is best for cleaning out mt throat / i had cancer of the throat with chemo and radiation / so i lost use of my saliva glans / and this machine has lived up yo the HAMILTON BEACH name / so thanks for making a great product / your fellow workers our doing a GREAT job / smile / GOD bless
"December 6, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Nice but not heavy enough whole pot moves when pushed for a cup of coffee!

"February 5, 2016",Chris D.,5.0,,"This is my third purchase of this coffee maker.  I don't believe I could ever go back to using a carafe.  All in all it's just a cleaner, sleeker coffee machine."
"May 21, 2021",Don Watson,3.0,,"We have used this style of pot for years, this pot is not shutting off when you dispense the coffee!"
"March 14, 2020",Wendy Baxley,2.0,,I bought a new one because my old one was leaking and now the new one is leaking. Very disappointed.
"October 7, 2013",Patricia,4.0,,"We're enjoying the new coffeemaker...the only thing that we don't like about it is that you have to take the whole top part off (that holds the coffee & grounds when done) to fill with water. This is a inconvenience for older people, but I see the advantage for cleaning it..with the other one that we had we couldn't do this.  Other than that we love the coffeemaker.. esp. like being able to get one cup at a time.  Pat"
"May 5, 2016",LetTheGoodTimesRoll,5.0,,"Easy to use and well made.  Very nice that carafe does not sit on a burner, or break easily."
"September 18, 2014",Christy Welch,3.0,,Love the Brewmaster in general - but as other reviews mention (I ignored them) After putting creamer in (not much at all) I have to nuke my cup because the heating element does not heat the coffee up hot enough. Bummed me out!
"June 14, 2014",Indiana Customer,5.0,,Bought it to replace another HB Brewstation that is being moved to a camping site.  Love both - good quality & easy to use.  Auto shut off a blessing!
"December 30, 2019",Heather Williams,5.0,,We love this product! Easy to use and makes delicious coffee every time!
"February 14, 2019",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"We thought that this would be a good option for our salon, as a replacement for our Kuerig. This type of machine is a good idea in theory, because the waste is minimal.  Unfortunately, this machine burns the coffee. It tastes like burnt rubber bands. We're sending it back."
"December 2, 2016",Mary Ann Gwinn,4.0,,Very nice convenient coffee pot.
"January 3, 2019",April Pruitt,5.0,,We had to return the first one because it did not keep coffee hot- within one week of purchase- the second one has broken. The dispenser lever quit working. Absolutely loved this pot but the durability is not there
"December 5, 2016",kattididit,5.0,,love my coffeepot...replaced a well used older purchase.  This pot usually lasts about one year before it starts to leak and make a mess.
"May 27, 2019",w.baldaro,2.0,,"I looked forward to not having a pot, turns out the alternative did not heat the coffee well. The dispenser  tended to dribble during a pour."
"August 22, 2017",Patricia A. Elliott,1.0,,This product does not make good coffee. It tastes bitter and burned and I use Peet's coffee! I have tried it in every setting and nothing helps the taste. I would like to return it and I see i am past the return date. I do like the push button pour feature and that is it.
"February 10, 2021",Dianne Serafin,2.0,,Each cup leaks . From the first cup.
"January 26, 2017",Bonnie,5.0,,This coffee maker replaced the same kind that we have had for a while.  No coffee pot to break which is a plus.  Came promptly and in good conditions.
"March 3, 2021",joe hale,5.0,,Very good coffee maker would recommend recommend this one
"October 17, 2016","Betty, Ohio",5.0,,"I haven't used this pot yet, we have one just like it that is still working fine, seen this as a good deal so decided to get for a spare.."
"May 16, 2014",Joselle,5.0,,Replaced an older version. Like this one just as well. Like the newer features with this one: 4 hr warmer instead of shut off after 2 hrs. Also touch screen controls better.
"July 1, 2016",Dee,5.0,,"This coffee machine works great. No issues so far. Makes good tasting coffee quick. The different functions are nice, strength of coffee bold or regular, set a brew time, keeps coffee warm for hours, cold coffee option and you can make 1 cup or 12 cups. Great price for a really nice coffee machine."
"January 29, 2020",Whitey,1.0,,Less than two months of use and it started leaking BADLY through the seal on heating plate.

"March 4, 2021",gina williams,2.0,,Love the dispenser type maker but this one leaks while dispensing. So disappointing!
"September 10, 2016",Bill Herman,5.0,One,After a week the pot will be seasoned and you'll have excellent coffee. Super easy to use a no glass to break. We grind our beans super fine for a rich cup.
"June 11, 2021",Jego,1.0,,Product is worthless doesn’t brew hot coffee even if u program it It’s a piece of u know what
"August 20, 2019",Jerome Jackson,5.0,,I love this coffee pot because it does cold and hot coffee in cup servings. Just coffee right now.
"October 28, 2019",Robert Witconis,5.0,,Best coffee maker I’ve owned. Well designed. I hope it last a long time.
"May 3, 2016",Shutterbri23,5.0,,Much better than the last model. Doesn't leak. Super easy to use. Very easy to clean. Coffee is hot. My tall coffee cups finally fit under the spout.
"May 4, 2016",wells,5.0,,great coffeemaker. this is the 3rd one i bought for people
"December 2, 2016",AZnana1019,1.0,,"Very flimsy, coffee boils continuously on keep warm settings, extremely disappointed!"
"August 23, 2014",Eileen Wilson,4.0,,"We love our Brewstation!  So easy to make delicious hot and iced coffee with.  Does not make a mess when filling your cup like previous Brewstations we have owned.  My only complaint is specific to making iced coffee: after putting the water in the bottom tank, I take the top part to the freezer to fill with ice, and that part drips all over the place.  It's very possible it's just user error, and I have taken to putting a towel beneath I when transporting."
"January 25, 2018",DL,4.0,,"This is a good coffee maker if you want one without the carafe. It has a few ""ah-ha's"" that I didn't anticipate. The Pros: -it's programmable: coffee is ready when you wake (or get home) -change brew strength: I like BOLD coffee so I use the BOLD setting and i full scoop per cup of coffee -easy to clean The Con's: -you cannot dispense coffee from the front if the power is not turned on. -you have to take the filter holder out and then take out coffee container to pour from there much like a carafe -the little feet on the bottom are quite grippy (it does not slide on the counter). this is a con until I took them off, now it slides easily and I can pull it out I wanted a coffee maker w/o the carafe. I thought it would keep things neater but it really dosent. it's a good machine, it makes a good cup of coffee and overall I'm very happy I spent the money on this one."
"March 2, 2016",pagal,5.0,,My husband has rheumatoid arthritis and cannot pour coffee from a carafe.  This coffee maker is unique in that all he has to do is push his cup on the bar and the coffee is dispensed into his cup.  I also love this unique feature and not having to constantly clean a pot.  It is well made and makes great coffee!
"February 6, 2020",randall betts,4.0,,I was very pleased. It's easy to use & clean. I use folgers for & it was very flavorful.
"November 27, 2020",Patsy Fiorito,5.0,,Have had this coffee maker for many years when it finally gave up. That's the reason I purchased another one. Like it very much.
"December 31, 2016",Jb,1.0,3,"Wish I would have listened to the reviews about the plastic smell and taste.  This is one poor product compared to the older models.  We owned one from about 4 years ago and replaced with this.  The plastic is more plentiful and the product has a cheaper feel.  Even though the old one is all plastic the new one is a significant step back and is softer in construction. I put it through 7 pots of hot water and cleaned with soap and vinegar.  On the last pot of hot water I put in a glass by itself to see if the plastic smell had decreased.  It had not.  Even after brewing coffee, the smell was not masked. It might be BPA free, but there is something left behind in my experience that detracts from the coffee taste I replaced with a Hamilton Beach Steel Carafe model and it doesn't have the issue."
"July 9, 2012",Nikki S.,5.0,,"I love this coffee machine. I drink a lot of coffee and this machine does not give me the burnt coffee taste. I love the dispenser, which eliminates the pouring of my coffee. Easy to use and i love the design. The only thing that i may dislike is where the coffee sits and what you are supposed to use to pour water into the pot is the same, and i cannot get it to just turn on and without water being pot to brew coffee; but the 4 hours of warm time is long enough!"
"February 11, 2016",Isaac J.,4.0,,"GREAT. Wish it was a little taller for travel mugs but other than that, I have no complaints."
"January 7, 2017",Dean V.,5.0,,"The Brew Station was everything that I expected it would be.  Making a great cup of coffee was never so easy, and it keeps the coffee hot, without burning it, for up to 4 hours.  I can enjoy one great cup of coffee at a time.  Clean-up and refilling is a breeze.  Programming the machine is simple and straight forward.  I wake up every morning to the smell of fresh coffee!"

"February 2, 2020",Kim Glass,4.0,,The Writing smudged and ended up coming off but it makes great coffee
"December 18, 2016",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Love that there is not pot to worry about.  Comes apart for easy cleaning.  Also really like how you can adjust the length of time it keeps the coffee hot and has a reheat option.  I highly recommend this if you are tired of dealing with coffee pots and spills.
"October 23, 2016",MBColl,5.0,,"works well, good value"
"April 18, 2014",margaret dodson,2.0,,"We like the set up, the water well on the side and the automatic off, but you have to push against the bar that gives you the coffee so hard that you have to hold the back of the coffee maker so it won't slide across the counter.  I agree that the coffee does not brew very hot.  I actually like the previous version better."
"July 25, 2017",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"While I do really like this machine, there seems to be an issue with the ""perking."" Two-four cups are consistently left sitting in the reservoir, leaving me short on coffee and I use bottled water so I am unsure what the issue is! Sadly the return window closed before I could send it back."
"August 6, 2020",susan evans,5.0,,Love it. Can brew a pot in the morning and stays fresh all day.
"May 19, 2021",Nashville mama bear,1.0,,Busted on first use and coffee spilled all over counters leaving permanent stains.

"May 24, 2017",Chari L. Hoover,3.0,,"Not as easy to use at the dispensing spot. Slow, stiff,  the water reservoir is great easier to fill up. I enjoy the no carafe feature and timed out auto shut off"
"October 7, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,It's a wonderful coffee maker! It even comes with instructions on the back to make iced coffee. Got it for my mom for her birthday (so I can have coffee too) and it works great!
"April 20, 2016",John Kwok,5.0,,EXCELLENT! I would definitely recommend this product best cup of coffee I've had in years. I love it completely 💕👌
"January 4, 2017",marie,5.0,One,I like the slim lines.  Taking up less space on the counter.  It also will keep the coffee hot up to 4 hours.  very easy to program and clean.  I recommend this for anyone wanting a coffee station.
"June 9, 2016",Thomas,5.0,,A very nice unit that is easy to use and very convenient.

"January 6, 2019",Kelly Waisley,3.0,,Easy to use.
"April 8, 2017",Angela Durand,4.0,,I like the entire idea if this system. Only one issue is that it never really is at hot as I would like it to be.
"September 15, 2014",Alan,5.0,2,Great capacity.  Easy to clean.  Only downside so far is the wells under the brewing container are full of water every day and I have to sponge them out.
"April 29, 2019",kathleen petty,2.0,,"we like it, originally....kept coffee, HOT for four hours, and no carafe, to deal with........but, it just stopped working....We have cleaned it, tried everything, in directions, its just not making coffee.........very disappointed, as had it a short time."

"July 4, 2015",Imfanimae,5.0,,Love the look of the machine. Also love that the reservoirs are all contained inside. Pretty easy to clean too. I can make a whole pot of coffee and serve it one cup or travel mug at a time!
"December 5, 2020",Joy,1.0,,"It leaks everywhere...,"
"March 8, 2013",Beth Stern,5.0,,This coffee pot is amazing!  The coffee is always hot and tastes wonderful!  A friend told me about this system and after going through too many coffee pots a year I tried this one.  I HIGHLY recomend it.
"November 23, 2018",S&S,3.0,,Love the concept. Pain to clean and is always dripping wet. Never seems clean
"February 11, 2017",Erik G Walton,3.0,,Loved it but it sprang a leak after less than a year. spout gave out and poured coffee all over my kitchen. Went back to the French press... It maks better coffee anyway...
"August 19, 2019",Marg Thomas,5.0,,"I like it so far, just hope it doesn't leak from the bottom like the last one did"
"October 26, 2011",Mackman,5.0,20,"When I started reviewing this coffee maker I was leery of it because of the negative reviews about the inability to get coffee in the cup without the leakage and the water running down the back when opening the top lid.  I have not had even a drip of coffee leak when filling a cup no matter what type of cup I use.  As far as the water leaking in back when opening the lid, I have found that this is due to condensation from the brewing process and can be eliminated by opening the lid slowly part way for a moment while the condensation flows back into the reservoir. I did not purchase the permanent filter after reading reviews it didn't fit etc.  Instead I took another reviewer's advise and cut down an existing one I had by removing the top ring.  It fits well and have not had any grounds getting into the holding tank because I fill the basket outside of the maker. This coffee maker is engineered so simply it is genius.  Simply to fill and simple to clean; lift out a basket and a reservoir to fill the base and that is it.  The digital controls work simply and effectively.  The coffee is as good as it gets and after 4 hours (my set warming time) it is as fresh tasting as just brewed; no burnt taste from sitting on a carafe warming plate. I wish I had found this type of coffee maker years ago, not only would I have enjoyed much better coffee but saved a lot of $ in the process. EDIT After having this coffeemaker for about six weeks I am still as impressed as when I first received it.  I have had not one problem with it the controls are simple and uncomplicated to use and I am surprised how quickly it will brew 12 cups. A+++"

"February 9, 2020",chen zhang,1.0,,It starts to leak. I have no clue why that could happen. I only bought it for less than a year
"April 13, 2013",Mom8691,5.0,,This is my second Brew Station. The best part is no carafe to wash or break. The coffee brews quickly. Pouring is a one hand operation. Coffee stays hot for up to 3 hours. I would not go back to a carafe style brewer.
"November 15, 2017",P. Teleki,1.0,One,"I bought one of these from Amazon to replace an earlier model that worked for 11 years. If you like your coffee spread out over the counter or dripping onto the floor, buy one. The dispensing valve leaks like a sieve."

"November 16, 2018",Sarah,5.0,,Has been better than expected! Love this! Makes the right amount of coffee we need at a time.
"September 6, 2017",William J Helm III,5.0,,Greatest drip coffee system we've ever used! The only improvement would be to have a much smoother interior so you can wipe it dry after washing. By the way the washing is also very easy and simple! I would recommend this system.
"April 23, 2020",Michael,5.0,,Very good product
"December 25, 2013",R. Henderson,5.0,One,"I bought this for my husband and he seems to like it.  Really great features of dispensing 1 cup at a time and holding the coffee warm for hours if needed.  Programmable, easy to clean and set up."

"May 31, 2016",Richard P. Shackelford,3.0,,"I like everything except the coffee is just at a drinkable temperature.  Pouring into a cold mug, topping off a half a cup of warm coffee or adding cream makes the coffee too cool for me."
"January 14, 2015",Will Thompson,5.0,,Makes great coffee.  I like the options for different brew strengths.  It is great to be able to set it for brewing a small batch when I'm the only one drinking coffee in the morning.
"April 22, 2018",Tammy Adams,1.0,,This is the second one I purchased. The first one lasted one year. The second one was bought on 01-30-18. I had the same issue with both of them. They leak coffee at the bottom. I clean it often and still happens. I will never purchase this one again.
"February 9, 2017",Golden Beetle,5.0,,"makes great coffee, multiple options and easy to remove parts for cleaning."
"June 29, 2013",TPas,5.0,,"Had this coffee machine for a couple of months and love the coffee pot-free design. Modular pieces help in cleaning. Always seem to spill last bit of water during set-up when pouring from coffee-reservoir to water-reservoir, perhaps because I'm not that patient in my pouring. Makes a great pot of coffee. Haven't played around with too many of the options just yet except for the delayed brewing which is easy enough. Pleased with purchase to date."

"January 28, 2015",Shelby B.,1.0,3,"HORRIBLE!!! We have had this coffee make for >4 months and it suddenly just quit working. Not to mention the coffee did NOT stay hot in the container even with additional hours of settting and we had to double our normal amount of grounds when preparing just to get any flavor of the coffee. We were just sucking these points up, but now I'm writing this as it is completely not working and I have no way to send it back and get a refund based on return policy. we just bought a new Mr. Coffee for $23.99 at Target and it is AMAZING! Don't waste your money on this."

"June 16, 2013",Leslie Ridgeway,5.0,,I love this upgraded version. It is smaller and takes up less room on the counter. It works great and all the bad reviews are I think operator error. No splashing not dripping no problems at all. Great product. I would buy it again when this one goes south.

I thought OK one time fluke not a big deal, well now six months later it will NEVER completely cycle. We have to shut it off and re-start it to completely empty the reservoir. I've e-mailed the company today, we'll see what there response is. We're also not overly impressed with the heat of the coffee, but we can live with that."

"November 7, 2015",Sandra H,1.0,,This coffee maker is everything I wanted until after about 3 months it started dripping out of the dispenser.

"November 10, 2016",MTH,5.0,One,"Very nice Coffee Maker for the price. Good Design, a lot of different settings. We came from one of the expensive ($180) CuisinArt programmable coffee makers and when that died, we decided to go with this one. I like how there is no Carafe and you just push to dispense how much coffee you want. Very nice. I also experience the issue when you lift the lid, some of the water from the condensation runs down the back of the coffee maker and all over the counter. If you lift the lid slowly, the water drains back into the coffee maker. Problem solved. It's only water, so no reason to give any negative marks for it. Very easy to clean and assemble."
"August 17, 2016",Amber,4.0,3,"My daughter woke up earlier than us one day and decided to make some tea (yes it's a ""tea pot"" for us). She unplugged the coffee/tea pot and moved it to the floor. Got the filter holder and coffee/tea reservoir out of the fridge, dumped out my barely used tea bags. Got new tea bags and put them in the filter holder, put the coffee pot back on the counter and plugged it in.. Filed the water reservoir and turned on the coffee pot. By the time I got out to the kitchen there was fresh tea already made.. Other than freaking out about the water + electricity issue, the possibility of her breaking my new coffee/tea pot ... And the fact that she wasted my tea bags.. I was pretty impressed that she learned how to use it after only watching me a few times.  Unfortunately since she can't read she also ended up mixing a energizing tea with a sleep tea...  But I'd say she's a pretty smart little girl for being able to do all that on her own. Even though I really like this coffee pot I'm only giving it 4 starts because I think there is room for improvement. I don't like that there's water dripping from the cover to the inside of the appliance itself, it's a pain in the butt to have to dump out. Also, as a stay at home mother, I have tea throughout the day and at night put any leftovers in the fridge (love the removable reservoirs) to warm up and add to the next day, because of this the warming plate is in constant need of cleaning. It's not long after I turn it on that the ""clean"" sign turns on. Guess it's not a big deal, I mostly just find it annoying.. Both the sign and the constant need to clean the plate.  Could also use a longer ""keep warm"" period. :-) Removable reservoirs are great, ""keep warm"" is great, iced coffee/tea is great.. Love the fact that I can use it for tea (bag or loose leaf).. Love the push button dispenser, though it would be nice if the dispenser hole was out farther to accommodate irregular containers and if the button was lower for shorter cups (so you don't have to hold them in the air.. )"
"August 3, 2016",KatieEm,1.0,One,Heating element failed after less than 3 months of once daily use. It just makes slightly coffee flavored water now and it's too late to return it. :(
"September 9, 2015",Don Hoang,4.0,One,"Highly recommended!  I liked the old model and I like the new one even more.  It's more compact, easier to fill with water and easier to clean.  My only (minor) criticism is the rubber feet at the bottom tend to come off it you slide the appliance around on the counter."
"May 2, 2015",TFM,5.0,One,IT is still working well several months after our purchase - I think it is close to a year.  It drips a little slower than our previous model but it's only a matter of a couple of minutes.

"January 16, 2012",valpepper,1.0,One,I purchased this maker in Sept and it quit working in January.  Contacted Hamilton Beach and to get it replaced you have to pay shipping and handling of $15 which is really high in my opinion.  Poor experience and I'd suggest another manufacturer for your coffee needs.

"May 19, 2018",mlAmazon Customer,2.0,,I make coffee daily & program it to be ready when we get up in the a.m.. I've had this for less than 6 months & it was great until the window started flashing & the numbers disappeared. Now it can't be programmed & can not be used to make coffee at all.

"August 20, 2018",Manena Long,1.0,,We have had it for 2 months (of course just past the return window) and it started to leak and drip after dispensing coffee.
"June 27, 2016",joycedaffodil,2.0,,"Unless you like a definite extra step to making coffee do not buy this item.  Heater chamber collects water which must be wiped clean to avoid contact with heating element.  Really disappointing.  Called company and they did replace:  IT IS WORSE.  I know it is an extra step, but very annoying.  Will not buy this item again."
"July 29, 2013",Kathy Meacham,5.0,,this makes a good cup of coffee and is easy to dispense to different cup sizes. preparation can get a little messy when dealing with pouring water in the machine but the goods out weigh the bads.
"June 24, 2019",Sara Roetcisoender,5.0,,Nice
"March 2, 2016",J. Devine,5.0,,"This coffee pot is fantastic, don't know what people are complaining about. This coffee pot delivers very well. I find that I leave the warmer on for 4 hours, and it does a great job of not destroying the flavor. Obviously the longer the coffee sits it loses some of the flavor, but unlike previous pots I have had over the years this one does not burn the coffee within a half hour to useless burnt offerings. Thanks Hamilton Beach - you have delivered well on this one. Pros - keeps well, easy to set up, great coffee consistently cons - have to make sure you rinse the coffee pot out well every time, could be very difficult to clean if you leave coffee in it for extended time (more than a day)"
"January 6, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love it. The coffee tastes amazing.
"February 11, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,My favorite coffeemaker.
"February 11, 2016",kwc,1.0,5,"H B 48465. I won't drink coffee from this machine! I put 5 full batches of water, 2 batches of powdered Dip It, 3 more full batches of water, and the hot water that is dispensed still smells like plastic. In addition, the water in the coffee tank had a residue floating on it and left a ring around the inside of the tank, which had to be cleaned before the subsequent batch of water was added. The cleaning of the tank is an onerous task also, in that the tank walls are not smooth (like my old 47374 Brewstation), but contains numerous projections, nubs, and crevices. I'm returning it to Amazon. I wish reviewers would list which model they are reviewing. I was obvious while reading the reviews that the machine being reviewed was not this one."
"February 15, 2017",rw0540,5.0,,I really like it so far. I had an old version of this one so is nice having a newer and BPA free maker.
"October 6, 2019",Francesca kennedy,5.0,,I love it! This is the third one I will never buy a different one again
"March 12, 2020",Maria C Chappeler,1.0,,"Had to return 2 of them, defected. Both of them licks."
"January 4, 2018",Khaskin,2.0,,"I returned this without even using it. I didn't realize that the ""tank"" inside was plastic. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, except that the heating element inside the tank is a metal plate that is attached directly to the plastic. I don't think it's good to have the plastic so close to that element possibly heating the plastic and leeching into your coffee. It may or may not affect the taste, but just knowing that there is cooked plastic in my coffee was enough for me to NOT want to use it.... Perhaps if the tank was stainless I would've kept it. Now, I know that all coffee makers have some kind of plastic in them, and you probably won't find one that is COMPLETELY safe from it, but for our family, it just seems safer to keep the coffee warm in a traditional glass carafe. The hunt for a new coffee maker is still on."
"January 4, 2020",Shawn,1.0,,Continues to make brewing noise long after brewing is complete. It also leaks from the spout after 6 months. Not recommended.
"July 9, 2014",tia marina,5.0,,my family and i we are very please with  this coffeemaker its easy to use it an keep more clean where you placeit and the price cheapest

"December 26, 2015",K. Kort,5.0,,"So far, this is great! Very easy to make coffee and no leaks. I love the dispenser."
"January 24, 2014",Karst,3.0,,I love the idea and how the coffee stays fresh. The coffee brews quite slow and it's just shy of threading a needle pouring in the water.
"March 23, 2016",Billie,5.0,One,"No harder to maintain than any other coffee maker, super cool dispensing mechanism, the girls in the office enjoy it every day! Great price!"
"December 31, 2013",Jake,5.0,,Switched from a Keurig model. This is a better product.  Easy to use and don't have to bother with overpriced Kcups.  The dispenser is a wonderful feature and I love that it just stores inside.
"January 7, 2021",Jill S.,1.0,,This is the worst coffee maker in the world. Do not buy. It leaks all over the place

"August 29, 2016",Frank Martino,4.0,,Compared to similar coffee makers (especially those using carafes) it's five stars. There are of course other ways to make coffee that are better but they aren't as convenient.
"December 24, 2017",Dallas Sub Sailor,4.0,,Works well now. Let's see how it does over the long haul.
"February 26, 2016",Alex Korzha,5.0,,The coffee tastes good. Glad I didn't believe bad reviews about the taste.
"September 12, 2014",Patty 1sch,4.0,One,"I really like the idea of no carafe and being able to dispense the coffee right into the cup.  I had a similar coffeemaker for several years and didn't have a problem with it.  This one is noisy.  Noisy when it's making the coffee and noisy all the time it's on.  I like the fact that you can adjust the keep warm length up to 4 hours, though.  About a week after using it I noticed it was leaking so call the Hamilton Beach company.  They said it was due to condensation and that every time I finish using the coffeemaker I need to wipe out the area below the coffee tank.  It fills to about 1/2 inch every day!  That's a big negative!"
"April 5, 2016",Groovy Chick,5.0,,I love these kind of coffee pots... no dirty pots to worry about.

"October 19, 2015",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Second one that I have owned.  Liked the first one enough to seek out and buy it again when I needed a new one.  I like the new one even better than the first.
"August 26, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,great coffeemaker
"August 8, 2015",Bill Q,4.0,,Works fine. I like the 4 hour warming time. I like that it only makes a quiet beep when brewing is complete. All in all though I would have rather gotten a standard coffee pot. This is a little more annoying to put together and keep clean.

"June 14, 2015",Ellen Allemand,2.0,,I really would love to replace this item as it did not work this am. The coffee was just warm after it brewed and it is only 6 months old. this is my 3rd Brewmaster. Help!
"October 21, 2016",Anotherpickyshopper,3.0,,"Works fine, but rickety.  Rubber stoppers on bottom, to keep it from sliding all over the counter, came out the first day, so now it slides all over the counter.  I doubt this thing will last long.  My former two versions of this coffee maker lasted several years each and were much sturdier."
"December 12, 2016",Amazon Customer,4.0,,It brews decent coffee. Only small issue I got with it is that there is very thin line between dispensing coffee and pushing whole maker of the counter top  - other then that I really like no carafe solution and holding temperature works really good (coffee does not burn).
"February 18, 2021",Susan PArker,1.0,,I had to return 2 of these due to leaking
"March 25, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"This our second one.  We tried a newer model of this one in between purchases, but that one had a tank on the side that was clunky and not well made.  If you are deciding about a coffeemaker without a carafe,this one is easy to use and makes perfectly brewed coffee.  This is the one."
"February 15, 2014",BB,3.0,,Still not 100% satisfied...have not been successful in getting the timed brewing  to work properly and this a.m.  the keep hot feature had accidently been turned off....Not a good thing on a Saturday morning.

"May 14, 2016",rebecca curtis,5.0,,I have 2 of these coffee makers one for at home and one at our cabin. I love the fact your coffee stays hot but not a burned taste to It even after 3 hours warming.
"October 13, 2016",Sandy,4.0,One,The little nubby rubber feet (only 2) tend to pop off when you attempt to slide the coffee maker on a granite surface.
"February 23, 2016",Arlene T.,5.0,,"This is my second brew station.  It makes excellent coffee.  I don't find it to be messy. I find it easy to use. It does an excellent job of keeping coffee warm.  However, I wish it was easier to load the water chamber."
"June 6, 2019",kaibabfarms,5.0,,Very convenient. Brews fast and no more decanters to clean or break!

"July 8, 2015",evg777,3.0,,Shipped on time and coffee tastes great! Filling the water reservoir not as easy as the previous one I had and the unit seems to weigh less. As with my previous coffee maker I have to pull the unit forward to fill and the silicone grippers on the bottom of the unit keep popping off. But I like the convenience of not having to deal with a coffee pot or carafe so I would probably order again.
"April 28, 2016",John Nichols,5.0,,Love it so far. Super easy to dispense the product no canister to break and easy clean up and reassemble can't beat that. Also it does seem to keep the coffee warmer than the open pot carafe Style that we used to have.

"June 4, 2016",Jo Ann,1.0,One,I am VERY disappointed in this brew station. I had previously had my first brew station for several years and wanted to upgrade to the newer version. I received this one in Feb and as of this morning it has died. Disappointed in it after only 3 months is an understatement. Any product should last longer than this. Upgraded today to the Cuisinart DCC 3000.

I love that there is no coffee pot to deal with, wash or break!  Very easy to use and programmable.  Everything comes apart easily to clean and fill with water, filter and coffee. When the coffee is done, you can use the handle and lift that part out - it has the hot coffee in it now - my husband likes this part, there is a spout and he pours it into his thermos for work :) Love this coffee maker!"
"October 27, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Great coffee pot. No pot to clean.
"January 14, 2018",Kyle Turner,2.0,,"The method of pouring water in the chamber is messy....always. The unit is too lightweight to have a push button dispense method.... it moves when you try to dispense. The warming unit cooks the coffee, too hot makes the taste change. Should consider revising the design and incorporating a chamber that is insulated without a heat source."
"December 31, 2019",Dave,4.0,,"Even in the BOLD setting, the coffee doesn't have a particularly bold flavor..."

"June 8, 2014",2GStyle,4.0,,"Love Hamilton Beach coffee makers, so when my old one went to coffee maker heaven, I wanted something similar. Love that this has a separate container for the water, so no filling the carafe and then pouring into the maker vessel. The container is removable, which is great because my coffee maker is not next to the sink. The major con for me is the bowl where the filter sits has multiple holes for the water to drip, I have found that it brews weaker coffee because of how fast the water goes over the grounds. Its easily fixed by adding more grounds and setting to strong brew, but would love not to use up my coffee as quickly. Overall, still a nice looking, good working maker."
"March 23, 2015",kimmer,5.0,,"We had an older version of this exact coffee maker, but it had been leaking for a long time.  When I ordered this model, my husband was leery, but it's been a few weeks and we LOVE it!  It makes up to twelve cups of coffee for when we have guests, and it's just so easy to use.

"February 11, 2014",Hudson Pringle,5.0,,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband, who is super picky about his coffee and coffee makers. He loves it! We have had no problems with it at all so far and he has used it everyday for the last month and a half. It is easy to take apart and clean, and it looks nice on the counter. It doesn't leak and we haven't had any problems with the depth of the dispenser, as some reviews I had read mentioned. It works fine with a normal size coffee mug. We would highly recommend it. It was a great price too!"
"May 22, 2019",Amazon Customer,5.0,,compact compared to the old model

I decided to turn to amazon and found it cheaper than the store! When it was delivered, I immediately opened it, cleaned it and brewed some coffee!

"March 13, 2017",John H,4.0,One,"I love this thing, I was looking for a new coffee pot and I stumbled on this. Pro's Coffee is contained in a reservoir, I don't have to worry about ""boiled down coffee"" This was the biggest selling point to me. Make good coffee - It must nail the water temperature because my coffee tasted great, I am a coffee snob. Con's It's big - This thing is a lot bigger than my coffee pot, not a deal breaker for me though It's light - The coffee pot will move when you dispense it if you're toward the last 3 cups, make sure you sturdy it with your other hand."
"February 20, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Product was in great shape as promised. We've used this coffee maker before on a vacation trip and this product matched the same one we were looking for. The box was in rough shape upon arrival, but it didn't damage the product at all."

"July 23, 2013",Lildeal,5.0,One,Like this coffee pot because my husband can get his own coffee easily without any help.  He's in middle stages of Alzheimer's Disease and my other pot was too confusing.  (Kuerig :) )

"February 14, 2019",Elta Kilcollins,5.0,,The product is just what I expected it would be. Very satisfied with it. My only problem is that Amazon charged us $20 more than I could buy it here at Bed and Bath. Not very pleased about that. Didn't realize that until after we purchased it.

"February 14, 2017",jenn,3.0,One,"I love the idea of the potless coffee maker. This one looks sleek, is inexpensive and has a few nice features. It brews a decent pot of coffee. You can only keep one pot warm for up to 4 hours. It's not too cumbersome to fill/wash/set up, however there are cheap plastic parts that fall off every time I move it (which is every time I need to refill or wash the basin) Specifically the plate under the spout, and these little rubber feet on the bottom that are meant to stabilize it, but pop off EVERY time I move it a little. I have to pick up entire coffee maker to push it back by the wall when not in use."

"April 3, 2014",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,We bought this to replace our old BrewStation because pouring the water into the back of it was a pain.  The 47950 has a removable water container so we were looking forward to the improvement and it was.  The problem with this coffee maker  is that it boils the coffee in the storage area down to nothing.  We bought two just to see if one was defective but the second one did the same thing.

"September 2, 2014",Johnny Notz,1.0,,I have not even had the coffee maker for two months yet and it has stopped brewing the coffee correctly. The water holder on the side will not sit properly and it will not brew the coffee correctly and sometimes won't even brew it at all! Very frustrating when you spend $50 on a product and it doesn't work properly not even two months after purchase. I will not be buying a Hamilton Beach product again.
"June 25, 2013",JoJo,5.0,,Have had Brewstations before and this one meets the challenge.  Makes a great cup of hot coffee.  Especially like the water reservoir.  Easiest place to pour water into of any coffeepot that I have owned.  LOVE IT!!!

"March 1, 2015",Nick T.,4.0,,This is a great coffee machine and for someone who prefers coffee to espresso I would highly recommend it. Knocking off 1 star because water can build up and eventually overflow but happens rarely and is easy to avoid.

"March 1, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I've been using this kind of coffee maker for a long time.  Absolutely love and highly recommend it!#
"June 5, 2014",MrLeach,5.0,,"This is a great option for those who dont want a traditional coffee brewer, but want that volume of coffee available."
"July 19, 2014",Sally M. Sikora,5.0,,"Easy to clean, but the condensation from the lid drips into the heater base. Must clean out this base whenever the brew station is used or it will leak onto counter space."
"May 31, 2017",Phillip A Dietrich,5.0,,Great coffee maker!  Brews quickly and makes a better cup of coffee than my much pricier Cuisinart pot ever did. Highly recommend !!!
"October 21, 2018",Nicole DiBattista-Rocca,1.0,,We got 4 years out of our first brew station however this purchase has lasted less than 2 years. Replacement should be because we want to not because we have to. Very disappointed.
"March 21, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Love it.  Nice features for price.
"August 19, 2017",David Price,5.0,,"Makes good coffee, easier usage, and easy cleanup."
"December 28, 2018",Kathleen Hoppe,1.0,,"Coffee not very hot at all. Top doesnt close right,Very Disappointed"
"April 26, 2020",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"The burner melts the plastic around it, and puts off toxic fuels And it making me sick."
"November 2, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Works as expected. Had the older one for a while got this as a replacement... Couldn't be happier
"June 2, 2014",KMW,5.0,,Works great. No real issues with anything other than me dripping water all over if I don't pour perfectly. I would buy it again.
"August 24, 2019",rus j,5.0,,coffe pot is easy to use.
"March 13, 2014",ANorth,4.0,,"We have had this for about a year and it works great, no leaking like some mentioned but, I only gave it 4 stars because of the ""Keep Warm"" timer. It has a max setting of 4 hours and you can't turn it back on, so even if there is still coffee in it your only option is to dump it and make another pot. If you try to turn it on without making a new pot, it turns off and beeps constantly telling you to ""pour water"". 4 hours may seem like a long time, but when you have two people who go to work at different times a few hours apart, it's a downfall. My wife has to be at work much earlier than I do, so by the time I have to be up it has shut off and I can't turn it back on to keep the remaining coffee warm. The only option is to brew a new pot. If it had an option to turn the warmer back on I would have given it 5 stars."
"June 20, 2021",Peggy Navarre,5.0,,keeps coffee hot and fresh and no counter mess
"April 13, 2013",rick brescia,5.0,,"mom wants it easy to clean,really easy to use recomended use office,kitchen, mom who really likes it just use your coffe mug...thats it"

"June 21, 2021",Paul,5.0,,Like that there is no glass pot!
"June 29, 2019",Alex,5.0,,Great coffee maker for a guy that drinks a pot in the morning.
"March 23, 2013",brucemn,2.0,,We bought this Hamilton Beach to replace an older HB carafe-less brewstation and ended up returning the new one and just sticking with the old one.  The newer Hamilton Beach is built with cheaper plastic and has a drip tray that won't stay connected to the rest of the brewstation.  It was clear that Hamilton Beach has decided to aim at a lower price point but has done so by building a much cheaper product with cheaper materials.
"August 11, 2016",Anewwayof,5.0,One,"This is the best coffee brewer i have ever purchased, and i highly recommend it!"
"May 6, 2019",L.Passmore,5.0,,"WORKS GREAT, MAKES GREAT COFFEE AND IT KEEPS MY COUNTER NEAT."
"April 1, 2021",Nat Shaddix,1.0,,This coffee maker leaked all over the counter from day one.
"July 3, 2016",Steven R,5.0,One,"Great coffee maker! It keeps the coffee extremely high temp for up to 4 hours which is very convenient. It looks much more sophisticated than your average coffee maker with the glass pot. I've gotten many compliments when people see it in my house. The only downside is filling up large thermos/tumblers. They don't fit straight under the pour spout, however by just tipping the tumbler it's easy to fill. I've had no problems filling large tumblers, just takes a bit of adjustment. Overall I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a new coffee maker, especially if you burned out your old coffee pot, this one has had no troubles. I had previously burned out the last two coffee makers."
"July 5, 2016",thomas greene,5.0,,"this coffee maker works great for me, i have no problems using it, it's so much easier to use with the portable water container , it shows how much coffee is in the brewstation, that's also a very handy feature, coffee tastes great ,and that is how i really rate my coffee makers, i give this a full 5 stars,"
"December 29, 2015",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is the second one of these I have ordered because I love them so much
"June 22, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I absolutely LOVE this Coffee maker.  We had a different model before this one for many years and I love the updated version!
"October 11, 2019",Ed Suliga,2.0,,It leaks !
"January 3, 2016",Lori V,5.0,,"Makes good bold coffee. We have had the older version for many years, Like the fact that this one has a deeper space for taller cups."
"December 20, 2013",SPEET,5.0,,"I just received this machine and love it!  It is a great find for the price.  I have made tea and coffee with this.  So very cool.  I had been using my under the cabinet Black & Decker, which the carafe broke. :( it was stainless steal thermal and discontinued by Black & Decker.)  I tried every possible option to replace it and could not.  I also discovered any left would cost $329.  I don't recall ever paying that for the unit.  In thinking outside the box, I reviewed many many coffee makers and thought I'd give this a try.  I am very happy with this one!!!"
"May 5, 2014",Sharp consumer,5.0,,"Works fine, looks good. Easy to fill and reasonably easy to clean. Bright screen. I like the BOLD option and variable keep-warm times."
"April 19, 2015",The Reader,4.0,,"Makes great coffee, my only complaint is if you use a tall cup it's hard to see how full it is"
"April 9, 2016",cathy,5.0,,This is the third coffee maker I've purchased in a year and this will be the last. I wish I would have found this years ago. This is easy to use and easy to clean and makes great coffee.
"December 21, 2020",Brenda F.,3.0,,The coffee made in this is not hot.  It is just luke warm.
"January 9, 2020",Sharon M.,1.0,,i need to return it it leaks from the bottom
"September 27, 2015",Steve,4.0,,Love this coffee maker. Only flaw is that it's very difficult to add water without spilling
"March 22, 2015",proff,1.0,2,"month and a half old, leaks.cant return it  nuff said..."
"June 2, 2017",rick lamparzyk,5.0,,Great product
"December 10, 2017",Amazon Customer,5.0,,excellent product: this is my 5th or 6th HB BrewStation. They need to redesign the lid so the condensation does not spill onto the counter.
"April 28, 2016",S. Fox,5.0,,"we like this coffee pot. Had another, same brand, loved that one too. Highly recommend!"
"November 23, 2016",karen frances ulrich,5.0,,keeps coffee VERY hot

"October 6, 2019",Dale Schlieve,5.0,,We love this type of coffee maker
"December 16, 2020",Anita King,5.0,,Nothing
"February 24, 2014",Rick Shanklin,5.0,One,Exactly as advertised.  Easy to use and performs better than the lesser priced model (and doesn't leak!).  A real hit!
"January 10, 2017",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Makes great tasting coffee!, but last cup dribbles on and under machine. I need to clean counter after every use. Also, needs to be against a wall or machine will slide on counter. I had a more expensive similar maker that lasted 3 years. I guess my old one was worth the money."
"July 28, 2016",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,This is the second Hamilton Beach coffee maker that we have owned.  This is far better one than the first one we owned and I would recommend this coffee maker to any one who is looking for a good coffee maker.
"November 18, 2017",Bonnie Smith,5.0,,Love
"January 8, 2014",JGP,4.0,,I received this coffee maker fairly quickly which I do appreciate. So easy to do business with Amazon. It is a good little coffee maker for the price and I do recommend this model.
"September 6, 2014",123123,2.0,,worked ok for a while ! then plastic part started to separate &  name of product started to come off.did not keep coffee warm anymore.
"March 29, 2019",thomas sandusky,5.0,,works as good if not better than the more expensive ones
"March 26, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Is very poor quality is water liking also coffee is cool
"January 3, 2020",Eder R.,1.0,,The coffe maker came broken of tbe screen.
"January 30, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Leaks from the bottom.
"May 2, 2018",Dena,4.0,,Great for when you don’t want a whole pot of coffee sitting around.  Works well for the home office user.
"April 13, 2020",Chanelle Hendrickson,1.0,,Quit working after 6 months.
"February 20, 2013",Melinda Goslin,5.0,,"We stayed at a time share and they had this coffee maker.  After using it I found I really liked it so I ordered it and am very happy with it.  No more messy carafe/pot.  It is easy to fill and the coffee comes out very hot!  The only negative is filling a thermos or large carafe but I don't do that very often.  Easy to use, great coffee.  I have had many different coffee makers, grind and brew, etc. this seems to work well for me.  I would highly recommend it."
"January 14, 2017",Thomas Keane,3.0,,needs a light at the fill area.  in the dark you have no idea how full the mug is
"July 19, 2017",j,3.0,,Made of flimsy plastic that fits together very precariously.
"February 18, 2016",Scott D.,3.0,,It's okay I don't like the new design from the last one I had but it seems to work good. When you are rinsing the pot out water builds up under the front plastic plate and drips all over the place when you set it back on the base.
"February 11, 2019",Ashlyn Medina,5.0,,Just what I was looking for!
"July 17, 2019",Tea drinker,1.0,,This machine a trash. don't buy it. used it twice and it keeps saying add water. call Hamilton Beach and they want me to pay $11 to ship a replacement unit to me.
"November 12, 2019",Zach R.,5.0,,Great product.
"July 7, 2016",Constance Shaffer,5.0,,"5 Stars - ""Very happy"""
"February 4, 2014",shashi,5.0,,Our Mr. Coffee machine stopped working one day and we took a look at the other coffee makers on the market.  My husband found this one based on the high reviews.  What a great idea to get rid of the carafe.  Those things break and don't really keep coffee that hot.  The brewstation works great. I have it programmed every morning and it's easy to use and clean.  Highly recommend it.
"May 2, 2019",Connie Krusi,1.0,,This is the second generation of this product we have bought.  Both had a problem with leaking when dispensing and this one was even worse.
"August 28, 2014",KL,5.0,,Wow works great and bought it for a bargain with a scratch that was hardly noticeable! This is our 2nd one like this and we got it very reasonable!
"December 16, 2019",Nancy,2.0,,Doesn’t brew correctly need to start to get all the water used and brew all the coffee
"July 15, 2016",Roxanna Norman,5.0,,Love my new coffee pot easy to use and keeps my coffee hot
